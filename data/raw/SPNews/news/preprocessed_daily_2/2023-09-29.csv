Charles Schwab was also named one of the most trusted investment firms, with consumers ranking Schwab among the top two most trusted financial companies across four categories – ETF/Fund Company, Online Broker, Wealth Management and Banking.The survey scores financial companies on seven key attributes: financially sound/secure; quality of products/services; ethical business practices; privacy and security of personal data; customer service; prices; and sensitivity to customer needs in the current economic and financial climate.""Earning and maintaining our clients’ trust is at the core of what we do at Schwab and drives our Through Clients’ Eyes strategy,"" said Rick Wurster, president of Charles Schwab.

The study was conducted in two phases, with data collected via online surveys.In May, 507 consumers participated in the Phase 1 survey, with respondents drawn from visitors to IBD's Investors.com website and email invitations to IBD readers. Researchers began with 12 trust attributes developed by IBD editors and TechnoMetrica.

Using the seven customer trust attributes arrived at in Phase 1, respondents evaluated the company they most often utilize in each of the eight business lines. The Phase 2 survey had 7,597 respondents, with 1,576 coming from the IBD website or email invitations, 2,041 from the WSJ Opinion Leaders Panel, and 3,980 from TechnoMetrica's network of panel partners.For each of the 79 companies that met minimum inclusion criteria, researchers calculated seven trust components based on the responses to the Phase 2 survey, and combined the seven component scores, using the weights from Phase 1, to arrive at each company's overall Trust Index rating.About Charles SchwabAt Charles Schwab, we believe in the power of investing to help individuals create a better tomorrow.

2,ff0dbcc9-feb1-3cfb-a0dc-b2ee9881b298,SCHW,2023-09-29,Is Schwab Balanced Fund (SWOBX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-balanced-fund-swobx-strong-110006925.html,1695898806,STORY,['SCHW'],"[If you've been stuck searching for Mutual Fund Equity Report funds, consider Schwab Balanced Fund (SWOBX) as a possibility. SWOBX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWOBX. Schwab Balanced Fund debuted in October of 1996. Since then, SWOBX has accumulated assets of about $625.08 million, according to the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by Zifan Tang who has been in charge of the fund since February of 2012.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 5.29%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 3.02%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWOBX over the past three years is 12.59% compared to the category average of 12.25%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 12.91% compared to the category average of 12.82%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.67, which means it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -2.78. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWOBX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.50% compared to the category average of 0.85%. So, SWOBX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $0 and that each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Balanced Fund ( SWOBX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab Balanced Fund ( SWOBX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.Don't stop here for your research on Mutual Fund Equity Report funds. We also have plenty more on our site in order to help you find the best possible fund for your portfolio.

However, it has recorded a Loss Per Share of 5.41. This raises the question: is Western Digital's stock significantly overvalued? This article aims to provide a comprehensive valuation analysis of Western Digital, offering insights into its financial health and growth prospects. Read on to learn more.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with WDC. Click here to check it out. WDC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WDCWestern Digital is a leading vertically integrated supplier of data storage solutions, spanning both hard disk drives and solid-state drives. It forms a practical duopoly with Seagate in the HDD market and is the largest global producer of NAND flash chips for SSDs in a joint venture with competitor Kioxia. Despite a current stock price of $45.33, our GF Value estimates the fair value at $33.98, indicating that the stock might be significantly overvalued.Unveiling Western Digital (WDC)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, derived from historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair trading value of the stock. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Given Western Digital's current price of $45.33 per share, the stock seems to be significantly overvalued according to our GF Value estimation. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.Unveiling Western Digital (WDC)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Western Digital's Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it's crucial to evaluate its financial strength. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide insights into a company's financial health. Western Digital has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.29, ranking worse than 83.22% of 2372 companies in the Hardware industry. Its overall financial strength is 5 out of 10, indicating fair financial health.Story continuesUnveiling Western Digital (WDC)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have consistently been profitable over the long term offer less risk to investors. Western Digital has been profitable 7 over the past 10 years. However, its operating margin is -8.87%, ranking worse than 80.58% of 2456 companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, Western Digital's profitability is ranked 6 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is one of the most critical factors in a company's valuation. Western Digital's 3-year average revenue growth rate ranks worse than 84.56% of 2332 companies in the Hardware industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0%, ranking worse than 0% of 1961 companies in the Hardware industry. This indicates that Western Digital's growth is relatively weak compared to its peers.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, ROIC should be higher than WACC. However, for the past 12 months, Western Digital's ROIC is -6.27, and its WACC is 10.48, indicating potential profitability issues.Unveiling Western Digital (WDC)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn summary, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)'s stock appears to be significantly overvalued. While the company's financial condition and profitability are fair, its growth ranks worse than 0% of 1961 companies in the Hardware industry.

Acuity Brands (AYI), which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Lighting industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this lighting maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 12.03%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Acuity Brands came out with earnings of $3.75 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 per share, representing a surprise of 3.59%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.06 per share, delivering a surprise of 20.47%.For Acuity Brands, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Acuity Brands currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.35%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 4, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Shares have lost about 10.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PVH due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.PVH Corp Q2 Earnings &amp; Revenues Surpass EstimatesPVH Corp posted solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results. The bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results gained from the strong execution of the PVH+ Plan and the continued momentum in its core brands — Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. The company witnessed double-digit revenue growth in its direct-to-consumer business in stores and online.Q2 HighlightsPVH Corp reported adjusted earnings of $1.98 per share, down 4.8% from the year-ago quarter's $1.94. However, the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75.In the fiscal second quarter, revenues rose 4% year over year (up 2% on a constant-currency or cc basis) to $2,207 million and surpassed the consensus mark of $2,186 million. This is mainly driven by the solid performance in its international businesses, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, continued growth in Europe and the North America direct-to-consumer business.Direct-to-consumer revenues grew 11% year over year in the quarter, whereas Wholesale revenues fell 3% year over year. Revenues in the digital channel declined roughly 10% in the quarter under review.The company's gross profit amounted to $1,272.3 million, up 4.3% year over year, surpassing our estimate of $1,267.2 million. The gross margin contracted 40 bps to 57.6% due to price increases, lower freight costs, and a favorable shift in regional and channel mix, which more than offset elevated inventory costs stemming from adverse currency.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.8% year over year to $1,099.5 million but lagged our estimate of $1,107.9.The company’s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $182 million compared with $211 million in the prior-year quarter. Notably, our estimate was pegged at $253.2 million. This is mainly due to higher inventory costs and increased investments to support the company’s strategic initiatives. The metric also included $5 million of favorable foreign currency impacts.Story continuesSegmental AnalysisPVH Corp reports financial results under three segments — Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Revenues from the Calvin Klein segment moved up 3% year over year. Sales from Calvin Klein North America fell 9%, while the same for Calvin Klein International rose 11%.Revenues from the Tommy Hilfiger segment grew 6% year over year in the reported quarter. Revenues were up 6% at Tommy Hilfiger North America and the same rose 6% at Tommy Hilfiger International.The Heritage Brands segment's revenues plunged 11% year over year in the quarter under review.Financial DetailsPVH Corp ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $372.8 million, long-term debt of $1,619.6 million, and stockholders' equity of $5,037.6 million. In the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares for $200 million. It expects to repurchase up to $400 million of stock in 2023.OutlookManagement issued its third-quarter and revised its fiscal 2023 view. For fiscal 2023, revenues are anticipated to grow 3-4% (up 2-3% on a cc basis). This is in sync with our estimate of 3.1% growth.The bottom line is expected to be $9.60, down from the earlier stated $10. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be $10.35, up from the prior mentioned $10. Meanwhile, it reported $3.03 on a GAAP basis and $8.97 on an adjusted basis last year. Each guidance includes a positive impact of 15 cents from favorable currency. The company also expects double-digit growth in the EBIT margin.Interest expenses are likely to be $100 million, suggesting an increase from the prior-year reported figure of $83 million due to higher interest rates. Also, the effective tax rate is expected to be 22%.For third-quarter fiscal 2023, management expects revenue growth in the mid-single digits. The bottom line is likely to be $2.43, whereas it reported a loss of $2.88 in the year-ago quarter on a GAAP basis. Adjusted earnings are likely to be $2.70, whereas it reported $2.6 on an adjusted basis. This view includes favorable currency impacts of 15 cents.Interest expenses for the fiscal third quarter are likely to be $25 million, whereas the company posted $19 million in the year-ago period. The effective tax rate is expected to be 22%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -6% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, PVH has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, PVH has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Administration Officer &amp; Vice Chair, Terrance Dolan, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$39.75 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$32.47. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$2.4m for 76.70k shares. But insiders sold 85.82k shares worth US$3.6m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of U.S. Bancorp shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.U.S. Bancorp Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at U.S. Bancorp. In total, insiders dumped US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes U.S. Bancorp Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. U.S. Bancorp insiders own about US$100m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for U.S. Bancorp that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course U.S. Bancorp may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT), Costco observed weaker trends in discretionary items as it enjoyed strong grocery sales. While Walmart, Target, and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) complained of retail theft pressuring their profit margins and thinning their bottom lines, Costco has its own answer to theft and organized retail crime which is not a big issue for the membership-based warehouse retailer, even without having the scan-and-go technology like the on that the e-commerce titan, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) has.Quarterly HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on September 3rd, Costco made $78.9 billion in revenue that rose 9.4%, beating consensus estimates from LSEG’s consensus estimate of $77.9 billion expected. The membership-based warehouse club earned a net income of $2.2 billion, or $4.86 per share, topping expectations of $4.79 and improving from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to $1.87 billion, or $4.20 per share. Comparable sales expanded 1.1% YoY,  yet only 0.2% in the U.S.But while Walmart and Target are growing their online sales, Costco’s e-commerce sales contracted 0.9% YoY as consumers pull back on online sales items such as furniture, small electronics and jewelry due to elevated costs of living.Observed TrendsShoppers turned to the membership club for groceries but bought fewer big-ticket item. Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti stated that shoppers came more often but spent less with the result being softer sales of pricier items in the U.S., outside of the food category.The amount of an average transaction dropped nearly 4% across the globe, while falling 4.5% in the U.S. Global traffic rose 5.2% and 5% YoY in the U.S.MembershipsSince Covid-19 entered our lives, Costco benefited as Americans cooked more from home and millennials moved to suburban areas which come with bigger pantries. Additionally, inflation made consumers sign up and renew their memberships at Costco, Walmart-owned Sam’s Club and other retail clubs. At the end of the quarter, Costco gathered 71 million paid household members, which translates to almost an 8% YoY rise with 32.3 million paid premium, so-called, executive memberships, also increasing from previous quarter’s 981,000. The premium memberships now make over 45% of paid memberships while contributing to about 73% of total sales. When asked about an increase in membership fee, Galanti replied that it is a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’, but did not specify when that will occur.Story continuesCostco Does It In Its Own WayThe bottom line is that Costco continues to post impressive financial figures in a struggling environment without complaining about theft unlike Walmart and Target, stating that inventory shrinkage has not dramatically increased during the past year. Costco’s identity is not made of embracing every trend as it is known for moving carefully. It will not be following all the footsteps of Amazon nor it will be adding express aisles. Costco is aware that inventory shrunk increased due to rollout of self-checkouts that are present at limited locations, but fortunately, shrink rose less than 0.01 percentage point over the past year.Unlike Amazon, Walmart and Target, people pay to be able to shop at Costco and they do it to take advantage of its pricing. But Costco is also making changes and improving its app, only quietly, but they already resulted in a 46% YoY rise in Costco app installs with unique visitors to the site rising 40% YoY. Although one could never mistake Costco to be Amazon, Costco has never even tried to be the tech-savvy Amazon or even Walmart. Costco, the warehouse club made its own identity and one that is a perfect fit for challenging times like these.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Oil prices climbing toward $100 a barrel has also weighed on the minds of the bulls.Read more: How a government shutdown would impact your money: Student loans, Social Security, investments, and moreThe sour mood has hurt the likes of big-cap tech names such as Netflix (NFLX), with shares off by 15% in the past three weeks (down 13% in the month).

Certainly, there is an economic message or two there.Costco said on its earnings call that it’s not seeing a ""dramatic"" pick-up in thefts (hard to thieve and carry out a 25-pack of paper towels from Costco), which means they are seeing some form of theft pick-up.Consumer confidence hit a four-month low.New data on housing showed home purchases fell.H&amp;M warned about a sales plunge in September, blaming warm weather in Europe for delaying purchases of winter clothes. But hey, my H&amp;M store at Roosevelt Field in New York has been a little empty on the weekend too.BofA warned this week about rising credit delinquencies hitting retailers, with specific concerns cited for Kohl's and Nordstrom.Used car retailer CarMax had a dreadful quarter, with execs blaming rising interest rates for consumers delaying auto purchases. The company also saw a year-over-year pickup in credit losses.Story continuesThat’s a ton of signals that point to growing economic stress that the market likely hasn't adjusted for yet.Are we witnessing the lagged effects of Fed policy? Probably. Are households really feeling that inflation is slowing? Probably not. If people aren’t buying homes or used cars because of higher interest rates, is that a problem for stocks?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the casino industry and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Casino stocks that Pay Dividends. Casino stocks are part of the broader leisure and hospitality industry and are influenced by various factors, including the performance of the overall economy, consumer discretionary spending, and regulatory changes in the gambling industry.The casino industry suffered huge losses in 2020 in the face of the pandemic as the revenue of U.S. casinos dropped by a substantial 31.3%, falling to $30.0 billion. This was the lowest level of revenue seen since 2003, as reported by the American Gaming Association (AGA). However, the industry is showing signs of a strong recovery as people are returning to casinos for gambling. According to a report by AGA, Americans set a new record for gambling in 2022 through November. Casinos and mobile gaming apps in the US made an impressive $54.93 billion in revenue during the first 11 months of the year.The pandemic's challenges forced the casino and gaming industry to adjust to a new way of doing things. Many casinos accelerated their digital transformation efforts, including the adoption of online gambling platforms and the development of mobile apps for casino games and sports betting. This was in response to the increased demand for online gambling during lockdowns and social distancing measures. This adaptation has also spurred significant growth in the industry in the years following the pandemic. According to a report by Research and Markets, the global gambling market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.3% through 2027, reaching $765.89 billion. The report further indicated that the market will grow at a rapid pace because of the legalization of gambling, increasing social media, and the rise in the use of social media.Also Read: 12 Most Profitable Casinos in the WorldAn increasing number of visitors to Macau has caused analysts to predict higher earnings for casinos, even though the overall Chinese market isn't showing strong growth. In July, over 2.7 million visitors came to Macau, which is similar to the numbers before the pandemic, according to a report by Bloomberg. The report further referred to Morgan Stanley’s data and mentioned that the numbers for the latter part of September are showing a good recovery, and bookings for October are looking promising. They expect that during the Golden Week holiday period, the daily gross gaming revenue will reach 750 million patacas, which is equivalent to $93 million.Story continuesCasino stocks are becoming more popular among investors this year because they are expected to grow, and analysts have presented a positive outlook on the sector.

NCLH need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 15, 2023 $6.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Norwegian Cruise shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Norwegian Cruise is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Leisure and Recreation Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 80 cents per share to 70 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Norwegian Cruise right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

MET currently has a market cap of $47.2 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan It Retain Momentum?The answer is yes, thanks to rising estimates, improving operating strength and its cost-curbing initiatives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MetLife’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $7.78, indicating a 13.6% rise from $6.85 a year ago. Over the past month, it witnessed one upward estimate revision against none in the opposite direction. The company beat earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed the same twice.MetLife has undertaken several strategies to control costs and increase efficiencies. Our estimate for adjusted total expenses for 2023 indicates a 7.3% year-over-year decline, which will aid its margins. The company’s direct expense ratio was 12.2% for the second quarter, lower than the 2023 target of 12.6%. The consensus estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $70.9 billion.Despite decreased real estate equity returns, MetLife’s adjusted net investment income is on the rise. The metric jumped 12% year over year to $5,040 million in the second quarter. Earlier, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company stated that it expects pre-tax variable investment income to be around $2 billion for this year.The company’s strong operations in the United States and Asia position the company for long-term growth. We expect adjusted net income growth from both these businesses to be positive this year, which will support its overall performance. Product introductions in Japan favored the results in Asia in the second quarter.Story continuesMET remains in sound financial health, with enough cash and a manageable debt. At the second-quarter end, it had cash and cash equivalents of $15,417 million, significantly higher than its short-term debt of $200 million. Also, it generated free cash flow of $11.9 billion in the trailing 12-month period. With growing operating strength, the figure is expected to rise in the future.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that can hold back MET’s growth. Unfavorable underwriting margins in the Group Benefits business and declining premiums from MetLife Holdings are some of the headwinds faced by the company lately. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive long-term growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the broader Finance are Axis Capital Holdings Limited AXS, HCI Group, Inc. HCI and Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF. While Axis Capital and HCI Group sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Cincinnati Financial carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Axis Capital has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters and missing in one, the average being 9.75%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXS’ 2023 and 2024 EPS is pegged at $8.41 and $9.31, indicating a year-over-year increase of 44.7% and 10.7%, respectively.HCI Group has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 448.4%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCI’s 2023 and 2024 EPS is pegged at $3.25 and $4.35, indicating a year-over-year increase of 159.3% and 33.9%, respectively.Cincinnati Financial has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters and missing in one, the average being 25.25%.

A Comprehensive Guide,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unveiling-gartner-value-really-priced-153918004.html,1695915558,STORY,['IT'],"[In today's trading, Gartner Inc (NYSE:IT) experienced a slight loss of -1.27%, following a modest 3-month gain of 1.28%. Despite these fluctuations, Gartner's Earnings Per Share (EPS) remains an impressive 11.54. This article aims to explore whether Gartner (NYSE:IT) is fairly valued and provides an in-depth analysis of the company's financial health and prospects. Read on to understand Gartner's intrinsic value better.Understanding Gartner Inc (NYSE:IT)IT 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ITBased in Stamford, Conn., Gartner Inc (NYSE:IT) is a leading provider of independent research and analysis on information technology and related industries. Its insightful reports, briefings, and updates are delivered straight to clients' desktops. Gartner's clientele primarily consists of chief information officers and other business executives responsible for planning companies' IT budgets. In addition to its research services, Gartner also offers consulting services and hosts numerous IT conferences globally.With a market cap of $27.20 billion and sales of $5.70 billion, Gartner's current stock price stands at $344.76 per share. This price is compared to its Fair Value (GF Value) of $359.51, indicating that the stock may be fairly valued. To better understand this valuation, let's delve deeper into the company's finances and operations.Unveiling Gartner (IT)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideDeciphering the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade.According to the GF Value, Gartner (NYSE:IT) appears fairly valued. This assessment is based on historical multiples, internal adjustments based on past business growth, and future performance estimates. If the share price significantly surpasses the GF Value Line, the stock may be overpriced, indicating poor future returns. Conversely, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, suggesting higher future returns. Given Gartner's current share price of $344.76, the stock seems fairly valued.Story continuesAs Gartner is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to align with its business growth rate.Unveiling Gartner (IT)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Evaluating Gartner's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with weak financial strength can lead to permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to assess a company's financial strength before purchasing its shares. Key indicators such as the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a good initial perspective. Gartner has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.39, ranking it lower than 78.92% of 2752 companies in the Software industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Gartner's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Unveiling Gartner (IT)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and Growth: A Closer LookInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, typically poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also generally a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Gartner has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company reported a revenue of $5.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $11.54. Its operating margin is 19.99%, which ranks better than 89.01% of 2785 companies in the Software industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Gartner's  profitability  at 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability. Growth  is one of the most important factors in a company's valuation. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. Gartner's average annual revenue growth is 13.1%, ranking it higher than 61.72% of 2414 companies in the Software industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 36.8%, ranking it better than 82.56% of 2007 companies in the Software industry.ROIC vs WACC: A Profitability IndicatorComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another way to assess its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Gartner's ROIC is 12.86, and its WACC is 10.39.Unveiling Gartner (IT)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn summary, Gartner (NYSE:IT) appears to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong.

Ten-year yields fell back from fresh 16-year highs, just as a heavy week of new government debt sales totalling more $130 billion came to an end with Thursday's underwhelming $37 billion auction of oft-unloved 7-year notes.At 4.53% on Friday, the 10-year benchmark was some 15 basis points off Thursday's peak and two-year yields fell back to their lowest since Sept. 18.The recoil in oil and bond yields in turn dragged the dollar back down too - with the index now off more than 1% from Wednesday's high for the year.And stocks breathed a sigh of relief too.Wall Street indexes managed a second day of gains on Thursday and S&amp;P500 futures were about 0.5% higher ahead of the open. The VIX volatility gauge fell back sharply to 16.5.World stocks captured by MSCI's all-country index also broke a 9-day losing streak on Thursday and were up for the second day as the week closed out ahead of China's Golden Week break next week.Story continuesSome optimism from Beijing about a possible year-end summit between President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden helped. U.S. and China are discussing a possible trip to Washington by Xi's top economic-policy aide, Vice Premier He Lifeng, the Wall Street Journal reported, and this could pave the way for Xi's trip to the U.S. in November.There was further good news on the European inflation front. Inflation in the euro zone fell more than forecast to its lowest level in two years in September, suggesting the European Central Bank's diet of interest rate hikes is working and may now end.The Federal Reserve's favoured PCE gauge of inflation is due to be updated for August later on Friday and, just like the consumer price report, is expected to show an uptick in the headline rate of inflation while core rates subside further.Although Fed chief Jerome Powell turned down the chance to address the policy outlook at an event late on Thursday - something many observers reckon may be telling in itself - the noises from his colleagues continued to be equivocal about the chances of another rate rise this year.Citing possible economic data outages due the looming government shutdown, Richmond Fed boss Thomas Barkin said it's not yet clear to him what the central bank needs to do on monetary policy into the end of the year.""It would be hard to figure out what's actually happening in the economy without the jobs data,"" he said, referring to possible delays to next week's employment report.In corporate news, sportswear giant Nike lifted the mood. Its shares surged 8% before today's bell after the firm topped Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit as higher prices for its sneakers and apparel offset a hit from waning demand and persistent cost pressures.In Hong Kong, shares of Nio jumped 9% after Reuters reported, citing sources, the Chinese electric vehicle maker is exploring investment and tech alliances with Mercedes-Benz.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* US August PCE inflation gauge, personal income and spending.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 158 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite edged higher by 0.1%.Solid gains for stocks early on faded as pressure built from within the bond market. After easing earlier in the day on encouraging signals about inflation, Treasury yields got back to rising as the day progressed.The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield returned to 4.58%, where it was late Thursday, after dipping to 4.52%. It's again near its highest level since 2007.Treasurys are seen as some of the safest investments possible, and when they pay higher yields, investors are less likely to pay high prices for stocks and other riskier investments. That’s a big reason why the S&amp;P 500 dropped 4.9% in September to drag what had been a big gain for the year down to 11.7%Treasury yields have been climbing sharply as Wall Street accepts a new normal where the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates high for longer. The Fed is trying to push still-high inflation down to its target, and its main tool of high interest rates does that by trying to slow the economy and hurting prices for investments.The Fed’s main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001, and the central bank indicated last week it may cut interest rates next year by less than it earlier expected.Friday’s economic data showed that not only was inflation a touch cooler than expected in August, so was growth in spending by U.S. consumers. That can be a positive for inflation because it means not as many dollars are pouring into purchases. That in turn could give companies less encouragement to try to raise prices further. But it may also dent what’s been a big driver keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession.“It came to a boil during a hot summer, and the temperature is really starting to come down,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, of spending growth by U.S. consumers. “Higher energy prices, student loan debt repayments and real disposable incomes that have been on a declining trajectory since June doesn’t bode well.”Story continuesOil prices have jumped to their highest level in more than a year, which is pressuring the economy by raising fuel costs for everyone. A barrel of U.S. crude sank 92 cents Friday to settle at $90.79, but it's still up sharply from $70 in June. Brent crude, the international standard, also weakened.The resumption of U.S. student-loan repayments, meanwhile, may funnel more dollars away from the spending by consumers that has helped to keep the economy afloat.Another, more immediate threat for the economy could hit soon as the U.S. government nears another possible federal shutdown. Markets have broadly held up rather well during past shutdowns, but a few crucial economic reports are scheduled for the next couple of weeks.The latest monthly update on the U.S. jobs market is due next week, with a couple of important reports on inflation coming the following week. Postponements of such reports could complicate things for the Fed, which has insisted it will make upcoming decisions on interest rates based on what incoming data say about the economy. The Fed's next meeting on rates ends on Nov. 1.On Wall Street, Nike jumped 6.7% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Strength overseas helped it make up for some declines in North America.Blue Apron soared 134.5% after the meal kit company said it was being bought by Wonder Group for $13 per share in cash in a deal valued at $103 million.On the losing end of Wall Street were stocks of energy producers, hurt by the slide in oil's price. Energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 fell 2% as a group, more than double the loss of any of the other 10 sectors that make up the index.Exxon Mobil fell 1.6%, and Schlumberger dropped 4.3%. Energy stocks, though, remain the market’s standout performers since the summer.Shares of Ford and General Motors slipped after the United Auto Workers said it will expand its limited strike to include another facility for each. Ford fell 1.1%, and GM dipped 0.6%.All told, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 11.65 points to 4,288.05. The Dow dropped 158.84 to 33,507.50, and the Nasdaq added 18.05 to 13,219.32.In stock markets abroad, indexes were modestly higher in Europe after exchanges were closed across much of Asia.___AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.]"

That's largely because of a supply-demand imbalance in the oil market, which is likely to worsen over the next year and push prices higher, Currie said.Currie, who has warned of triple-digit oil prices since late 2022, said there's increased demand for crude, noting that last week saw prices near $100.""What was driving it is demand is exceeding expectations. You're up more than half a million barrels per day above even our bullish expectations,"" he said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday.He also reiterated his call for a commodities ""supercycle,"" referring to a bullish period where commodity prices climb as a result of chronic underinvestment and undersupply.Demand outweighing supply has helped pushed crude prices higher through 2023, with oil surging to a 10-month-high after OPEC+ implemented its hefty supply cuts this summer. Brent crude traded around $95 a barrel on Thursday, while West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $92 a barrel.While Currie estimated demand destruction would occur when oil hits $125-$130, experts say rising oil prices spell more pain for Americans and potentially more trouble for the US economy.That's because higher prices at the gas pump could translate into weaker consumer sentiment, which could hit spending, corporate profits, and eventually, economic growth.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The more liquid Brent December contract was settled down 90 cents to $92.20 per barrel.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled down 92 cents to $90.97, up 1% in the week and 29% in the quarter.With oil futures inching closer to $100 a barrel, many investors took profits on the rally given ongoing macroeconomic concerns.""WTI has been the belle of the ball, but today it's losing its luster,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York, citing profit taking and economic concerns.Oil and gas activity in three U.S. energy producing states has been rising with the latest jump in prices, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.In July, U.S. crude production grew to its highest since November 2019, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.Investors looked ahead to a potential partial U.S. government shutdown on Sunday, an ""unnecessary risk"" to a resilient U.S. economy, top White House economic adviser Lael Brainard said.Worries about the Chinese economy also intensified as shares of indebted property developer Evergrande Group were suspended until further notice following a report that its chairman had been placed under police watch.The U.S. oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by seven to 623 in the week to Sept. 29, the lowest since February 2022, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report on Friday.While the total rig count fell by 51 in the third quarter, the cuts have slowed compared with a reduction of 81 in the second quarter as oil prices have rebounded due to tightening supplies.Story continuesBrent is forecast to average $89.85 a barrel in the fourth quarter and $86.45 in 2024, according to a survey of 42 economists compiled by Reuters on Friday.The OPEC+ ministerial panel meeting will take place on Oct. 4 and there is ""increasing probability the voluntary supply cuts by Aramco are reduced,"" National Australia Bank analysts said in a client note, referring to Saudi Arabia's state oil producer.The supply cuts announced by Saudi Arabia and Russia are expected to dominate oil prices for the remainder of this year.However, a run towards $100 per barrel could be short-lived because of ""the artificial nature of supply shortages in the system, and the fragile macro environment"", said Suvro Sarkar, energy sector team lead at DBS Bank.(Additional reporting by Robert Harvey, Katya Golubkova; Editing by Sonali Paul, Mark Potter, Paul Simao, Jan Harvey and David Gregorio)]"

Still, some in the industry have warned of even higher valuations to come — as much as $150 a barrel.But according to McNally, persistently high oil prices may lead to plunging demand, something that Saudi Arabia will want to avoid.""The odds are higher than the market is currently discounting that the Saudis will take their foot off the brake sooner,"" he said. ""They do not want to deliberately over tighten the market, because if you get a spike, then you get the demand collapse and you get a bust. They don't want that.""Already, the world's top oil exporter has shown some openness to easing its oil production cuts, McNally said. For instance, during the last announcement about extending its cuts, Riyadh emphasized that output would be reviewed each month, and for the first time noted a possible production increase.Any decision to lift the cuts may come as soon as October or November, he estimated.Alongside its partners in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the kingdom has limited oil output since July and has since slowed production to around 9 million barrels a day.OPEC data from this month has highlighted a widening imbalance between oil demand and supply due to the production cuts, which could spark the biggest oil deficit since 2007 in the next quarter.Saudi Arabia has an incentive to for oil prices to reach the $100 level, as the country looks to use export revenue to diversify its economy away from petroleum.Story continuesThat's as the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund plans to spend $40 billion annually on domestic investments, which includes the construction of a futuristic city called Neom.But market veteran Ed Yardeni wrote in a Thursday note that $100 oil will hurt demand and risks triggering a global recession if consumers cut spending.

Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance.

FE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FEFirstEnergy Corp (FE): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 3/10GF Value rank: 6/10Momentum rank: 4/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned FirstEnergy Corp the GF Score of 67 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.FirstEnergy Corp Business OverviewFirstEnergy Corp, with a market cap of $19.82 billion, is an investor-owned holding company with 10 regulated distribution utilities across six mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states. The company also owns and operates one of the nation's largest electric transmission systems. With sales of $12.89 billion and an operating margin of 16.04%, FirstEnergy Corp has established a significant presence in its industry.FirstEnergy Corp (FE): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisFirstEnergy Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.18 positions it worse than 76.39% of 432 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.Story continuesThe company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.72, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.28, which is worse than 89.25% of 456 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 6.22, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 74.04% of 443 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where FirstEnergy Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. Lastly, FirstEnergy Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.FirstEnergy Corp (FE): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven FirstEnergy Corp's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While the company has a strong presence in its industry, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Certainly, there is an economic message or two there.Costco said on its earnings call that it’s not seeing a ""dramatic"" pick-up in thefts (hard to thieve and carry out a 25-pack of paper towels from Costco), which means they are seeing some form of theft pick-up.Consumer confidence hit a four-month low.New data on housing showed home purchases fell.H&amp;M warned about a sales plunge in September, blaming warm weather in Europe for delaying purchases of winter clothes. But hey, my H&amp;M store at Roosevelt Field in New York has been a little empty on the weekend too.BofA warned this week about rising credit delinquencies hitting retailers, with specific concerns cited for Kohl's and Nordstrom.Used car retailer CarMax had a dreadful quarter, with execs blaming rising interest rates for consumers delaying auto purchases. The company also saw a year-over-year pickup in credit losses.Story continuesThat’s a ton of signals that point to growing economic stress that the market likely hasn't adjusted for yet.Are we witnessing the lagged effects of Fed policy? Probably. Are households really feeling that inflation is slowing? Probably not. If people aren’t buying homes or used cars because of higher interest rates, is that a problem for stocks? Yes, it should be.Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsA brown bear inspects a pumpkin in its enclosure at Pairi Daiza animal park in Brugelette on Oct. 30, 2020.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Recent Activist Investor Campaigns.It's never a dull day in the markets with activist investors deploying all kinds of strategies in the race to unlock and maximize hidden value in highly undervalued stocks. Since 2017, campaigns by activist investors that purchase minority stakes and push for strategic changes have been on the rise. While the activism eased during the Covid 19 pandemic, they have increased in recent years with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the opening up of the global economy.The impact of activist investors is growing in the US and worldwide, depicted by a tidal wave of campaigns spread far and wide. Often referred to as corporate raiders, activist investors acquire minority stakes in companies they feel are trading below their fair value. They buy stakes to influence management, operations, and policies to try and unlock any hidden value.Activist investor's ultimate goal is to improve the performance and value of the companies they invest in. Consequently, they use tactics not limited to public campaigns or private negotiations. In extreme cases, they engineer proxy fights calling for management changes and seats on the board in the race to influence policies.Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman, Nelson Peltz, and Daniel Loeb are some of the notable names called in the same breath with the biggest activist campaigns. The corporate raiders have been on a roll in recent years, with most engineering campaigns on stock valuations tanking at the height of the pandemic. In the race to pursue strong financial returns and strategic accountability, investors are increasingly taking on executives they feel are underperforming.Activist's campaigns were on a roll in 2022, buoyed by tumbling markets that provided a leeway for activist investors to target stocks that had plunged significantly. More than 900 companies were targeted by activist investors, up 6% from 2021.Story continuesIn the first quarter of 2023, 69 new activist campaigns were the second-highest number since 2019. By the end of the year’s first half, there were about 850 campaigns, much higher than the 762 campaigns recorded in the first half of 2022. Additionally, 85% of the campaigns had an ESG component, with corporate governance the most common theme.Stocks in the consumer goods industry remain the most targeted as they play host to larger companies with low debt levels and strong cash generation prospects. Their scale often offers activist investors a reason to push for cost-cutting and divestments, operational improvements, and adoption of new technologies.Activist campaigns targeting financial institutions surged by more than 60% in the first half of the year as the banking crisis was escalating in the US. However, the scrutiny eased as the half came to an end amid improving fundamentals.In the first half of the year, activist campaigns targeting the Technology sector stood at 25%, followed by Industrial at 21% and Healthcare at 13%. The campaigns were vast and concentrated on companies with a market capitalization of above $10 billion at 24% of the campaigns. A good number of the campaigns also came with M&amp;A demands. On the other, activism has increased in the Utilities sector amid deteriorating performance on concerns about the economy. The health services sector has not been spared either.The increase in activist campaigns came with a new trend dubbed swarming that involves pursuing campaigns in companies already targeted by activists. Some of the companies targeted as part of the new strategy included salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (NYSE:BAYRY), and Seven &amp; i Holdings.15 Recent Activist Investor CampaignsSource:unsplashIn addition, activist campaigns used to be more relaxed than they were. In the past, the corporate raiders would take a strong stand and fight through a proxy contest. The companies are listening to shareholders more and engineer board nominations to influence policies. Proxy fights and lawsuits appear to have taken a back seat.In recent years, activist investors have also been looking into Europe as a more attractive market, which explains why the region accounted for the lion's share of new campaigns. While there was a 34% decline in activist campaigns early in the year in the US, there was a 30% increase in Europe. Activist investors are increasingly targeting large European companies offering greater growth and returns potential.Despite the uncertainties in the global markets amid monetary policy disparity and recession risks, activist investors continue to push companies with the number of global campaigns holding above the four-year average.Our MethodologyActivist campaigns are always cropping as institutional investors like hedge funds scan the market for undervalued stocks that can generate significant returns once strategic alternatives are triggered. We have compiled a list of the most recent activist campaigns an ranked them based on when they occurred.15. Trian Partners at The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Activist Campaign: February 2023The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was the subject of an aggressive activist investor campaign early in the year over claims it was in crisis for shedding more than $120 billion in market value in 2022. Trian Partners was the lead activist investor pushing for strategic changes at the entertainment company to try and maximize shareholder value.Trian Partners’ Nelson Peltz started making the case for replacing Michael Forman in the media and entertainment conglomerate. Trian, which held $1 billion worth of stakes in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), did not spell out reasons for its call.However, a back and forth between the activist investor and the company would end after Disney delivered a raft of business initiatives, including plans to reinstate dividends by the end of the year. Trian dropped its campaign after the announcement.14. Third Point at SiriusPoint Ltd. (NYSE:SPNT) Activist Campaign: April 2023SiriusPoint Ltd. (NYSE:SPNT) is a company that offers insurance and reinsurance products and services for various lines worldwide. It's been targeted by activist investors, the most recent being from Third Point, which owns a 9% stake in the company valued at about $1.4 billion.The activist investor considered taking the insurance company private as one of the ways of unlocking shareholder value. However, the activist investor could not reach an agreement with SiriusPoint Ltd. (NYSE:SPNT), hence pulling back on any deal.13. Politan Capital at Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI)Activist Campaign: May 2023Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI), a monitoring technologies, automation, and connectivity solutions company, has been targeted by Politan Capital, which holds a 9% stake. The activist investor kicked off a proxy battle in May with the aim of fixing what it dubbed as broken corporate governance.The investor cited the $5 billion drop in market value after the company reached a deal to acquire audio company Sound United for $1 billion. Politan Capital also raised concerns about Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI)'s capital allocation and board oversight.In addition, the activist investor has taken issue with what it terms an unfocused strategy, therefore calling for management change. The size of the CEO and founder employment agreement also aggrieved it.The proxy battle would come to an end after shareholders voted in favor of the hedge fund nominees to the board. The activist investor has since put the activism aside, opting to work from inside to try and unlock value.12. Elliot Management at Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Activist Campaign: May 2023After a turbulent 2022 that saw Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) come under pressure, it would catch the attention of activist investor Elliot Management at the turn of the year. The activist investor started pushing for strategic alternatives that it felt would impact the company's fortunes.The hedge fund started pushing for its own candidates in the company as one of the largest shareholders with stakes valued at billions of dollars. Nevertheless, the push for board seats would only last a short time as Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) delivered impressive Q4 results, prompting the hedge fund to reconsider its stance. In a joint statement, it emerged Elliott Management won't be pursuing its director nomination, averting a potential proxy fight.11. Carl Icahn at Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN)Activist Campaign: May 2023Carl Icahn, an activist investor, has launched a fierce proxy fight with Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), a company that makes and sells life science tools and integrated systems.Early in the year, Icahn accused the board of poor oversight, especially with regard to the acquisition of cancer test maker Grail for $7.1 billion.Icahn's resistance to the deal stems from Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN)'s decision to close it without approval from antitrust regulators in the US and Europe. The activist investor embarked on a campaign urging the company to unwind the absurd and questionable deal. He also called for the CEO to step down while pushing for board seats.The activist investor garnered enough support in May to oust the biotech company's board chair, John Thompson, in May. However, CEO Francis DE Souza survived the chop from the nine board members. Icahn also ended with three seats on the board.10. Jana Partners at Freshpet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRPT)Activist Campaign: May 2023Freshpet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRPT), a company that manufactures and sells natural fresh meals and treats for dogs and cats, has been the subject of a fierce activist investor campaign. Jana Partners has been pushing for aggressive changes at the company after acquiring stakes when the company's stock dropped by 74% last year.At the time of the investment, the activist investor felt the company was mismanaged and needed management and board changes. Consequently, it waged an activist campaign that resulted in the firm gaining four seats on the board in May, which it is using to advocate for changes.Jana Partners has been pushing for changes in how the company allocates capital and its corporate governance. The appointment of four directors leaves it in a solid position to supervise capital expenditures and position it for a possible sale.9. CAS Investment Partners at Cardlytics, Inc.

The hedge fund also proposed five people to be nominated as a replacement. Discussion between the firm and the company broke down on May 5 as Cannell Capital dubbed the proposed agreement as too restrictive.The proposed agreement required the hedge fund to offer support to all board measures over the next two years in exchange for appointing a nominee.6. Legion Partners Asset Management at OneSpan Inc. (NASDAQ:OSPN)Activist Campaign: August 2023OneSpan is a company that designs, develops, and markets digital solutions for identity authentication. The company is the subject of an activist campaign by investment firm Legion Partners Asset Management, which believes the company is going in the wrong direction.The firm has since written a letter to the company; making it known it is not happy with the push to pivot away from growth and pushes to focus on cash flow optimization and capital returns. The hedge fund believes the proposed changes are a distraction to the company's bid to achieve fair value for shareholders.Therefore, it is calling on management to focus on committing 30% off plus adjusted margins for earnings before interest taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It also wants the company to increase its capital returns by more than $ 50 million and pursue a possible sale of the company.Click to continue reading and see 5 Recent Activist Investor Campaigns.Suggested articles:30 Low Cost Business Ideas With High Profit12 Best Global ETFs to Buy15 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Under $5Disclosure: None. 15 Recent Activist Investor Campaigns is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

EMR is poised for growth on the back of solid demand across the process and hybrid markets, and improving supply chains despite headwinds from rising cost of sales, restructuring expenses and adverse foreign currency movements.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that are aiding this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Business Strength: Strong demand in the process and hybrid markets is boosting underlying EMR’s orders (up 3% in the fiscal third quarter). The company anticipates double-digit sales growth for the process end market in 2023, driven by growth in energy transition and energy security. For hybrid, the company expects a low double-digit increase in sales due to strength in the life sciences, metals and mining markets.A robust demand environment and improving supply chains are supporting underlying sales growth (up 14% in the fiscal third quarter). Within the Intelligent Devices business unit, the company is seeing strength in the measurement and analytical, and final control businesses due to strong demand in the hybrid and process end markets. Revenues from the unit increased 7% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Improved supply chains, easier availability of electronic components, and strong backlogs are driving growth of the Software and Control business group. Revenues from the unit jumped 27% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Given the strength across its end markets, Emerson has raised its fiscal 2023 guidance. For fiscal 2023, the company expects net sales to increase 10.5% compared with a rise of 9-10.5% predicted earlier. Underlying sales are expected to increase approximately 10% compared with 8.5-10% rise estimated earlier. Adjusted earnings per share are predicted to be between $4.40 and $4.45 compared with $4.15–$4.25 forecasted earlier.Expansion Initiatives: Acquisitions have been Emerson's preferred mode of business expansion so far. In August, the company announced two separate deals to acquire Afag and Flexim. The acquisition of Afag will expand Emerson’s capabilities in factory automation, helping the company expand into lucrative end markets — battery manufacturing, automotive, packaging, medical, life sciences and electronics — currently served by Afag. The acquisition of Flexim will add to EMR’s existing flow measurement positions in coriolis, differential pressure, magmeter and vortex flow measurement and expand its automation portfolio and measurement capabilities. Both acquisitions are expected to close by the end of Emerson’s fiscal 2023.Emerson’s move to acquire National Instruments in an $8.2 billion deal is aligned with its focus on global automation to drive growth and profitability. The acquisition, expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2024, will strengthen EMR’s global automation foothold, helping the company expand into high-growth end markets, including semiconductor and electronics, transportation and electric vehicles and aerospace and defense.Apart from expanding automation capabilities, the acquisition will open up industrial software opportunities for EMR. Emerson expects the transaction to generate cost savings of $165 million by the end of the fifth year upon completion. The buyout is expected to be immediately accretive to EMR’s adjusted earnings. The acquisition will also generate significant recurring revenues and improve EMR’s gross margins.Rewards to Shareholders: Strong cash flows (free cash flow was up 47% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023) allow Emerson to effectively deploy capital to repurchase shares and pay out dividends. In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the company paid dividends of $900 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, EMR had completed its target to buyback $2 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2023. For 2023, the company expects to pay out dividends of approximately $1.2 billion. The company expects free cash flow of $2.2-$2.3 billion for fiscal 2023.Price Performance: Backed by the abovementioned tailwinds, Emerson’s shares have outperformed its industry in a year. The stock gained 30.6% in a year compared with the industry’s 28.3% increase.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Flowserve Corporation FLS presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

50,33451098-c4b8-36dd-8ff4-0ba13f5fe6f4,MSI,2023-09-29,What Makes Motorola (MSI) a New Strong Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-motorola-msi-strong-buy-160005112.html,1695916805,STORY,['MSI'],"[Investors might want to bet on Motorola (MSI), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Motorola basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Motorola imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for MotorolaFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this communications equipment maker is expected to earn $11.45 per share, which is a change of 10.5% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Motorola. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.7%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Motorola to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

JBL reported relatively modest fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results (ending Aug 31, 2023), with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The company reported a revenue contraction year over year, owing to demand softness in several key end markets.Net IncomeGAAP net income during the quarter declined to $155 million or $1.15 per share from $315 million or $2.25 per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to lower revenues and higher income tax expenses.Non-GAAP net income in the reported quarter was $328 million or $2.45 per share compared with $329 million or $2.34 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.31.For fiscal 2023, net income on a GAAP basis was $818 million or $6.02 per share compared with $996 million or $6.90 per share in fiscal 2022. Non-GAAP net income improved to $1,172 million or $8.63 per share from $1,105 million or $7.65 per share in fiscal 2022.Jabil, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseJabil, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Jabil, Inc. QuoteRevenuesNet sales during the quarter totaled $8,458 million, down from $9,030 million in the prior-year quarter. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $8,498 million. Weak demand trends in the Electronics Manufacturing Services vertical impacted the top line.Revenues from Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS) remained relatively flat year over year. However, net sales from Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) were down 13% from the prior-year quarter.For fiscal 2023, the company generated $34,702 million in revenues compared with $33,478 million in fiscal 2022. Positive momentum in auto &amp; transportation, and healthcare supported the top line. However, weakness in 5G wireless, cloud and connected devices impeded the revenue growth.For fiscal 2023, net sales from the DMS vertical were $18 billion, up 8% from fiscal 2022. The top line beat our estimate of $17.8 billion. Revenues from the EMS vertical remained flat at $16.7 billion. The top line fell short of our revenue estimate of $17 billion.Story continuesOther DetailsGross profit was $766 million, up from $729 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating income rose to $477 million from $447 million in the year-ago quarter, owing to improved gross margin.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityIn fiscal 2023, Jabil generated $1,734 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $1,651 million in fiscal 2022. As of Aug 31, 2023, the company had $1,804 million in cash and cash equivalents, with $2,875 million of notes payable and long-term debt with respective figures of $1,478 million and $2,575 million in the year-ago period.OutlookFor first-quarter fiscal 2024, revenues are estimated in the range of $8.4-$9 billion. Revenue from the DMS segment is anticipated to be around $5.1 billion and net sales from the EMS vertical are estimated around $3.6 billion. Non-GAAP operating income is expected in the band of $474-$534 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share within the range of $2.40-$2.80.With the divesture of the Mobility business, management is aiming to accelerate investment in secular growth areas such as electric vehicle, healthcare, renewable energy and AI cloud data centers.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderJabil currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Motorola Solutions, Inc.

AKAM recently launched seven new core compute regions worldwide as part of its concerted effort to realize the vision of a modern decentralized cloud network operator. With this, the company has opened 13 new core compute regions across the globe in the past 90 days, connecting them to its wide edge network that has a distributed footprint spanning 131 countries.The newly added locations are Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Jakarta, Indonesia; Los Angeles, CA; Miami, FL; Milan, Italy; Osaka, Japan; and Sao Paulo, Brazil. The distributed and decentralized cloud architecture enables Akamai to achieve a low-latency globally scalable design and expand its cloud computing network to key data-intensive connection points that enable customers to bring improved connectivity and experience to end users.The choice of locations for opening the fresh core compute regions speaks volumes of a well-orchestrated game plan to strengthen its footprint in places of strategic importance. While Amsterdam is home to the second-largest Internet exchange in the world, Los Angeles is deemed a leader in the global media and entertainment market. Sao Paulo and Miami are considered to be prime locations for facilitating improved connectivity in Latin America. Jakarta and Osaka are likely to offer Akamai a rapidly growing digital economy in Indonesia and Japan, respectively.Akamai handles approximately 2 trillion web interactions on a daily basis. Its solutions help customers address the challenges of bandwidth constraints and Internet traffic while reducing the need for additional hardware to manage traffic loads. The company’s cloud optimization solutions help organizations to improve performance, increase availability and enhance the security of applications and key web assets delivered from data centers to the end user.The buyout of Linode, a leading Infrastructure-as-a-service platform provider, has leapfrogged it as one of the world’s most distributed compute platforms from cloud to edge. We believe that strong growth in demand for online media and entertainment (High-Definition video) over the Internet and gaming will drive bandwidth requirements, thereby accelerating demand for Akamai Connected Cloud in the long haul.The stock has gained 30% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 29.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAkamai presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The talks were exploratory and never reached an advanced stage, they said.Over the years, the companies have discussed other ways to make Bing the preferred option, though Apple ultimately stuck with Google. Those talks have taken on fresh significance now that the US Department of Justice is in a legal fight with Google to show that the company abused its search dominance. Apple’s relationship with Google, which pays billions of dollars to give its search engine a prime spot in the iPhone and other devices, is central to the case.Representatives from Microsoft and Apple declined to comment.Read More: Apple, Google Agreed to ‘Defend’ Search Deal From RegulatorsMicrosoft launched Bing in 2009 as a rival to Google, but the property has never gained market share in a meaningful way. Google still rules the industry, with Bing accounting for less than 10% of searches.Apple and Microsoft are now embroiled in the government’s suit against Google, with executives from both companies testifying at the ongoing trial. The Justice Department is using the Apple deal as evidence that Google unfairly dominates the search market. In testimony earlier this week, Apple’s Cue pushed back on that assertion, saying his company uses Google because it’s the best search option available.Story continuesApple and Google struck their first search engine accord in 2002, ahead of Apple releasing its first Mac web browser. Over time, the agreement expanded to Apple’s new devices, most notably the iPhone. By 2020, Apple was collecting $4 billion to $7 billion annually from the arrangement, according to the DOJ.The agreement covers the Safari web browser for the iPhone, iPad and Mac, and the Cupertino, California-based company gets a percentage of the revenue that Google makes from searches in the Apple browser.The money generated by the Google deal was a key reason why Apple declined acquiring Bing, according to the people. The company also had concerns about Bing’s ability to compete with Google in quality and capabilities, they said.Still, Apple has used Bing in parts of its operations. The Microsoft product was its default web search engine inside of Siri and Spotlight — the feature that conducts searches from the iPhone and iPad home screen — between 2013 and 2017. But the company reverted back to Google in 2017 as part of an updated revenue-sharing agreement. Bing remains an option for Safari search.In court on Thursday, Microsoft business development executive Jon Tinter said that his company weighed making a multibillion-dollar investment in its relationship with Apple in 2016, an effort to outspend Google and make Bing the default option on Apple devices. The chief executive officers of both companies, Tim Cook and Satya Nadella, even met to discuss a deal, Tinter said.Today, Google remains the search engine inside of Siri and Spotlight, as well as the default option in Safari. During his testimony, Cue said that the Apple and Google deal was extended in 2021. That would have been a year or more after Microsoft’s pitch to sell Apple its Bing unit.Cue implied that Bing’s technology was inferior to Google’s, saying that he doesn’t “know what we would have done” if negotiations with Google ever fell apart.If Apple had ultimately purchased Bing, it’s unlikely that the company would have simply integrated the brand into its platform. With past acquisitions, Apple has bought underlying technology and resources in order to build a new feature.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas. It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmerica’s High EV Costs Are Driving Buyers to HybridsCan AI Beat the Market?

Google will likely argue that the better quality of its products are the reason for its success rather than illegal behavior.CONTEXT* The government has argued that Google, which has some 90% of the search market, illegally paid $10 billion annually to smartphone makers like Apple and wireless carriers like AT&amp;T and others to be the default in search on their devices in order to stay on top.* The clout in search makes Google a heavy hitter in the lucrative advertising market, boosting its profits.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Howard Goller)]"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Gibson.John Gibson: Thank you, Shelby. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal year '24 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Schrader, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. The teleconference is being broadcast online and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start the call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter. I'll then turn it over to Efrain and Bob for a financial update, and then, we'll open it up for your questions.PAYXAndrey_Popov/shutterstock.comBut before getting into the discussion of our earnings results, I want to take a brief moment here to make a few brief comments to acknowledge Efrain Rivera, who announced his intention to retire as CFO effective October 12, 2023; though he will remain as a Senior Advisor at least through the end of the calendar year. Efrain has been a valuable member of this senior leadership team at Paychex for the past 12 years. He has provided strong financial stewardship, but more importantly, great strategic leadership as well. During his time with Paychex, the company has transformed into a technology-enabled services company and we significantly expanded our HR Solutions and capabilities. Efrain has been a key strategic advisor and a catalyst for this transformation.Story continuesEfrain, I think you know how truly I appreciate your intellectual wisdom, your integrity, the guidance you've given me personally over my decade here and to the company. And we are all in great gratitude for what you've done for each one of us personally and for the company. Our customers, our employees and our shareholders are better off because you were here. So, thank you. Joining us today is Bob Schrader, who will succeed Efrain as CFO. Bob joined Paychex back in 2014 and is taking on progressive leadership roles over the past nine years, including over the last year and a half since I was named President and subsequent CEO of being co-lead of many of our strategic review efforts and strategic initiatives. Bob's promotion is a part of a strategic succession plan to bring in an innovative leader who will continue to guide the company going forward.I want to congratulate Bob and, Bob, I look forward to continuing to work with you as I have in the last 10 years, I mean, as we continue to -- continue our track record of delivering strong financial results and continuing to position Paychex as a leader and innovator and a company that you can count on for predictable and sustainable results. Now, moving on to the first quarter results, speaking of predictability and sustainability. We have begun the fiscal year '24 with solid growth of 7% in total revenue and 11% in adjusted diluted earnings per share. We've seen operating margin expansion approximately 60 basis points year-over-year, while still investing in our business to drive future growth. Our first quarter reflected solid execution by our sales, service and all of our teams across Paychex.The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions continued, resulting in strong quarter new sales, revenue growth, we saw positive trends in client, revenue and HR outsourcing worksite employee retention during the quarter, and we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. We are starting to see improvements in some of our key PEO and insurance metrics during the quarter, with good results across sales activity, insurance attachment and retention. We will know more after our open enrollment season is completed, which primarily runs from October through January, but at this time, we believe that the actions we have taken in response to the headwinds we faced in 2023 are beginning to gain traction. Employment levels within our client base have remained stable.Small businesses, which are central to the U.S. economy, continue to show the resiliency. Our Small Business Employment Watch has shown that small businesses continue to add workers at sustained, but modest rates, also the trend in wages is showing some cooling in wage growth consistent with overall inflation. Our data indicate a continued stable macro-environment for small and mid-sized businesses. We continue to monitor our leading indicators and are prepared to take appropriate actions to navigate any changes. But again, at this time, we don't see any material change to the macro-environment. Small businesses have faced challenges getting access to capital and managing cash flows in this environment. This has continued to drive demand for our full-service Employee Retention Tax Credit Service.I know there's been some recent news of the IRS pause in ERTC processing in order for them to perform increased audits. This is not expected to have an impact on our ability to provide the service, though it may take longer for our clients to receive their funds.

I want to thank our over 16,000 global employees who consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. It's because of them that we are off to such a good start this fiscal year. I'll now turn it over to Bob Schrader to give you a brief update on our financial results for the first quarter. Bob?Bob Schrader: Yeah, thanks, John, and good morning. It's good to be here with you this morning, and I certainly look forward to working with each of you as we move forward. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements; obviously, those involve risk. And we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release and our investor presentation that will be posted later today. I'll start providing a summary of our first quarter results and I'm going to turn it over to Efrain, he'll give an update on our financial position and updated guidance for the year. Total revenue for the quarter increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $956 million, primarily driven by higher clients and client employees, product penetration, price realization and HR ancillary services.We continue to see increased attachment and demand for our HR Solutions, retirement, and time and attendance solutions. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $298 million, driven primarily by higher revenue per client and higher average worksite employees. As John mentioned, we definitely saw some positive momentum in the PEO in the first quarter as it relates to both sales activity in medical plan participation and attachment, those were obviously headwinds last year, and we are definitely seeing some positive signs as we move through the first quarter here. Interest on funds held for clients increased 83% to $33 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $750 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and investments that we've made into the business.Operating income increased 8% to $536 million, with an operating margin of 41.7%, that's a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior-year period. And diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.16 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% for the quarter to $1.14 per share. I'll now turn it over to Efrain to take you through our financial position and our updated guidance for the year.Efrain Rivera: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I start, just wanted to say thank you, John, for the generous words. It's been an absolute professional privilege and honor to have been with Paychex during all this time. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high quality cash and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments with more than $1.7 billion. Total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of August 21, 2023. Cash flows from operations were $656 million for the first quarter, was driven by net income and changes in working capital. There was some influence of timing there. It wasn't quite as strong as the percentages would indicate, but nonetheless, it was a very solid quarter.As you know, our earnings quality, which many -- some of you have pointed out, is among the best candidly in the entirety of the S&amp;P 500. In the first quarter, we acquired a small company that purchases outstanding accounts receivable of their customers under non-recourse arrangements. This acquisition is a good strategic fit with another business that we have called Paychex Advance, and that business purchases accounts receivable for temporary staffing clients. This acquisition will provide an opportunity for our small business clients to manage working capital challenges. As John alluded to earlier, we've seen over the last several years that access to financing is very important for small and medium-sized businesses. We think this plays well into our -- in our portfolio of businesses that we have.I'm very excited to have it. The acquisition, at this stage, is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial results this year. We paid a total of $322 million in dividends during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar, superb, amazing 47%. Now, let me turn to guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. I'm going to give you color on not only the full year, the first half and the second half, and we typically do that at this stage. As you noted, we have raised guidance for interest on funds held for clients and for adjusted EPS, but I want to go through a little bit of color as we go through to give you a sense of what our thinking is. Our current outlook is as follows: You saw that Management Solutions still expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%.PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients now, as I have mentioned, expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million, raised from our previous guide of $135 million to $145 million. And before I get the question, are we anticipated a range -- are we anticipating a range of additional increases, no, we are poised looking at what the Fed is doing just like everyone else is, but this is our best estimate of, at least some additional activity by the Fed, but not -- likely not contemplating all of it to the extent that the Fed does something now. We'll have a conversation later in the year. Maybe the Fed will decide that they actually do want to pause, but at this point, that's where we anticipate being.Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but now we think this is likely towards the high end of the range. So, operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million. The effective income tax expected to be in the range of $24 million to $25 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 9% to 11%, and this is raised from our previous guide of 9% to 10%. This full year outlook assumes current macroeconomic conditions, which has some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes and their impact on the economy. And I would just say, it's been almost -- I would say, at least six quarters where we keep saying, ""Hey, we don't know what's going to happen in the back half of the year and it could change our outlook."" I think John summarized it very well.At this point, things look pretty stable. So, we are feeling directionally more and more confident in the back half. Projecting the second half of the year, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 7% and operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I heard some comments after -- first -- when we released guidance that we have a ramp in the back half of the year. I wouldn't describe our current guidance as a significant ramp in the back half of the year. Obviously, there are differences in the back half of the year that we'll navigate through and talk to you, but the difference between first half and second half is not dramatic. Of course, all of these comments are subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We will update you again on the second quarter call.So, let me just repeat a couple of things to make sure. First half 2024 total revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%, operating margin in the range of 40% to 41%. And then, in the second half at this point, we anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 7%, operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I refer you to our investor slides on the website for additional information. Before handing things back over to John, I would just like to say that, I appreciate the relationship I've built with each of you during my time here at Paychex. We've had a long time together and it's time to hand the reins over to someone else who I think we'll do an even better job than I have. One of the things that strikes me during that entire time, and many of you have been here for the entire ride, I got a call and someone -- or I got note and someone said, ""Efrain you're making me old, because I've retired two CFOs at Paychex."" So, I think that's unfortunately true.We are all getting a little bit older. But one of the things that always strikes me is that we are covered by the best group of analysts in the business. I'd say that even though I have disagreed with some of you over the years and I still think you have us rated too low, but be that as it may, I can't argue with some of the things that you write. And in a separate note, I just want to say this, I've worked with Bob Schrader for many years, both here and prior to Paychex. I know that I'm leaving you in very capable hands. And I'm sure that Bob will do an even better job than the one that I do. And with that, let me turn it back to John.John Gibson: Well, thank you, Efrain. Before I open the call for questions, probably two things. One, we have a lot of people here and the last time Efrain did a great job of providing rules on questions, particularly on compound questions and multiple follow-ups. So, we could just follow the Efrain rule in honor of Efrain's retirement. I know he would greatly appreciate it, and maybe we can create a new tradition here. But no, feel free to answering your questions. But I would like to also add, make everyone aware, there's many ways you can learn more about Paychex, and really the amazing success stories and the impact that we are having on the world. We've recently launched a series of reports that you can find on our Investor page both our annual report, our ESG report and a new client impact report, and very shortly, you'll be seeing a new Investor Relations 101 Presentation that will be launched on the website prior to our Annual Meeting in the coming weeks.And again, I think these documents provide a lot more color and really a lot more insights of just how significant, how broad our products are, how big an impact we are having on our customers, how big an impact we are having on our employees, how and why Paychex is known as one of the most admired, most ethical and most innovative companies in the world, and I encourage you to check that out. So, with that advertisement of our Investor website, Shelby, you can now turn it over for questions.See also 15 Best US Cities for Public Transportation and 15 Countries That Have the Best Economy in Africa.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations to you, Efrain.Efrain Rivera: Thank you.Ramsey El-Assal: We will miss hearing your voice on these calls certainly. I was wondering if you could comment on the interest from corporate investments was relatively high in the first quarter, and it doesn't necessarily feel like that's going to flow through for -- to the full year guide in terms of maybe recurring each quarter. So, maybe if you could talk about that contribution to other income and just how you might see it trending the rest of the year?Efrain Rivera: Yeah. So, Ramsey, there's a couple of things that go into that line beyond just -- so for everyone who isn't focusing on that line that much. So that's a combination of our interest expense, our interest income from corporate portfolios primarily, and also some gains and losses on investments that we have in small investment fund that we have. Those things can swing a bit during the year and are subject to whatever we think the balance is going to be on corporate funds during the year. We made an acquisition, so we expect that. During the year, our average corporate balances will be lower. So that will generate lower interest income. And then, the other part of that, Ramsey, is gains and losses on that other investments as the mark-to-market can change from quarter-to-quarter.So, there could be a little bit of lumpiness in that number, but it might be a little bit different. I would say one other thing just by way of color on that line. We ended up with a fairly high cash balance that was influenced by timing. I think, I called that out,, or if I didn't, let me call it out now. It just really had to do with the day on which we closed the quarter so our cash balances were higher. They are likely to be a bit lower -- not a bit lower, but lower as we progress through the year. So, you might see that number change a bit.Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Fantastic. And a quick follow-up. If you could talk about SECURE Act 2.0? How you see that evolving? And how you see that potentially -- presumably benefiting the business over time?John Gibson: Yeah, look, SECURE Act 2.0, I think is a great action and great step that the government has taken is encouraging and helping small and mid-sized businesses, provide for the retirement of their employees. We are certainly out there educating the market on the opportunity. It really provides an opportunity for them to add a 401(k) plan or get a tax credit back for the implementation fees or the set-up fees of the plan. And then allows them to actually do a match for their employees and get that back into a tax credit as well. So, we are very happy our 401(k) business has continued -- has very, very strong growth, that has continued. The thing I continue to remind people, we have some experience in this in other state mandates and what we realized is that there's a lot of education that has to go on to get the market educated about the cost of a 401(k) plan, the benefits of a 401(k) plan.And certainly, we are out actively in the market, educating the market, educating our strategic partners on that, and we believe that the SECURE Act 2.0 is going to allow us to continue to sustain the double-digit growth rates that we've seen in the retirement business over the last several years.Ramsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Thank you very much.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.Daniel Maxwell: Hey, good morning, guys. This is Daniel Maxwell on for Andrew today. To start off, I was hoping you could dig in a little on any changes to the dynamic between ASO and PEO, and whether over the past couple of months, you've seen any preferences shift on that. You called it out the last couple of quarters, and I was wondering, if anything changed.John Gibson: Yeah. So, I would say this, we continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions across the board. And I would say that the balance is probably more back to prior to '23, where we saw a little shift to ASO. We've seen more of what -- more traditional balance of ASO to the PEO. As we mentioned on our last call, we've made some changes I think to our product portfolio in the PEO that I think is balanced that out a little bit. The other thing that I would point to that we mentioned on the prior call is that when we over-index with ASO in the prior year, we always look at that as a great opportunity for us to go back to those customers and then upgrade them or selective them into our PEOs product. And we started doing that.We actually -- that's a good example of AI, where we are actually using AI tools to be able to go into the ASO base and find clients that we believe there's going to be a valuable value proposition to be in the PEO relationship for multitude of different reasons, and that program actually has shown results in the first quarter. It's early in the process, but I would tell you that our transition of ASO to PEO customers, the number of customers that we transitioned this first quarter versus last first quarter was nearly 2x the number of clients. So, exactly what we thought could happen, which was we over-indexed when ASO in the prior fiscal year. We continue to sell outside to new logos and that was also double-digit strong in PEO in the first quarter.So, we have both benefits. We had strong outside the base growth in PEO in the first quarter, and we had good migration or upgrades ASO to PEO, which was a good start to the first quarter. We still got three quarters to go and we are in the middle of our open enrollment, which is critical there. But good early signs. We had good signs in the PEO in the fourth quarter, and we've talked about that on the last call, and that just accelerated in the first quarter. So, now we just got to see if that can continue into the core selling season.Daniel Maxwell: Great. Good to hear. And then for my follow-up, any detail you can give on the increase to the direct insurance costs from workers' comp? Any color or any reminder of your exposure to any volatility in that area?Bob Schrader: Yeah. This is Bob here. I mean, we, obviously, take risk in the PEO business on workers' comp. Obviously, we are very prudent in managing that risk in which -- and picking on which risk we are willing to take. I'd say there is growth in the quarter, primarily driven by, we have growth in worksite employees, that is going to drive higher workers' compensation costs. We go through every quarter and do true-ups of our reserves and so forth, but nothing specific to call out other than growth in the business that would drive growth in direct costs.John Gibson: Yeah. There has been no change to our underwriting standards. There's no change to our programs in terms of caps and limits, and there is no real change in the overall program performance.Daniel Maxwell: All right. Thanks a lot, guys, and congrats again to Efrain on your retirement and Bob on your promotion.Bob Schrader: Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.Bryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Efrain and Bob, let me echo my congrats as well. Efrain, it's been nice working with you here. Enjoy your retirement.Efrain Rivera: Thank you.Bryan Bergin: I got to ask the question because we've gotten a lot of question, just as it relates to ERTC. So, it doesn't sound like you have any change in your fiscal '24 revenue expectation there surrounding ERTC after this recent IRS announcement, but can you just dig in there a little bit more since there have been a lot of questions? Is there any evidence of any clients wanting to potentially delay submitting new claims there? Any dynamic there to be mindful of?John Gibson: Listen, Bryan, appreciate the question. Look, ERTC was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We continue to submit. No one is wanting to delay. The program is going to end. And, I -- again, the IRS announcement is not stopping anyone's efforts -- our efforts in approaching clients who are assisting and then filing the tax credits. And in fact, the IRS specifically commented to clients and small business owners that they should seek trusted partners to complete their filings. The IRS pause in processing that, and accepting. So they're accepting filings. It's really due to some just really bad actors out there that are providing bad advice to small businesses and putting them at risk. I talked about this probably a year ago when this started when these little pop-up companies started to show up.And again, I think the IRS is trying to do a prudent thing to tamp down on fraud and also to make sure these small businesses are not getting bad advice from these pop-up firms. So, we actually are continuing to accept and encouraging our clients and prospects to file, and we provide a service where we are confident that the advice we are giving them is adequate and we'll continue to try to get their processing done before the filing deadline early next calendar year. The delay impact for the client is really going to be in the processing, which is really going to be when they get the refund.Bryan Bergin: Okay. Very good. That's clear. And then, my follow-up, just on the target here. Can you share as it relates to the M&amp;A the financial profile of this target? Just any revenue attribution to call out now included in the current year outlook? I did hear you mentioned, I believe, the upper end of your growth range. But just wanted to confirm there were no organic offsets of that.Efrain Rivera: Organic offsets, which...Bryan Bergin: As far as anything in the organic side being offset by now any incremental inorganic in the year?Efrain Rivera: Not really, Bryan. I mean, it will contribute a modest amount of revenue, we'll call it out as we go through the year. But it's not masking something or additive in that respect. I think there's a number of different vectors of growth within the company that are working pretty well. So, no, not really.Bryan Bergin: All right. Thank you.Efrain Rivera: Yeah, you're welcome.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. And Bob and Efrain, congrats to both of you. Just on my question, I wanted to better understand the raising of the guidance and confidence in the back half. Is that both on Management Solution as well as PEO? Any color on that front? Thanks.Efrain Rivera: Yeah. So, one is, kind of, I'd say, process and structural, and then, the second is the substance of what we saw in the first half. So, the process and the substance is simply that, at a point in time you're taking a snapshot and saying, okay, when we issued the guidance back four months or so ago, we had a certain set of macro conditions. We didn't know of it, whether they would hold at that point. The macro conditions, as John said earlier, haven't changed significantly. So, we fast forward four months and now we have more certainty as to what environment we are looking at, at least in the medium-term. Medium-term being three to six months. So that's one. The second part is, we look at the trends in the business where we close, where we correct in terms of the trends that we saw.You heard some of the comments that John said on the PEO, so much of that was what we expected from an execution standpoint, but it's one thing to expect it, it's another thing to deliver it, and thus far we've started on a good note. So those are those are two parts of it. So, by the time we get to September and we are in the October now. We know with reasonable degree of certainty what Q2 looks now. We project forward into the back half of the year and do we feel reasonably confident based on the combination of all the factors that we are seeing at the back half expectations will be as we expect. As we sit here, the answer is yes. So, as you look at the guidance it anticipates that PEO will strengthen in the back half of the year. And at this point, we are seeing indications.Can we say that with certainty? You can never say anything certainly. But we -- based on all of that combination of factors, we feel pretty positive about where things are turning.John Gibson: Yeah, just to add on to that, I think, again, every business has -- we have a rhythm and the third quarter is a critical -- that's our selling season. And so, what the macroenvironment will be in the third quarter, fourth quarter, those are all the things we are trying to guess. I think what I would characterize it at this point in time is when we left the fourth quarter, I talked about the second half of our last fiscal year, we actually saw new sales bookings, both in Management Solutions and the PEO and Insurance accelerating. We continue to see that double-digit momentum in the first quarter, HR outsourcing, ASO and PEO, strong mid-market in the quarter, retirement is strong, digital payroll is strong. So, when we look at the demand environment, then we look at the employment environment with our index and what we are seeing the first quarter set-up to be kind of a repeat and continuation of what we saw in the second half and particularly the fourth quarter.Now as it relates to the PEO business as we talked about the insurance is a portion of that, insurance attachment is part of the reason why we have a little bit of a wider range. What you have to determine there is, how many companies continue to offer benefits to their employees? That's the first choice. The second choice is, how many of those employees sign up for Health Insurance, and what plans do they sign up for? Now, we are only a quarter way through that decision process, which really is already started, about 25% of the way through. What I would say at this 25% away, we are running a little bit on par, where we expected. I mean if that continues, I think that's what gives us confidence in the back half. But again, I still got three quarters of that process left and again, I want to be predictable relative to what we should expect.And so, we are being, I think prudently cautious in making sure that we are executing both Management Solutions, we are taking advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and then in the POE and Insurance, making sure we are doing what we need to do to make sure we have a successful open enrollment and drive insurance attachment.Ashish Sabadra: That's a great color. And maybe if I can just ask a quick follow-up question on the commentary on the PEO side on the improved insurance attach rate. Obviously, last quarter you had also talked about a leaner product and I was wondering if that's driving better adoption or you are seeing just better adopt -- demand or stronger demand for insurance product? Thanks.John Gibson: Yeah. So, I would say that there is a multitude of things that we probably tweaked every aspect of how we approach the insurance, both in terms of analytics of what we are doing relative to targeting customers that we think can drive -- we can drive value proposition there. We've changed the technology. We've changed our advisory approach, and we've expanded the products -- choices that both employers and employees can have. We've improved our educational tools in that process. We got a lot more engagement with our HR advisors, with clients around that. So, I would say, across the board after what we experienced a year ago in the first quarter, we've looked at every aspect of it and the team has really done a great job there and just re-imagining how we need to approach this.And again, we are only 25% of the way through, but we are seeing results from those activities. And, I do think demand for insurance, and I think it's going to be interesting. We were very pleased with our renewals. I mean, if you read in the general press right now, you will see that there is a degree of health inflation, and when that occurs, we do typically see more customers shopping for alternatives that we think we have a good value proposition there.Ashish Sabadra: That's a great color. Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.Scott Wurtzel: Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe just going back to the acquisition. I'm just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color on the strategic rationale behind it and sort of said another way, like why now with this deal, and maybe relative to some of the other targets that you were looking at? Thanks.Efrain Rivera: Well, I'll bracket it in three ways. The first thing is that, as John alluded to or said earlier, the ability for small businesses to access funding -- in small and medium size, I should say, access funding is important. So, we had our eyes on looking to build our capability in that area. The second thing is, acquisitions are, as you would know, they don't always present themselves with exactly the timing which you would expect them to, and when an opportunity arises and you do what you need to do to take advantage of it. We saw an opportunity for high-quality asset and decided that it was the right time. And I would say the third is that, it's an interesting environment for small businesses, so where access to funding opportunities is becoming more tricky given what has happened with banks and with rising interest rates.So, we think the timing seemed to fit pretty well. And again, I don't spend too much time. It's a relatively modest acquisition based on our revenue side, but we think we've had a lot of success with our Paychex Advance acquisition, and it's a very profitable corner of the market. And we think we can do the same thing with the company that we bought, called the [indiscernible] by the way.John Gibson: Yeah. And I would just add, neither one of these things are new to us. We kind of get dragged into this. When COVID hit, if you remember the PPP program and the banks were struggling to figure out how to access it, and we put a program together, and that started a partnership with several fintechs. We did both technology, integrations, et cetera, and that led to a more of a partnership approach. And then, we have several partners that if we have clients that meet our risk profile and are wanting to maybe need to fund the payroll or something like that, we've got partners that we can introduce them to. So, we got kind of introduced to this concept and certainly then the macroenvironment, what Efrain just said, banks, rising interest rates, and we just know we have a lot of great customers out there, small, mid-size customers are strong businesses that just really struggled to get access to capital at affordable rates.And so, that started just through a partnership piece. And then we had the Advance business, which was kind of doing this for staffing companies and we've been in that. It has been a great business for us. It's a great acquisition business for us. Introduced us as a payroll customer. There's just a lot of positives there. And those are adjacent. And so literally, it's one of those classic, you're at a conference and you know people who know people and the timing seemed right. And just based upon the need we saw and the fact that we thought there were opportunities for us to potentially help our strong customers continue to grow their business. We've already been introducing them to partners. Why not introduce them to ourselves and get a piece of that action?So that was kind of the strategic rationale. And it's a small, like you said, very small at this point in time.Scott Wurtzel: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up. I mean, just one quickly on the float portfolio. When we think about the recent Fed commentary and dot plot showing maybe a sustained higher rate trajectory than maybe we were expecting a few months ago. I'm afraid, I know you've talked about in the past wanting to position the portfolio more on longer duration securities. I was just wondering if this -- the recent Fed commentary sort of gears you even more towards sort of the longer duration securities in the portfolio rather than shorter duration? Thanks.Efrain Rivera: Yeah. We are reviewing monthly to figure out based on and looking at the same dot plots you are to see what happens. I would just go back to something I've said from the point that the Fed started raising rates. The problem isn't taking advantage of the rates going up, the problem is what happens when it comes down. And so, we are positioning the portfolio, we will position the portfolio, and I'm sure Bob will do the same, to be able to manage it in an orderly way on the way down. So, we are looking at -- this is a time when you want to go longer, if you can, even if perhaps there are opportunities on the short-end of the curve, because at some point, it will come up, and that's what you got to figure out how best to manage, and that's what we are working on.Scott Wurtzel: Great. Thank you, and congrats, Efrain.Efrain Rivera: Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.Efrain Rivera: Hi, Tien-Tsin.Tien-Tsin Huang: Hey, good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the acquisition, the $200 million acquisition here, and the strategic fit with Paychex Advance. I remember when that deal was announced and there was a lot about payroll funding and factoring and whatnot. Is this now more about early wage access and some of the more modern funding opportunities for employees? Just want to make sure I understand what you're adding specifically here.Efrain Rivera: Yeah, the short answer is no. So that's a separate initiative. At some point, we'll talk about when it becomes more significant. Now, Tien-Tsin, this what they do is more focused on receivable. So, obviously, we dipped our toe in the water with staffing firms, but we saw an opportunity that broader than that, because our -- all of our clients have to one degree or another, receivables, and it can become a source of financing. And we've got the data to make it work.Tien-Tsin Huang: Okay, very clear. So, this is an AR opportunity?Efrain Rivera: Yeah.Tien-Tsin Huang: Understood, okay. No follow-up for me. Just want to wish you, Efrain, all the best, of course, for the next chapter. And I've said it before, you've been really helpful for us for a long time. So, thanks for that. I definitely going to miss talking to you.Efrain Rivera: Thanks, Tien-Tsin.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. Your line is open.Peter Christiansen: Good morning. Welcome, and congrats to Bob, and certainly congrats and thank you to Efrain. John, I wanted to dig a little bit into your thoughts on SMB lending in general. Obviously, this news of big money center bank is getting into the payroll business a bit more and SMB lending is often thought as a nice adjacency here. Should we consider the possibility that Paychex may further delve into SMB lending, whether it would be merchant cash advances or other types of working capital solutions? You see that in Paychex's future?John Gibson: No, well look, I think what we are trying to do is make sure that we are focused on what do we need to do to help our clients succeed. And as I said, whether that's through partnership or if there's opportunities for us to participate in that process integrating that with our technology, those are really the things that we are interested in. And when we hear our clients, and we are engaging those clients through our advisors on a constant basis, say, this is an issue for them, we go and search for answers, and partnerships are part of that. And as I said, we have several partnerships with fintechs that we are doing and relationships with large banks. I can go deeper on that if you want to know about banking and banks and payroll.We do -- we have businesses that do that. But I think, in general, you should not read anything more into this than the fact there is a need out there that we had an adjacent business that has been very successfully managed and has been a good return for our shareholders. And there was a natural relationship and opportunity that we thought by us coming in with our balance sheet, with our expertise, with our client base, that we could potentially make something of this. And so, I don't think you should read anything more into it than opportunistic acquisition that matches a need that we are seeing today from our customers, and one that based upon the macroenvironment, we think we are going to grow. And I don't think this is competition with any of the major banks.Most of these clients are just not getting access to the funds. It's just not available. And if there's more tightening at the regional bank, which is generally the go-to place for small and medium-sized businesses, that's not good for small business owners. And so, we are going to try to figure out how we can build partnerships to do that.Peter Christiansen: Well, thank you. That's super helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just wondering if you could call out any trends balance of trade-wise, are there areas where you see Paychex has an opportunity to improve the competitive dynamics or vice versa some areas where you're a bit more on defense versus offense? Just any sense on balance of trade versus some of your competitors and maybe some of the regionals as well?John Gibson: Well, I'll just say this, as we've talked about our sales momentum continues in the first quarter that we saw in the second quarter, on the macro side, when I'm looking at it, I'm not seeing any major shifts at all relative to balancing trade in the competitive environment. I commented on the fourth quarter. When I do look under it, again, these things go back and forth. I would say, it's raining a little more in our favor on the competitive front in several key areas that we monitor. We had a good first quarter in the mid-market. That was -- there were several good signs there as well, but it's not monumental. It's the same market, very stable competitive environment. Same set of competitors, low-end, mid, high-end PEO. It's the same cast of characters, same kind of pricing environment, competitive environment. It's a competitive marketplace. We'll leave it at that, and I think we are winning more than our fair share.Peter Christiansen: Yeah, for sure. Thanks again, and congrats, Efrain. Good luck.Efrain Rivera: Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Efrain Rivera: Hey, Bryan.Bryan Keane: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about the free cash flow increase year-over-year in the first quarter, it was substantial. I think it was up over 23%. How much of that was that one-time in working capital? And how much should that carry through the fiscal year? Or should we see a decreasing kind of growth rate in free cash flow to equal out the same growth of the 9% to 11% earnings growth by the time we get to the end of the fiscal year?Bob Schrader: Yeah, Bryan, this is Bob. I mean I think that's a fair way to think about it. I think as you guys know, we typically don't have big swings in our working capital. And as Efrain mentioned, we had a little bit of a timing there at the end of quarter. The quarter ended on a big collection day, so we had a big influx of cash that would go out the next day. So, the way to really think about our operating cash flows and then, obviously, free cash flow gets impacted by M&amp;A. So, there was a little bit of an impact there in Q1 to free cash flows. But typically, our operating cash flows growth is going to trend in line with our net income growth. And so, you'll see that moderate as we move through the year and that's what you should expect from a growth standpoint.Bryan Keane: Got it. And then just a follow-up. I was hoping to get an update on what you guys are seeing for SMB bankruptcy rates. I know they have been a little bit elevated in the recent past here. And just curious if that's still at elevated levels or is it become more normalized?John Gibson: Yeah, no -- so, when we say elevated, I think that they are elevated over what we saw during the COVID period that's two, two-and-a-half years. Actually, bankruptcies are still slightly below where they were pre-pandemic and kind of trending toward a normalized rate. We have seen that. I would say, particularly in the start-up businesses when we had the big start-up boom, we've seen a lot more out of businesses on the very small -- I think we called that out in our press release. Revenue retention at near-record levels, and when you look at our HR outsourcing businesses at record levels. So that's what we've kind of seen on the bankruptcy side. The other interesting stat related to bankruptcy that kind of surprised me in the first quarter is we actually saw an uptick in new business starts.And again, we had this big elevated area and then we kind of gravitated back down towards kind of normal levels. And we actually saw in the first quarter new business starts click up, which was interesting.Bryan Keane: Got it. Great. And Efrain, it's been a real pleasure working with you. You'll be missed.Efrain Rivera: Thank you, Bryan. Appreciate it.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.Samad Samana: Great. Thank you. Efrain, I'll echo, missing working with you and enjoy a well-deserved retirement, sir. Appreciate all the help over the years.Efrain Rivera: Appreciate it.Samad Samana: Maybe just a quick one for me. A lot of the questions have been asked. But just how are you guys seeing the top of the funnel in terms of inbound leads, the digital channel? Any change in maybe interest levels, registrations for webinars, just anything that we can look look at as a leading indicator of bookings? And how has that trended maybe in first quarter?John Gibson: Again, I'll go back, if our sales are growing at double-digit rates in the first quarter, digital is an ever-growing portion of that business where you can surmise that that's growing as well. So, we continue to see strong demand environment across the businesses, both digitally and really across the board, I wouldn't -- that's about it.Samad Samana: Great. And then maybe just on your own hiring plans with the quarter doing better than expected and maybe some trends you're seeing, any change to your own sales hiring plans or should we expect maybe the original game plan to be here?John Gibson: No, really no change in plans. We are certainly, in the second quarter, always in the staffing up and making sure we are fully staffed and able to cover any thought or planned attrition going in for the selling season, both on the service side and the sell-side. So, I think it's fair to say when you add now going on close to three quarters of strong demand, when you've been relatively, is it going to stay, is going to stay, yeah, we certainly want to make sure that we are properly staffed to take full advantage of all the opportunity in our selling season and we are fully staffed on the operations on the service side to make sure that we can both onboard and service these clients during year-end.Samad Samana: Great. Appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you.Efrain Rivera: Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Eugene Simuni with Moffettnathanson. Your line is open.Eugene Simuni: Thank you. Good morning, guys, and congratulations, Efrain and Bob.Efrain Rivera: Thank you, Eugene.Eugene Simuni: Efrain, we will miss working with you, and Bob look forward to working with you. Just have two quick follow-ups. One tying together your comments on sales and current, can you comment how it adds together to client growth trends this year so far? Last year, it was a bit below your historical target range and I think you commented that last quarter that this year you're looking for a reacceleration in client growth kind of above 2% a year. So, can you comment on how it's going so far?Efrain Rivera: Hey, Eugene, I'll start, then John [can make a comment] (ph). It really -- if I were to give you a number, it would give you some sort of false sense of what reality is. It's almost impossible to draw a conclusion on that where you are in first quarter. In some ways, some trends are positive and you can draw conclusions on project out through the year, but client base is really a tricky one. And the reason is you just lose so many and gain so many in the selling season that it's almost difficult to predict and we expect to be a bit better than we were last year, but it's still early innings.Eugene Simuni: Got it. Okay. And then, another follow-up is on the PEO and the question there is, in your PEO customer base, in terms of kind of checks per control, are you seeing any trends that are different from your overall base whether better or worse employment growth?John Gibson: Yeah, I would say it's probably consistent. We definitely see employees in our PEO -- clients in our PEO business adding employees. I wouldn't say it's a huge tailwind, but it's positive and probably in-line with what we are seeing in other areas of the business.Eugene Simuni: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.Efrain Rivera: Thank you.Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.Mark Marcon: Hey, good morning. Hey, Efrain, we go back a long way as it's been an absolute pleasure working with you.Efrain Rivera: Same here.Mark Marcon: I want to thank you for the relationship. And Bob, looking forward to working with you, but Efrain, it's been an absolute pleasure.Efrain Rivera: Thank you.Mark Marcon: A lot of questions have been on the short term. John, one big-picture question. A quarter ago everybody was asking about AI. Obviously, you've been -- Paychex has been doing a lot with AI for a long period of time. I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about -- now that some of these LLMs have been around for a couple of quarters and permeated the consciousness, how are you thinking about further evolution of your journey with AI? And what are the longer-term implications from a margin perspective or a scope of business perspective?John Gibson: Wow, that's -- Mark, that is a big question.Mark Marcon: Well, everybody is asking about the quarter...John Gibson: Yes, it is a great one, because I really think this is probably has the potential to be one of the biggest differentiators that's going to help company like Paychex, separate ourselves from the rest. Because as you said, the large language models, it starts with a large, and the only way that this works is you've got to have large sets of data and large sets of data coming through to continually train those models. I will also say relative to, it's expensive to do, and it's getting more expensive both in terms of finding the people and buying the technology, and I think that's going to also back some people out. But let me just give you some idea. I mean, we have multiple teams across the organization looking at every aspect of our business, front-office, back-office, G&amp;A and evaluating how we could better leverage all of the capabilities of the data that we have.So, think of it today we are recording 6.5 million calls with our clients. This year, we are transcribing those call. We are using analytics to determine whether or not we have a service opportunity, or if we have a sales opportunity or an upsell opportunity in the conversations that we are having with our advisors. We are already doing almost 1 million natural language processing and analysis on our sales conversations with prospects looking for what are the right phrases, words, markets, segments where we are winning. And then adjusting that overnight and changing our sales play the next morning. Using some of that in our PEO, we've nearly doubled our close rates in the first quarter. I mean, I just could go on and on about where we are piloting and testing and using our data to do this.And so, I think there are tremendous opportunities. And then, when you begin to productize this and start thinking about the value that we can provide, the Retention Insights, which we launched, I keep bringing this up. We launched this a year-and-a-half ago. We won an award for AI and I think at the time, no one even wrote anything much about it. And because I don't think any people knew what AI was. And quite frankly it's -- I think that's just one example of multiple examples we are going to be able to drive more value to customers. And so, I think we are going to be able to go with a value proposition. And to be fair, there's other large competitors that probably are going to make similar claims, but I certainly think it's a differentiator.If you run a local payroll company, you're not going to have the same data and the insights that Paychex has relative to what's going on in your area, what's going on in the labor market. And if we can harness that and use technology to deliver that to our salespeople, our service people and our HR advisors, I think the trusted advisor position that we've already established ourselves for small and medium-sized businesses, it's only going to be further sustained and probably increase. So, I think Bob is going to -- has given me the hook to get off the bandwagon. [indiscernible]Mark Marcon: And then for my follow-up, just a quick question. Just in terms of the margin uplift from the first half to the second half, aside from normal seasonality and obviously float balances, certain forms of processing, is there anything to call out above and beyond that? Is it just pace of investments in the first half being a little bit front-end loaded?Efrain Rivera: Yeah, I think that's it. Mark, it's a couple of things. One is, we -- have you noticed the pattern in P&amp;L, pretty obvious, we have attended to front-load a little bit more of spending, in part to make sure that we are prepared for selling season and then as we get into the fourth quarter typically we have heavied up our spending and anticipating -- in anticipation of starting the year stronger. Q3, as you know, because you could have that influx of annual processing, generally makes Q3 margins higher and then in Q4, I don't anticipate it would be quite as heavy as it has been in prior years when you combine those two, you get a little bit more spending in the first half, a little bit less in the back half, but more revenue in the back half, [indiscernible] margin uplift that I mentioned. There's nothing unusual about it. It's just the way that revenue and expenses flow through.Mark Marcon: Terrific. Thanks again, Efrain. I'll miss working with you.Efrain Rivera: Yeah, thank you.Operator: And we'll take our last question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.James Faucette: Thank you very much. And I want to share my congratulations to Bob and Efrain. Just wanted to quick follow-up question here on PEO, and you had mentioned some of your customers, and I think you've kind of talked about this and had pulled back on providing ancillary services like insurance and 401(k), et cetera. But now you're calling out some growth in those same ancillary services as the driver of PEO growth in the quarter. What are the things that you're watching for to gauge like the durability of that improvement and kind of response by your customers and employers?Efrain Rivera: So, James, you mean, what are we looking at...James Faucette: Yeah, like what are the things in a more macroeconomy or even in your customer behavior to try to gauge and project the durability of that improvement?Efrain Rivera: Well, let me start, and then John and maybe Bob can weigh in. So, I just want to make sure that I'm answering the question correctly. I think the key thing in -- if you step back on the PEO is, we saw that attachment last year where we expected it to be. And also we saw an opportunity to tilt the balance a bit between what was an ASO sale versus a PEO sale. So, what we are looking at, at least to start the year is, first, are we positioned appropriately on the insurance side to be able to take advantage of that, and create momentum as we go into some key points in the year which occur in the fall and then at the beginning of the year on insurance and attachment. But one thing, James, that's important to point out, last year, when we were talking at this point, we were seeing actually something unusual where we are seeing clients dropping insurance and actually lowering their attachment -- I'm sorry, not their attachment, their enrollment.So, we haven't seen that start of the year. So, the absence of a negative is a positive. So, I think -- that's one piece. And John called out something, I think, that is important, also that balance between what we are seeing on ASO and PEO that seems to kind of come into a little bit more in balance. So, I think those two things bode -- or have started the year well. And...John Gibson: Yeah, no, I'm trying to understand. So, remember, we've got -- you've got existing client behavior, particularly as it relates to attachment, and again, it's always difficult because the insurance it's pass-through, it doesn't have a huge impact on margin as an oversized impact on the revenue numbers right, because is that the way it works. And so you had two dynamics. One was existing customers that have the product, are they continuing to want that attachment? And then, what are they attaching on? Are they attaching the catalog plan or the basic low value plan? That's the first decision. And last year, we had something we normally don't see, and we have not seen thus far through our enrollment of people, as Efrain said, instead of going to a lower plan, dropping and not offering.We're not seeing that behavior, we saw that last year. We saw less people opting to want to add that or seeing value in adding the insurance, but they wanted the HR, and they wanted the technology, and they wanted our advisory services. They went in the ASO buckets. Now we are going back to some of them that are now saying okay wait, now I do want to add the insurance, and now we are upgrading them to the PEO offering. So, what we are seeing is, both in terms of new logo demand, some new net customers to Paychex, we are seeing strong demand in our ASO and PEO market with attachment rates in the PEO similar to what we saw prior to the '23 experience. And then, the third thing that we've got going on is we are going back into this ASO group of clients that we were -- last year, and we are going back and using analytics and using value propositions to see if we can go back and have some of those clients upgrade and add insurance as part of their value proposition.I hope that answers your question. I wasn't clear, James...James Faucette: That's actually really helpful. And I guess just as -- so it sounds like for most of your employers in terms of their behavior on particularly some of those offerings is that they're kind of reverting back to what you would expect to be in a normalized environment, and really it was last year that was really atypical.John Gibson: Yes, that's what I would say it. Again, you just make stuff out. I was just trying to remember two years ago was the great resignation. Last year this time, the bottom was going to fall out of the economy and all is the recession was right around the corner. They are going to recall that. I mean, it's just -- it's been a very emotional roller coaster ride for small and medium-sized businesses. And when they're making a decision of this magnitude because you're making a commitment to your employees that you're going to offer a benefit and the expectation is you're baking that into your business model going forward. And so, I think there was a lot of hesitancy. Now, does that mean small, medium-sized businesses are more confident today than they were last year?I don't know, but what I can tell you is we are seeing more behavior that is similar to what we've seen in historical patterns. And last year, it seemed to be an anomaly. Again, I'm only 25% through the enrollment, but what I'm seeing right now we'll know more in the next call. Let's leave it at that.James Faucette: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys.Efrain Rivera: Appreciate it.John Gibson: Okay. Shelby, I think that wraps it up. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call that will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, that's on the Paychex Investor website, where we also have all these fabulous reports for you to read. And again, we want to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope everyone has a great day.Operator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. At the start of the year, there was a lot of excitement surrounding tech stocks. However, as investor sentiment shifted, other types of investments gained attention. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell by 5.32% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date returns to 27.09%, as of September 28. During uncertain times, investors prefer dependable stocks to earn a steady income and maintain their financial stability.Dividend stocks are often considered relatively stable investments compared to some other types of stocks, particularly those that do not pay dividends. When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn their attention to companies that regularly grow their dividends. Steady and consistent dividend increases indicate that a company is financially strong. This can also assist investors in creating a portfolio that consistently generates high dividend income over time. In our article titled 14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now, we referred to Hartford Funds data and mentioned that companies that either raised or started paying dividends since 1973 have achieved the best returns compared to other stocks. These returns were achieved with less price fluctuations. During this time, dividend growers and initiators provided a 10.24% return, while companies that reduced dividends returned 3.95% to shareholders.Dividend stocks can provide income even when the broader stock market is experiencing declines, which can help investors ride out challenging market conditions. In addition to this, these equities, especially those from established companies, tend to have lower volatility compared to growth stocks, which can experience more significant price swings. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, during the 1970s, a period known for both high inflation and sluggish economic growth, dividends accounted for 70% of the overall returns investors earned. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade in which total returns were negative. Dividend returns of nearly 2% helped offset the negative price returns caused by events like the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis, providing a cushion for investors.Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowWhile dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, have not performed as well as the overall market this year, analysts are optimistic about the potential for these stocks to perform better in the remaining part of the year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”11.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230928729438/en/Chris Church (Photo: Business Wire)""Chris has had an unblinking commitment to operational excellence over his years of leadership experience in the nuclear industry, including his time at Xcel Energy,"" said Tim O’Connor, Xcel Energy executive vice president and chief operations officer. ""This experience makes him supremely well qualified to build on our track record as an experienced operator of carbon-free, always-on nuclear power plants.""The strong performance of Xcel Energy’s fleet at Monticello and Prairie Island is a key factor helping the company cut carbon emissions by 53% from 2005 levels. The Monticello and Prairie Island plants provide about 30% of the power the company supplies to customers in the Upper Midwest. Because nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity around the clock, they complement wind and solar resources while providing hundreds of good-paying jobs in their local communities.Church has served as vice president of nuclear operations since 2020 and was site vice president at the Monticello plant for two years before that. Prior to joining Xcel Energy, he held several senior leadership roles in other nuclear fleets, including vice president of operations support for Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and site vice president of that company’s Watts Bar and Sequoyah nuclear power plants. He was previously a submarine officer in the United States Navy.""Excellence in nuclear energy generation is a job that’s never finished,"" Church said. ""I’m proud of our nuclear team’s performance, which positions our Monticello and Prairie Island plants as a foundation of the company’s future and Minnesota’s clean energy goals.""Story continuesGardner is retiring after nearly 40 years in the nuclear industry, including 10 years at Xcel Energy, and he provided steady leadership of the company’s nuclear fleet during the COVID-19 pandemic. Operational innovations during his tenure include a process for flexing down nuclear generation when low-cost wind resources are abundant and a forthcoming hydrogen demonstration project at Prairie Island. Xcel Energy’s nuclear fleet continues to be recognized for sustained exemplary performance by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations while achieving a 35% reduction in operational costs over the past 10 years.""In his time with the company, Pete helped transform the Xcel Energy nuclear fleet into one of the best in the country, with a focus on reliable operations and a forward-thinking vision,"" O’Connor said. ""The performance of our nuclear fleet under his leadership has positioned Pete’s legacy as one that will enable a bright future for nuclear power in Minnesota.""Recognizing the important role of nuclear energy in the state’s goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission recently unanimously approved the Monticello plant for an additional 10 more years of operations. Xcel Energy has also received stakeholder support for a future extension of the Prairie Island plant’s operating life.Learn more about Xcel Energy’s nuclear generating plants here.About Xcel EnergyXcel Energy (NASDAQ: XEL) provides the energy that powers millions of homes and businesses across eight Western and Midwestern states.

Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) ValuationHost Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) appears to be significantly undervalued based on the GF Value.

HOLX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of the Breast Health division’s portfolio of products and services. The company’s international business has been impressive, having grown 20.9% in the last reported fiscal 2023 third quarter. A highly solvent balance sheet further raises investors’ optimism.Meanwhile, lower COVID-19 testing revenues in the remaining quarters are likely to pose a headwind to the company’s margins. HOLX’s operations are subjected to macroeconomic uncertainties, which remain a cause of concern.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 6.5% compared with the 2% growth of the industry and a 17.6% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $17.12 billion. Hologic surpassed earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 19.32%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayStrength in Breast Health: Hologic has been making impressive progress in its Breast Health segment recently, leveraging its strategic expansion efforts to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Breast Health arm registered strong growth, primarily driven by the increased volumes of digital mammography systems, primarily 3D Dimension systems, and related workstation and workflow products, including software.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, increased Trident system unit sales and higher Faxitron breast-conserving surgery products aided growth. The company is also witnessing increased sales of its interventional breast solution products, driven by Brevera systems and related needles. In breast service, Hologic’s business continues to grow and is becoming an even larger part of the division's mix.Focus on International Operations: Hologic makes significant efforts to enter new geographies as many of the company’s best-in-class products command a leading share in the domestic market. HOLX’s international sales have been a major catalyst in the past few years, with the major driver being the molecular diagnostics business. The progress in terms of the placement of Panther instruments worldwide has been highly promising.Story continuesFurther, Hologic continues to witness the encouraging uptake of its assays like vaginitis panel and virals and tremendous international expansion opportunities. Hologic is also making efforts to expand internationally in breast health, with a focus on gaining market share with the existing 3D and upgradable 2D mammography products, the same products that have established leadership positions in the United States.Strong Solvency &amp; Capital Structure: At the end of the fiscal 2023 third quarter, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $2.77 billion and short-term payable debt of $32 million on its balance sheet. This can be treated as an upside for the company amid the ongoing economic downturn as it holds sufficient cash for debt repayment.The total long-term debt (including the current portion) of $2.79 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter remained sequentially unchanged.DownsidesLower COVID-19 Sales Hamper Growth: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, Hologic launched several assays to detect COVID-19. However, the company is experiencing a continuous decline in COVID-19 testing-related demand and is expected to continue at much lower levels in 2023 as customer testing and therapy and vaccine demand decline.In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, COVID-19 revenues, which consist of COVID-19 assay revenues and other COVID-19 related revenues and revenues from discontinued products, decreased (74.6%) or (74.4%) in constant currency.Macroeconomic Concerns: Hologic’s business and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and the availability of capital markets. Uncertainty about global economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets and countries with government-sponsored healthcare systems, may also cause decreased demand for products and services and increased competition, which could result in lower sales volumes.Estimate TrendsIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s fiscal 2023 earnings has remained constant at $3.92 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOLX’s fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.03 billion, suggesting a 17.2% fall from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Intuitive Surgical ISRG and Quanterix QTRX.Haemonetics has an estimated earnings growth rate of 26.1% in fiscal 2024 compared with the industry’s 18.7%. HAE’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.39%. Its shares have rallied 19.3% against the industry’s 1.8% fall in the past year.HAE carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Intuitive Surgical, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 15.7% compared with the industry’s 15.5%. Shares of the company have rallied 54.1% compared with the industry’s 1.9% growth over the past year.ISRG’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 4.19%.Quanterix, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated earnings growth rate of 62.8% for the current year compared with the industry’s 15.2%.

Oil prices climbing toward $100 a barrel has also weighed on the minds of the bulls.Read more: How a government shutdown would impact your money: Student loans, Social Security, investments, and moreThe sour mood has hurt the likes of big-cap tech names such as Netflix (NFLX), with shares off by 15% in the past three weeks (down 13% in the month). Apple (AAPL) has lost 9.8% in the face of positive reads on new iPhone demand. Even Salesforce (CRM) has pulled back by 8% despite the unveiling of cool new AI tools at the company's Dreamforce conference.Bottom line: Sentiment isn't good!""I think it's all coming home to roost as investors realize that the Fed does not have this under control and that the economy is struggling,"" Kace Capital Advisors managing partner Kenny Polcari told Yahoo Finance.Polcari makes a good point that there is a lot of ""stuff"" coming home to roost. Just take a look at some of the things we have seen this week in markets:Target is closing nine stores, citing rising retail crime. Certainly, there is an economic message or two there.Costco said on its earnings call that it’s not seeing a ""dramatic"" pick-up in thefts (hard to thieve and carry out a 25-pack of paper towels from Costco), which means they are seeing some form of theft pick-up.Consumer confidence hit a four-month low.New data on housing showed home purchases fell.H&amp;M warned about a sales plunge in September, blaming warm weather in Europe for delaying purchases of winter clothes. But hey, my H&amp;M store at Roosevelt Field in New York has been a little empty on the weekend too.BofA warned this week about rising credit delinquencies hitting retailers, with specific concerns cited for Kohl's and Nordstrom.Used car retailer CarMax had a dreadful quarter, with execs blaming rising interest rates for consumers delaying auto purchases. The company also saw a year-over-year pickup in credit losses.Story continuesThat’s a ton of signals that point to growing economic stress that the market likely hasn't adjusted for yet.Are we witnessing the lagged effects of Fed policy? Probably. Are households really feeling that inflation is slowing? Probably not. If people aren’t buying homes or used cars because of higher interest rates, is that a problem for stocks? Yes, it should be.Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsA brown bear inspects a pumpkin in its enclosure at Pairi Daiza animal park in Brugelette on Oct. 30, 2020.

He believes the streaming giant's stock remains positive overall but has concerns that page-sharing is being-- is less impactful than expected. And really interesting note here from the folks at JP Morgan, Brad.But I really-- you really have to start with the fact that Netflix shares down about 14% over the past two weeks. S&amp;P 500 down about, let's say, 4.5%. There's concern going into this Netflix [? call ?] that all the hype around all of the changes, the password crackdown, the pay-- the move to put ads on the platform, it may just be a big fat dud in terms of profits, whether that is operating profits or net profits.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, some of the key takeaways from this. As a result, their 2024 and 2025 estimates, they come down for revenue by about 2% to 3%, for operating income by about 5% to 6%. And as you're continuing to really evaluate what they're looking towards-- and some of this has come forward during their trending report earlier this month, but particularly remaining overweight here but lowering the December 2024 price target to $455 based on about 24.5 times the free cash flow for the end of 2025 of $8.1 billion.So all of this considered, I think, as you're looking across the continued impact because of the crackdown on page-sharing through Q3, mobile usage, and certain other sharing instances, suggesting the company can continue to tighten up page-sharing going forward is what they're writing here, but advertising remains the crawl phase here.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: I like that. It's pretty good.BRAD SMITH: Crawl?BRIAN SOZZI: Crawl phase. And-- but you go down to this bottom of this report, Brad, and it is-- certainly there's concern about the near term outlook for a [? company ?] Netflix. But under the investment thesis section, we believe Netflix is a key beneficiary and driver of the ongoing disruption of linear TV. And I think that is an important longer term consideration not only Netflix but, of course, names of like Roku because look what we're seeing out of Disney, Brad.Here is a Disney under Bob Iger still trying to-- they're flailing around, trying to figure out what to do with their TV assets, and he pulled the trigger on that ABC. He worked at ABC. He understands ABC. That is Bob Iger. So to see Bob Iger out there reportedly shopping those ABC assets, wow, it just tells you that the push to streaming remains not only alive and well, it continues to accelerate and drive a lot of disruption.BRAD SMITH: Well, you know, one company or one platform that would certainly want for there to not be-- at least as we think about where Netflix has lagged in some of the live element or sports element, they've certainly leaned into some of the nonscripted television most recently. I mean, ""Love is Blind"" is back for, what, a fifth season?BRIAN SOZZI: I never saw it.BRAD SMITH: We just saw the ads behind us in Times Square yesterday. And I didn't know that we were at season five of ""Love Is Blind"" already. So I'm excited. But it's the trash TV that they've been able to bring on and get people like Brian Sozzi to stay on the platform.BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, come on. He's going to call me out.BRAD SMITH: I won't tell them which show you watch. You can tell them that for yourself.BRIAN SOZZI: Please don't. I will just add this very quickly. I understand the near-term concern on Netflix, but that bidding between Comcast and Disney-- and the FT really broke it down earlier in the week-- that has begun for that Hulu asset. Some of the valuations being talked about potentially for Hulu are pretty mind-blowing. It's unclear ultimately how much Disney will pay for that asset, but something like that, if a big number does come through and Disney puts out a lot of money for Hulu, that could actually boost Netflix's stock.]"

Getting these DVDs has been part of my routine for decades.”Some of the remaining DVD diehards will get up to 10 discs as a going away present to loyal customers such as Konkle, 41, who has watched more than 900 titles since signing up for the service in 2006. In hopes of being picked for the 10 DVD giveaway, Konkle set up her queue to highlight for more movies starring Brando and older films that are difficult to find on streaming.At its peak, the DVD boasted more than 20 million subscribers who could choose from more than 100,000 titles stocked in the Netflix library. But in 2011, Netflix made the pivotal decision to separate the DVD side business from a streaming business that now boasts 238 million worldwide subscribers and generated $31.5 billion in revenue year.The DVD service, in contrast, brought in just $146 million in revenue last year, making its eventual closure inevitable against a backdrop of stiffening competition in video streaming that has forced Netflix to whittle expenses to boost its profits.“It is very bittersweet,” said Marc Randolph, Netflix's CEO when the company shipped its first DVD, ""Beetlejuice,"" in April 1998. “We knew this day was coming, but the miraculous thing is that it didn’t come 15 years ago.”Story continuesAlthough he hasn't been involved in Netflix's day-to-day operations for 20 years, Randolph came up with the idea for a DVD-by-service in 1997 with his friend and fellow entrepreneur, Reed Hastings, who eventually succeeded him as CEO — a job Hastings held until stepping aside earlier this year.Back when Randolph and Hastings were mulling the concept, the DVD format was such a nascent technology that there were only about 300 titles available at the time.In 1997, DVDs were so hard to find that when they decided to test whether a disc could make it thorough the U.S. Postal Service that Randolph wound up slipping a CD containing Patsy Cline's greatest hits into a pink envelope and dropping it in the mail to Hastings from the Santa Cruz, California, post office.Randolph paid just 32 cents for the stamp to mail that CD, less than half the current cost of 66 cents for a first-class stamp.Netflix quickly built a base of loyal movie fans while relying on a then-novel monthly subscription model that allowed customers to keep discs for as long as they wanted without facing the late fees that Blockbuster imposed for tardy returns. Renting DVDs through the mail became so popular that Netflix once ranked as the U.S. Postal Service's fifth largest customer while mailing millions of discs each week from nearly 60 U.S. distribution centers at its peak.Along the way, the red-and-white envelopes that delivered the DVDs to subscribers' homes became an eagerly anticipated piece of mail that turned enjoying a “Netflix night” into a cultural phenomenon. The DVD service also spelled the end of Blockbuster, which went bankrupt in 2010 after its management turned down an opportunity to buy Netflix instead of trying to compete against it.Even as video streaming boomed, movie lovers like Michael Fusco stuck with the DVD service because it still offered films that were no longer shown in theaters and couldn't easily be found in stores. When Netflix announced its intention to close the DVD service five months ago, Fusco expanded his subscription plan so he could rent as many as eight discs at a time at a cost of $56 a month.Fusco, 36, got his money's worth, especially in August when he watched 32 DVDs sent to him by Netflix.“I was very strategic,” said Fusco, who also thought carefully about what films to pick as his final selections after watching more than 2,400 titles during his 18 years as subscriber. The Southern California resident is now awaiting a Spanish comedy, “Solo Con Tu Pareja,” as his final disc and also set up his queue to highlight films by Harrison Ford (""Mosquito Coast""), Tom Hanks (""Joe Versus The Volcano"") and Arnold Schwarzenegger (""Twins"") should he be among those picked for the final 10-disc giveaway.Randolph and Hastings always planned on video streaming rendering the DVD-by-mail service obsolescent once technology advanced to the point that watching movies and TV shows through internet connections became viable. That expectation is one of the reasons they settled on Netflix as the service's name instead of other monikers that were considered, such as CinemaCenter, Fastforward, NowShowing and DirectPix (the DVD service was dubbed “Kibble,” during a six-month testing period)“From Day One, we knew that DVDs would go away, that this was transitory step,"" Randolph said. “And the DVD service did that job miraculously well. It was like an unsung booster rocket that got Netflix into orbit and then dropped back to earth after 25 years. That's pretty impressive.”—-This story has been corrected to reflect that Netflix's DVD service had more than 20 million subscribers at its peak, not 16 million.]"

""The consumer is proving to be resilient.Here's how Nike's results stacked up against Wall Street analyst expectations, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:Revenue: $12.94 billion vs. $12.99 billion (est.) and $12.69 billion (same period year prior)Adj. earnings per share (EPS): $0.94 vs. $0.75 (est.) and $0.93 (same period year prior)Gross margin estimate: 44.2% vs. 43.7% (est.) and 44.3% (same period year prior)Nike's inventories fell in the quarter to $8.7 billion down 10% compared to the year prior. Analysts had anticipated inventories of $8.84 billion. The metric has been closely tracked since an inventory glut plagued the retailer throughout 2022. Meanwhile, direct-to-consumer sales, a closely watched growth metric for the shoe giant, increased to $5.4 billion, up 6% from the same period a year ago.Nike's stock had stumbled into the report with shares falling 9% over the last month, and Wall Street analysts were warning of a subdued report from the athletic apparel behemoth.Revenue in Greater China had been a key concern for investors headed into the report. The Chinese economy has produced slower economic growth than expected this year. Wall Street analysts fear that could also weigh on companies like Nike, who have significant exposure to China.Story continuesIn the most recent quarter, Nike saw revenue in Greater China at $1.74 billion. Analysts had expected the segment to show $1.83 billion in sales, according to Bloomberg consensus data.""The China story is probably the biggest one here for Nike,"" Forrester Research analyst Sucharita Kodali told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. ""The challenge is that Nike has been very dependent on the Asian market, certainly on the Chinese consumer. Not only do you have issues with the softening of the Chinese consumer and their spending ability but also just a lot of geopolitical risk that is there.""Nike executives cooled concerns over China during the call with investors on Thursday night, though. Nike CEO John Donahoe said he's been to China twice in the past four months and noted he feels good about the market and Nike's position in it.""Sport is back in China, you can just feel it,"" Donahoe said. ""That gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there.""Nike's report also comes about a month after Foot Locker warned of a slowdown in its footwear business due to ""price sensitive"" consumers. About 64% of sales at Foot Locker (FL) are the Nike brand, according to Jefferies. If Foot Locker struggles to offload Nike inventory that could impact the shoe giant's wholesale market, Wall Street analysts noted.But management highlighted during the call that no retail partner represents more than a ""mid-single"" digit portion of Nike's overall sales.For the quarter, Nike reported wholesale revenues growth that came in flat compared to the same period a year prior. The Street had been expecting a decline of 4% from the same period a year prior.Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator Vance Joseph wearing Nike Jordan 1 low tops against the Denver Broncos during an NFL football game Dec. 18, 2022, in Denver.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. At the start of the year, there was a lot of excitement surrounding tech stocks. However, as investor sentiment shifted, other types of investments gained attention. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell by 5.32% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date returns to 27.09%, as of September 28. During uncertain times, investors prefer dependable stocks to earn a steady income and maintain their financial stability.Dividend stocks are often considered relatively stable investments compared to some other types of stocks, particularly those that do not pay dividends. When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn their attention to companies that regularly grow their dividends. Steady and consistent dividend increases indicate that a company is financially strong. This can also assist investors in creating a portfolio that consistently generates high dividend income over time. In our article titled 14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now, we referred to Hartford Funds data and mentioned that companies that either raised or started paying dividends since 1973 have achieved the best returns compared to other stocks. These returns were achieved with less price fluctuations. During this time, dividend growers and initiators provided a 10.24% return, while companies that reduced dividends returned 3.95% to shareholders.Dividend stocks can provide income even when the broader stock market is experiencing declines, which can help investors ride out challenging market conditions. In addition to this, these equities, especially those from established companies, tend to have lower volatility compared to growth stocks, which can experience more significant price swings. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, during the 1970s, a period known for both high inflation and sluggish economic growth, dividends accounted for 70% of the overall returns investors earned. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade in which total returns were negative. Dividend returns of nearly 2% helped offset the negative price returns caused by events like the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis, providing a cushion for investors.Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowWhile dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, have not performed as well as the overall market this year, analysts are optimistic about the potential for these stocks to perform better in the remaining part of the year.

The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”11.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of General Dynamics. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Dynamics?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in General Dynamics. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at General Dynamics' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in General Dynamics. LongView Asset Management, LLC is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 6.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and General Dynamics Corporation 401(K) Plan Master Trust are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of General DynamicsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that General Dynamics Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$374m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over General Dynamics. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - General Dynamics has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

In such a scenario, the demand for military tanks has increased manifold as these form an integral part of any land warfare system.Thus, General Dynamics stands to benefit from the increased demand as its Land Systems is the sole-source producer of two foundational products central to the U.S. Army’s warfighting capabilities — the M1A2Abrams main battle tank and the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle.The company strives to continuously improvise the platform and provide an upgraded version to its customers.

As gasoline and diesel exports have been curbed, there is some concern that similar measures could spread to other commodity classes,"" said Dominic Gallagher, head of LNG broking at Tullett Prebon.""This, with the backdrop of supply issues in Europe, has encouraged further strength in TTF and JKM over the past week,"" he said, referring to Europe's main natural gas futures market the Dutch TTF gas hub, and the Japan-Korea-Marker as the LNG benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargoes in Asia.Russia had last week temporarily banned exports of gasoline and diesel to all countries outside a circle of four ex-Soviet states to stabilise the domestic market, though later on softened the ban. It said this week it may introduce quotas on overseas fuel exports if the export ban fails to bring down high gasoline and diesel prices.Additionally, more tendering activities in the market put upward pressure on Asian prices, said Siamak Adibi, principal consultant at energy consultancy FGE, who also expects Japanese buyers to enter the market soon.""Japanese buyers have not shown significant activity in building up their stockpiles yet ... Our assumption is that they need to increase their inventories through spot purchase before entering to cold months.""Japan's industry ministry said LNG inventories by major electricity utilities will likely increase towards the peak winter demand season, after falling to their lowest since early 2021 on the back of a long and hot summer.Story continuesIn Europe, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily northwest Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in November on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $12.487/mmBtu on Sept. 28, a $0.80/mmBtu discount to the November gas price at the Dutch TTF gas hub, said Shermaine Ang, global LNG markets lead.Rises at the front of the LNG and gas hub curves – driven by expectations for weaker Norwegian gas supply due to upstream maintenance – have tightened inter-month price spreads considerably, as concerns of early winter gas surplus wanes, said Samuel Good, head of LNG pricing at commodity pricing agency Argus, which assessed the north-west Europe DES price at $12.30/mmBtu.Europe gas prices rose to multi-week highs at the start of the week after an extension to Norwegian maintenance outages. Prices later on eased as some maintenance outages ended, though there were revisions in the maintenance schedule for October.On LNG freight, spot rates fell this week, particularly in the Atlantic Basin where a narrowing of the contango between October and November closed floating storage opportunities and freeing up prompt vessels, said Edward Armitage, an analyst at Spark Commodities.The Atlantic rates fell to $174,000/day on Friday, while the Pacific rates eased to $189,000/day.Contango is where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price.

Ten-year yields fell back from fresh 16-year highs, just as a heavy week of new government debt sales totalling more $130 billion came to an end with Thursday's underwhelming $37 billion auction of oft-unloved 7-year notes.At 4.53% on Friday, the 10-year benchmark was some 15 basis points off Thursday's peak and two-year yields fell back to their lowest since Sept. 18.The recoil in oil and bond yields in turn dragged the dollar back down too - with the index now off more than 1% from Wednesday's high for the year.And stocks breathed a sigh of relief too.Wall Street indexes managed a second day of gains on Thursday and S&amp;P500 futures were about 0.5% higher ahead of the open. The VIX volatility gauge fell back sharply to 16.5.World stocks captured by MSCI's all-country index also broke a 9-day losing streak on Thursday and were up for the second day as the week closed out ahead of China's Golden Week break next week.Story continuesSome optimism from Beijing about a possible year-end summit between President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden helped. U.S. and China are discussing a possible trip to Washington by Xi's top economic-policy aide, Vice Premier He Lifeng, the Wall Street Journal reported, and this could pave the way for Xi's trip to the U.S. in November.There was further good news on the European inflation front. Inflation in the euro zone fell more than forecast to its lowest level in two years in September, suggesting the European Central Bank's diet of interest rate hikes is working and may now end.The Federal Reserve's favoured PCE gauge of inflation is due to be updated for August later on Friday and, just like the consumer price report, is expected to show an uptick in the headline rate of inflation while core rates subside further.Although Fed chief Jerome Powell turned down the chance to address the policy outlook at an event late on Thursday - something many observers reckon may be telling in itself - the noises from his colleagues continued to be equivocal about the chances of another rate rise this year.Citing possible economic data outages due the looming government shutdown, Richmond Fed boss Thomas Barkin said it's not yet clear to him what the central bank needs to do on monetary policy into the end of the year.""It would be hard to figure out what's actually happening in the economy without the jobs data,"" he said, referring to possible delays to next week's employment report.In corporate news, sportswear giant Nike lifted the mood. Its shares surged 8% before today's bell after the firm topped Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit as higher prices for its sneakers and apparel offset a hit from waning demand and persistent cost pressures.In Hong Kong, shares of Nio jumped 9% after Reuters reported, citing sources, the Chinese electric vehicle maker is exploring investment and tech alliances with Mercedes-Benz.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* US August PCE inflation gauge, personal income and spending.

Gassco said it was not yet able to provide data for this month.But Gassco CEO Frode Leversund said the maintenance programme was largely completed and deliveries were rising.In Britain, UK gas-for-power demand is forecast higher on the day-ahead as the impact of storm Agnes wanes over the weekend and lower wind speeds are expected.In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract inched up by 0.09 euro to 82.80 euros a tonne.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 158 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite edged higher by 0.1%.Solid gains for stocks early on faded as pressure built from within the bond market. After easing earlier in the day on encouraging signals about inflation, Treasury yields got back to rising as the day progressed.The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield returned to 4.58%, where it was late Thursday, after dipping to 4.52%. It's again near its highest level since 2007.Treasurys are seen as some of the safest investments possible, and when they pay higher yields, investors are less likely to pay high prices for stocks and other riskier investments. That’s a big reason why the S&amp;P 500 dropped 4.9% in September to drag what had been a big gain for the year down to 11.7%Treasury yields have been climbing sharply as Wall Street accepts a new normal where the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates high for longer. The Fed is trying to push still-high inflation down to its target, and its main tool of high interest rates does that by trying to slow the economy and hurting prices for investments.The Fed’s main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001, and the central bank indicated last week it may cut interest rates next year by less than it earlier expected.Friday’s economic data showed that not only was inflation a touch cooler than expected in August, so was growth in spending by U.S. consumers. That can be a positive for inflation because it means not as many dollars are pouring into purchases. That in turn could give companies less encouragement to try to raise prices further. But it may also dent what’s been a big driver keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession.“It came to a boil during a hot summer, and the temperature is really starting to come down,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, of spending growth by U.S. consumers. “Higher energy prices, student loan debt repayments and real disposable incomes that have been on a declining trajectory since June doesn’t bode well.”Story continuesOil prices have jumped to their highest level in more than a year, which is pressuring the economy by raising fuel costs for everyone. A barrel of U.S. crude sank 92 cents Friday to settle at $90.79, but it's still up sharply from $70 in June. Brent crude, the international standard, also weakened.The resumption of U.S. student-loan repayments, meanwhile, may funnel more dollars away from the spending by consumers that has helped to keep the economy afloat.Another, more immediate threat for the economy could hit soon as the U.S. government nears another possible federal shutdown. Markets have broadly held up rather well during past shutdowns, but a few crucial economic reports are scheduled for the next couple of weeks.The latest monthly update on the U.S. jobs market is due next week, with a couple of important reports on inflation coming the following week. Postponements of such reports could complicate things for the Fed, which has insisted it will make upcoming decisions on interest rates based on what incoming data say about the economy. The Fed's next meeting on rates ends on Nov. 1.On Wall Street, Nike jumped 6.7% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Strength overseas helped it make up for some declines in North America.Blue Apron soared 134.5% after the meal kit company said it was being bought by Wonder Group for $13 per share in cash in a deal valued at $103 million.On the losing end of Wall Street were stocks of energy producers, hurt by the slide in oil's price. Energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 fell 2% as a group, more than double the loss of any of the other 10 sectors that make up the index.Exxon Mobil fell 1.6%, and Schlumberger dropped 4.3%. Energy stocks, though, remain the market’s standout performers since the summer.Shares of Ford and General Motors slipped after the United Auto Workers said it will expand its limited strike to include another facility for each. Ford fell 1.1%, and GM dipped 0.6%.All told, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 11.65 points to 4,288.05. The Dow dropped 158.84 to 33,507.50, and the Nasdaq added 18.05 to 13,219.32.In stock markets abroad, indexes were modestly higher in Europe after exchanges were closed across much of Asia.___AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.]"

That's largely because of a supply-demand imbalance in the oil market, which is likely to worsen over the next year and push prices higher, Currie said.Currie, who has warned of triple-digit oil prices since late 2022, said there's increased demand for crude, noting that last week saw prices near $100.""What was driving it is demand is exceeding expectations. You're up more than half a million barrels per day above even our bullish expectations,"" he said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday.He also reiterated his call for a commodities ""supercycle,"" referring to a bullish period where commodity prices climb as a result of chronic underinvestment and undersupply.Demand outweighing supply has helped pushed crude prices higher through 2023, with oil surging to a 10-month-high after OPEC+ implemented its hefty supply cuts this summer. Brent crude traded around $95 a barrel on Thursday, while West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $92 a barrel.While Currie estimated demand destruction would occur when oil hits $125-$130, experts say rising oil prices spell more pain for Americans and potentially more trouble for the US economy.That's because higher prices at the gas pump could translate into weaker consumer sentiment, which could hit spending, corporate profits, and eventually, economic growth.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

This was the lowest level of revenue seen since 2003, as reported by the American Gaming Association (AGA). However, the industry is showing signs of a strong recovery as people are returning to casinos for gambling. According to a report by AGA, Americans set a new record for gambling in 2022 through November. Casinos and mobile gaming apps in the US made an impressive $54.93 billion in revenue during the first 11 months of the year.The pandemic's challenges forced the casino and gaming industry to adjust to a new way of doing things. Many casinos accelerated their digital transformation efforts, including the adoption of online gambling platforms and the development of mobile apps for casino games and sports betting. This was in response to the increased demand for online gambling during lockdowns and social distancing measures. This adaptation has also spurred significant growth in the industry in the years following the pandemic. According to a report by Research and Markets, the global gambling market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.3% through 2027, reaching $765.89 billion.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NextEra Energy is:13% = US$7.2b ÷ US$54b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.13.Does NextEra Energy Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, NextEra Energy has a better ROE than the average (8.3%) in the Electric Utilities industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for NextEra Energy visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesNextEra Energy's Debt And Its 13% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by NextEra Energy, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.33. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. At the start of the year, there was a lot of excitement surrounding tech stocks. However, as investor sentiment shifted, other types of investments gained attention. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell by 5.32% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date returns to 27.09%, as of September 28. During uncertain times, investors prefer dependable stocks to earn a steady income and maintain their financial stability.Dividend stocks are often considered relatively stable investments compared to some other types of stocks, particularly those that do not pay dividends. When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn their attention to companies that regularly grow their dividends. Steady and consistent dividend increases indicate that a company is financially strong. This can also assist investors in creating a portfolio that consistently generates high dividend income over time. In our article titled 14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now, we referred to Hartford Funds data and mentioned that companies that either raised or started paying dividends since 1973 have achieved the best returns compared to other stocks. These returns were achieved with less price fluctuations. During this time, dividend growers and initiators provided a 10.24% return, while companies that reduced dividends returned 3.95% to shareholders.Dividend stocks can provide income even when the broader stock market is experiencing declines, which can help investors ride out challenging market conditions. In addition to this, these equities, especially those from established companies, tend to have lower volatility compared to growth stocks, which can experience more significant price swings. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, during the 1970s, a period known for both high inflation and sluggish economic growth, dividends accounted for 70% of the overall returns investors earned. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade in which total returns were negative. Dividend returns of nearly 2% helped offset the negative price returns caused by events like the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis, providing a cushion for investors.Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowWhile dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, have not performed as well as the overall market this year, analysts are optimistic about the potential for these stocks to perform better in the remaining part of the year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”11.

128,f2d11900-6880-3eb7-9b9c-b50ad5c4e124,TSN,2023-09-29,Top 20 Meat Producing Countries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-meat-producing-countries-203614155.html,1695933374,STORY,['TSN'],"[In this article, we will be taking a look at the top 20 meat producing countries in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 meat producing countries in the world.The global meat industry, according to Grand View Research, is currently valued at nearly $1.3 trillion, and is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 2.5% till 2030. While trends are changing in this trillion dollar industry, which we'll discuss later on, it is still expected to be a really important market especially in developing countries as their population continues to grow, which is very important for some of the biggest meat producing countries in the world.After the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the meat industry saw its prices decline while global supply chain gaps and reduced household spending saw meat demand fall, which in turn had a negative impact on some of the biggest meat importing countries excluding China, which despite being among the largest meat producers in the world, is also the biggest importer of meat. In fact, while other countries curtailed imports, China increased its meat imports after African Swine Fever continued to impact local production. Additionally, higher feed costs resulted in profitability in the meat sector declining in 2021, all of which have contributed to an uncertain couple of years in the meat industry.top 20 meat producing countries in the worldStephen Mcsweeny/Shutterstock.comWhile the meat industry has undoubtedly suffered setbacks in recent years, the outlook still seems quite positive in the long term, and production is expected to continue to increase globally with herd expansion taking place in China and the Americas, and improved technology implementation resulting in higher meat production per animal. Further, increasing population in most of the world will see demand increase by 14% by 2030, according to the Organization of Economically Developed Countries, while increased income will also contribute to greater meat consumption. The one drawback in the first few years of the 2020s is the fact that pig meat production will still be limited due to the aforementioned African Swine Fever though production is expected to be back to normal by the end of 2023.Story continuesEven though the outlook is positive, there are definitely some changing trends with respect to meat demand across the world, with such changes generally being divided across geography and income levels. In the West, vegetarianism and veganism are growing in popularity, which has led to a decline in meat consumption. Most European countries are also facing declining birth rates and populations, which again adversely impact demand for meat. In a world which is becoming more and more climate conscious, especially after seeing its devastating impact in regions around the world, meat production has also been under the glare, with its production said to account for nearly a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions, while also contributing to deforestation and forest fires. All of this has led to renewed pressure to develop methods for sustainable meat production in the future, and the cultivated meat industry is a direct result of this. Lab grown meat is now becoming a reality and major meat producers are investing in this area, with McKinsey stating the cultivated meat industry aims to be worth $25 billion by 2030, though it will still contribute less than 1% to the global meat industry. This, plus changing trends in consumption, has led to poultry, or white meat, dominating meat production across the world and according the OECD, poultry meat will account for over 40% of total meat consumption across in 2030, which might see a shift in focus of the biggest meat producing nations in the world, not to mention the biggest meat consuming countries in the world, where unsurprisingly, European countries barely have a mention.In the U.S. itself, the meat industry is currently struggling somewhat, something that is impacting the biggest meat processing companies in the country. The impact has been seen across various meat segments including beef, chicken and pigs, which low margins and supply changes greatly impacting the profits of some of the biggest players in the industry. Inflation has also impacted demand for meat, and recent earnings of major meat companies have taken a major hit because of this. This was called out by JBS, in its Q2 2023 earnings call where it stated ""In the United States, the challenge of beef business will persist for the coming months, consider a scenario of tight margin with a lower cattle supply. Our diversification strategy has been complemented by investments in value-add products and strong brands in the country we operate."" Further challenges include supply of cattle, which the company also mentioned by stating ""In the United States, the challenge of beef business will persist for the coming months, consider a scenario of tight margin with a lower cattle supply. Our diversification strategy has been complemented by investments in value-add products and strong brands in the country we operate."" Because of this, JBS stock has declined by more than 15% YTD 2023.Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), another top meat producing company, also called out the difficult situation the industry is facing currently, stating in its Q2 2023 earnings outlook "" Last quarter, we said that we expected Q2 to be tougher than Q1, and this quarter was definitely a tough one. As you will have seen in our release earlier this morning, results were weaker than expected, and top-line performance was mixed, particularly when compared to our strong performance last year. At the same time, we outperformed our large branded-food peers in volume and dollar sales and continue to gain pound and dollar share in our retail core business lines. As I also said last quarter, I can't remember a time when our business faced the highly unusual situation that we're currently seeing, where all three of our core protein categories, beef, pork, and chicken are experiencing market challenges at the same time. This unusual confluence of issues continued in Q2 and directly impacted our results. I know that you watch the protein markets closely, and like us, know that there are many factors at play here that are macro in nature. For example, beef is cycling out of historically strong margins that were seen throughout most of fiscal 2021 and '22. Cutout values across protein complex are much lower than a year ago. Inflation has also remained elevated and persistent, which has dramatically impacted our cost. The current macro backdrop is clearly tough."" Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) has seen its share price fall by more than 20% YTD, unsurprising considering its recent results. In May 2023, BMO Capital, an investment advisory firm, slashed its target price for Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) from $66 to $48. The company was also mentioned by Aristotle Capital Management LLC, an asset management firm. Here is what the fund said:“During the quarter, we exited our investments in Sun Communities, Elanco Animal Health and Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) and established new positions in Merck and Sysco. We first invested in Tyson Foods during the second quarter of 2019. At the time, we were encouraged by what we had identified as the company’s demonstrated ability to “brand” what had been previously considered pure commodity products. Furthermore, we were attracted to Tyson’s Prepared Food business, consisting of a strong portfolio of brands with attractive margins and the opportunity to gain market share as consumer preferences shifted toward prepared foods. While we believe catalysts remain, we decided to sell, as we were concerned with management changes over the past year, starting with the CEO resigning in 2021 for personal reasons, followed by the resignation of the head of Prepared Foods and exacerbated by the company’s decision to name John R. Tyson, the 32-year-old son of the firm’s chairman, as CFO.”MethodologyTo determine the top meat producing countries in the world, we headed over to the Food and Agriculture Organization, and determined all meat production by country from 2019 to 2021, the last year on record.

The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Business Partnerships Platform has also extended a helping hand to support the latest initiative.After undergoing a successful pilot phase of 12 months, DUAPAY is presently available to micro and small business women entrepreneurs across Fiji. However, the business owners need to carry banking activities with the leading Australian bank, Westpac, in Fiji during the past 12 months in order to avail the newly launched platform.The solution will pave the way for the safe and seamless acceptance of card and digital payments on the mobile devices of women vendors. This will offer an opportunity to boost their income, enhance their financial security, support families and most importantly, bring them under the ambit of a booming digital economy.In the latest partnership, Mastercard will perform the role of linking the payment platform DUAPAY to its extensive worldwide payments network. This may provide higher transaction processing opportunities to the tech giant and subsequently, bolster its revenues earned from payment network.Mastercard’s longstanding endeavor remains to infuse digitization across every corner of the globe and for doing so, reaching out to the unbanked and underserved populations remains of vital importance. Therefore, through the recent alliance, MA’s focus remains to serve the 30% of Fijian population, which remains unaddressed in the financial services sector.Also, the tech giant seems to have pursued a time opportune move as well, considering an assessment of the Women’s Finance Exchange, according to which women-owned Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Fiji make up for 19% of the country’s MSMEs. And the presence of a worldwide trusted company like Mastercard, whose digital arm is built with the help of partnerships and substantial technology investments, will infuse a sense of confidence and security to Fiji’s women entrepreneurs in the greater adoption of digital payments.Story continuesMastercard has always remained steadfast to relieve micro and small businesses from age-old traditional payment methods and empower them to embrace digital means.   In an evolving digital era, wherein businesses are compelled to infuse digitization into their operations, the small business units may often grapple with the dearth of finance and resources. To bail such businesses out of crisis, Mastercard partners with numerous well-established organizations, delivering several innovative digital payment solutions, and pursuing significant investments.Shares of Mastercard have gained 37.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s 21.6% growth.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether QUALCOMM's current trading price of US$111 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at QUALCOMM’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM What's The Opportunity In QUALCOMM?Good news, investors! QUALCOMM is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 14.36x is currently well-below the industry average of 24.76x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because QUALCOMM’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from QUALCOMM?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. QUALCOMM's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 31%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since QCOM is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QCOM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy QCOM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

""If that is in fact true, then at least we have the NATO issue resolved, but there are other issues in addition to just NATO accession that need to be part of our discussions as we move forward.""The previous chairman, Senator Bob Menendez, had blocked the sale for months, over Turkey's objections to Sweden joining NATO but also over President Tayyip Erdogan's human rights record and overflights of the airspace of neighboring Greece. Senate rules forced Menendez to step down as leader of the committee after prosecutors announced he and his wife, Nadine Menendez, faced felony bribery charges. Leaders of the U.S. Senate and House foreign affairs panels review every major foreign arms sale. They regularly ask questions or raise concerns over human rights or diplomatic issues that can delay or stop such deals.Ankara has held out on the ratification of Sweden's NATO membership for months, accusing Stockholm of doing too little against people Turkey sees as terrorists, mainly Kurdish members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).Erdogan said in July he would forward the ratification to parliament when it reopens in October, frustrating some members of Congress who said he could have called it back into session to move Sweden's NATO membership.Story continuesAfter Menendez's indictment was unsealed, Erdogan said Turkey should turn the senator's legal troubles into an opportunity to purchase the fighter jets. ""Menendez being out of the picture is an advantage,"" Erdogan was quoted as telling reporters by Turkish media.Sweden and Finland applied last year to enter NATO after Russia invaded Ukraine. While Finnish membership was sealed in April, Sweden's bid remains held up by Turkey and Hungary.Turkey has said Ankara and Budapest are working in close coordination on the issue.The top Republican on the Senate panel, Senator Jim Risch, has put a hold on arms sales to Hungary over the issue.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $175.9 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2023. The latest modification adds scope for Lockheed to procure initial spares for supporting the deliveries of F-35 jets from the 15th-17th lots. These initial spares include global spares packages, base spares packages, deployment spares packages and an afloat spares package. The contract will serve the Foreign Military Sales customers and non-U.S. Department of Defense participants.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. The company’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft using advanced technologies to meet current warfare needs boost demand significantly.The F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for the Aeronautics business unit. It also accounted for 66% of the segment’s net sales in 2022.Lockheed has delivered 944 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 421 jets in the backlog as of Jun 25, 2023.  This, along with the latest contract win, boosts sales expectations for the segment.Looking ahead, LMT expects to deliver 97 jets in 2023 and more than the earlier projected delivery range of 147-153 in 2024. The jet deliveries for 2025 and beyond are still estimated to be 156. This should bolster the company’s revenues from the military aircraft field.Growth ProspectsAmid the widespread geopolitical tensions prevalent across the globe, nations are rapidly augmenting defense purchase to strengthen their warfare capabilities. This has led to an increased demand for fighter jets, which form an integral part of a country’s defense products.Story continuesLooking ahead, per Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.37% during the 2023-2028 period. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed to reap the benefits of military aircraft market expansion, with its portfolio containing combat-proven jets like F-16 and F-35 fighter aircraft.Other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT. These stocks are also expected to gain from the military aircraft market’s growth opportunities.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft. From fighter jets and stealth bombers to surveillance and electronic warfare, it has been providing manned solutions to customers worldwide. The company has built some of the world’s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye.NOC’s Aeronautics Systems unit is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of advanced aircraft systems. Meanwhile, the Mission Systems segment offers advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems like Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control, the LONGBOW Fire Control Radar and the Scalable Agile Beam Radar.Airbus Group’s military aircraft consists of the A400M, the C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived.The company has been providing its aircraft customers with an extended portfolio of services for more than 40 years, ranging from the training of flight and ground staff to live firing exercises anywhere worldwide.Textron’s military aircraft includes the Beechcraft T-6 training aircraft and the Beechcraft AT-6 light-attack aircraft. The company also manufactures the Beechcraft Model 18 light bomber, the T-44 and T-34 training aircraft, and the T-1A jet trainer.TXT’s subsidiary, Able Aerospace Services, provides component and maintenance, repair and overhaul services in support of commercial and military fixed and rotor-wing aircraft.Price MovementShares of Lockheed have rallied 4.9% in the past 12 months against the industry’s 3.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The firm believes Tractor Supply fits 11 of the 12 criteria required to qualify as a ""Best-of-Breed Bison"" name within the firm's framework.DA Davidson upgraded Redfin (RDFN) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $8, down from $8.50. The stock's 55% decline since July 12 creates a more balanced risk/reward, the firm tells investors in a research note.JPMorgan upgraded Huntington Ingalls (HII) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $247, down from $250. Huntington is down 10% the past three months on little news, and while it has been a tough market for defense stocks, the selloff creates an attractive entry point, the firm argues.JPMorgan upgraded DigitalBridge (DBRG) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $25, up from $19. The firm believes the ""transformed"" DigitalBridge is a direct way for investors to benefit from digital infrastructure investment management on a global basis without being fully invested to one vertical or region.More bullish on the name, Northcoast upgraded Essential Utilities (WTRG) to Buy from Neutral.

The firm cites the recent outperformance and ""mounting concerns"" about the potential collateral damage from the current downturn for stepping to the sidelines.JPMorgan downgraded NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $40, down from $69. The company significantly lowered its targeted dividend growth based on an inability to accretively add drop-downs from parent company NextEra Energy (NEE), owing to an elevated cost of capital, the firm says. Oppenheimer also downgraded NextEra Energy Partners to Perform from Outperform without a price target.KeyBanc downgraded Terex (TEX) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target. The firm thinks order rates could moderate from recently elevated levels at the same time supply chain improvements allow for revenue increases and faster backlog monetization.KeyBanc downgraded Oshkosh (OSH) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target. The firm says ""potential signs of bad news"" will have an outsized negative impact on the shares relative to the potential upside good news could provide.H.C.

The firm thinks Boeing can deliver $22 in free cash flow per share and a net cash balance sheet by 2027, but notes that ""the stock looks nearly fairly valued against it.""Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of Lockheed Martin (LMT) with a Hold rating and $435 price target. The firm sees recent commentary on inflation-driven margin pressure as a concern, particularly with Lockheed increasingly trading on margin performance rather than revenue.Bernstein initiated coverage of Thermo Fisher (TMO) with an Outperform rating and $603 price target. The firm says the U.S. life science tools and diagnostics has the same positives as other healthcare sub-sectors, like enduring growth drivers, customers with locked-in processes, increasingly higher-margin/higher recurring revenue, and positive price, as well as a few of the negatives, like high levels of risk from pharma's patent cliffs and managed care mis-pricing.UBS initiated coverage of Trade Desk (TTD) with a Buy rating and $100 price target.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. At the start of the year, there was a lot of excitement surrounding tech stocks. However, as investor sentiment shifted, other types of investments gained attention. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell by 5.32% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date returns to 27.09%, as of September 28. During uncertain times, investors prefer dependable stocks to earn a steady income and maintain their financial stability.Dividend stocks are often considered relatively stable investments compared to some other types of stocks, particularly those that do not pay dividends. When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn their attention to companies that regularly grow their dividends. Steady and consistent dividend increases indicate that a company is financially strong. This can also assist investors in creating a portfolio that consistently generates high dividend income over time. In our article titled 14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now, we referred to Hartford Funds data and mentioned that companies that either raised or started paying dividends since 1973 have achieved the best returns compared to other stocks. These returns were achieved with less price fluctuations. During this time, dividend growers and initiators provided a 10.24% return, while companies that reduced dividends returned 3.95% to shareholders.Dividend stocks can provide income even when the broader stock market is experiencing declines, which can help investors ride out challenging market conditions. In addition to this, these equities, especially those from established companies, tend to have lower volatility compared to growth stocks, which can experience more significant price swings. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, during the 1970s, a period known for both high inflation and sluggish economic growth, dividends accounted for 70% of the overall returns investors earned. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade in which total returns were negative. Dividend returns of nearly 2% helped offset the negative price returns caused by events like the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis, providing a cushion for investors.Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowWhile dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, have not performed as well as the overall market this year, analysts are optimistic about the potential for these stocks to perform better in the remaining part of the year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”11.

Within Cardiovascular, Medtronic is gaining market share, banking on product launches. However, forex woes and stiff rivalry do not bode well for MDT.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decline 1.1% compared with the industry’s 8.4% fall and a 6.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $104.07 billion. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 3.37%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsMarket Share Gain Within Cardiovascular to Continue: Medtronic is expanding its global foothold within the Cardiovascular business (contributing more than 37% to total revenues in fiscal 2023). Within Cardiovascular, cardiac rhythm management, one of Medtronic’s largest businesses, continued to build on the company’s category leadership. Medtronic’s pacing business continued outperforming the market within cardiac rhythm management, banking on strong global growth of its Micra leadless pacemaker family as it enters new geographies and expands penetration in existing markets.Decent Sales Projections Within MedSurg: Within Medtronic’s Medical Surgical Portfolios, the company is gaining from the positive sales momentum with the rollout of its differentiated Hugo robotic system in many international markets. The company is also progressing well to bring Hugo to the United States. We are also impressed by Medtronic’s strong performance within Advanced Energy and Barrx, primarily driven by improved supply and continued growth in GI Genius and PillCam. Given less than 5% of surgical procedures globally are done robotically, Medtronic expects its surgical robotics business to become a meaningful growth driver soon.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesInternational Expansion Robust: in fiscal 2023, Medtronic generated nearly 48% of its revenues from the rest of the world. The company focuses on expanding in emerging markets to address the massively unmet and untapped demand for advanced medical technologies. In the fiscal first quarter, non-U.S. developed markets and Western Europe grew in the high single digits. Western Europe grew 8% again this quarter, with high-single-digit growth in Cardiovascular and Medical Surgical and high teen growth in Diabetes. Emerging markets grew 8% despite the adverse impact of new sanctions in Russia and the ongoing volume-based procurement (VBP) effect in China.DownsidesExposure to Currency Movement: With Medtronic recording a significant portion of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a significant dampener over the last few quarters, as with other important MedTech players. Medtronic expects its second-quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings would be negatively impacted by approximately 6% from adverse currency translation.Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. Medtronic earns most revenues from CRDM, Spinal and Cardio Vascular segments. The company faces intense competition in the CRDM segment from players such as Boston Scientific Corporation. Players such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Stryker Corporation, Zimmer and NuVasive have intensified competition, particularly in the Spinal segment.Estimate TrendsMedtronic has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Auto Components and Parts Stocks to Buy Now.The US auto industry is currently in the spotlight amid a massive United Auto Workers’ strike against three major companies, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.  Analysts are now certain that these strikes will have direct effects on financial results of these companies in the coming months. Wall Street Journal recently reported that Wells Fargo analysts believe that the three companies’ proposals to increase auto workers’ salaries would “add an estimated $700 million to $1.2 billion in costs to each company over the four-year life of the contract.” Estimates suggest that these costs will reach $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion under the union’s demand of 30% increase in wages, plus cost-of-living adjustments.However, the WSJ report quoted Richard Hilgert, a senior equity analyst for the automotive sector at Morningstar’s research arm, who said that despite the strikes the auto companies are still in a position to escape massive losses given these strikes don’t prolong.Analysts are also hinting that these strikes could expand to other parts of the industry, including the electric vehicle companies. Many auto components and parts companies that are directly or indirectly linked with traditional car companies and EV companies are anxiously waiting for these strikes to end. And they also have other plans in case the strikes do not end soon. The Wall Street Journal report quoted Ricardo Rodriguez, chief financial officer at Aspen Aerogels. Aspen Aerogels makes battery safety products for electric cars. Rodriguez said that if strikes in the auto industry expand to the EV sector or do not end soon, his company is ready to shift its focus to energy industrial products. The executive said his company could make the shift “within an hour.” Other companies are not that fortunate, though. Companies that supply parts and technologies to major car companies like Ford and General Motors are heavily reliant on the normal business cycle and these current disruptions could take a toll on their business. For example, according to the WSJ report,  Sensata Technologies, which makes sensors for cars, could see huge impact from the current strikes as Ford, GM and Stellantis account for a major chunk of the company’s revenue. The report, citing the company’s Vice President of Finance Jacob Sayer, said that about 9% of Sensata’s global revenue could be impacted if all plants for the three carmakers are offline.Story continuesFor this article we first used a stock screener to list down all publicly traded companies that make and sell auto parts and components.

The company's strong cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Moreover, expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Further, its deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Alphabet's expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. Its growing efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives.However, sluggishness in the company's Network advertisement business remains a headwind. Additionally, its growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the year-to-date period (+8.2% vs. +6.2%).

The company has seen faster-than-expected price declines from the highs reached after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, as supplies from Belarus and Russia gradually found their way around the global sanctions. Also, higher cost inflation has delayed discretionary fertilizer purchases by farmers. However, we believe the global agricultural cycle remains broadly supportive. With fertilizer prices normalizing above the pre-pandemic levels, pent up demand from farmers’ need to replenish diminished soil land banks, and continued pressure on Belarussian and Russian supplies, we believe the company’s earnings power will remain at above-history levels. Additionally, the company’s commitment to share repurchases and debt paydowns has accreted value to existing shareholders and signaled a commitment by management to continue to do so.""Story continues15 Largest Potash Producing Countries in the Worldwk1003mike/Shutterstock.comThe Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

(The) (WMB). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Kinder Morgan and Williams Companies, Inc. (The) are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that KMI is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.KMI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.10, while WMB has a forward P/E of 17.67. We also note that KMI has a PEG ratio of 5.03. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate.

So, stay with us to uncover the hidden potentials of this aerospace giant.A Glimpse into Boeing Co (NYSE:BA)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with BA. Click here to check it out. BA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BABoeing Co operates in four segments: commercial airplanes; defense, space, and security; Global services; and Boeing capital. Competing with Airbus in the production of aircraft and with Lockheed, Northrop, and several others in the creation of military aircraft and weaponry, Boeing Co has established itself as a significant force in the industry. With a stock price of $190.43 and a market cap of $114.90 billion, the company's value is a topic of interest for investors. The GF Value, a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, for Boeing Co is $234.28.Boeing Co (BA): An Underestimated Powerhouse in Aerospace and Defense?Deciphering the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.For Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), the GF Value suggests that the stock is modestly undervalued. Consequently, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Boeing Co (BA): An Underestimated Powerhouse in Aerospace and Defense?Assessing Boeing Co's Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss to investors. To avoid such a loss, it's crucial to evaluate a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. Key indicators of financial strength include the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. With a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.26, Boeing Co ranks worse than 68.38% of 291 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. This statistic indicates that the financial strength of Boeing Co is relatively poor.Story continuesBoeing Co (BA): An Underestimated Powerhouse in Aerospace and Defense?Boeing Co's Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is generally less risky. Boeing Co has been profitable 6 out of the past 10 years. However, with an operating margin of -4.63%, it ranks worse than 75% of 292 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. This statistic suggests fair profitability.The growth of a company is a vital factor in its valuation. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Boeing Co is -6.1%, ranking worse than 73.38% of 263 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. This statistic suggests that the company's growth is relatively poor.Comparing ROIC and WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC) provides another perspective on its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, the ROIC should be higher than the WACC. However, for Boeing Co, the ROIC is -3.54, and the WACC is 10.81.Boeing Co (BA): An Underestimated Powerhouse in Aerospace and Defense?ConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) appears to be modestly undervalued.

Two of the 19 passengers were seriously injured, but all passengers and the four crew members were able to escape before fire destroyed the plane.The plane, which had not flown in six months, was taking passengers from Texas to a baseball playoff game in Boston.The NTSB said both elevators – movable panels on the horizontal section of the tail that are used to point the nose up or down – were jammed in a way that prevented the plane from becoming airborne.Investigators believe the parts became stuck because the plane was exposed to high wind while parked for an extended period. A similar jamming occurred with another MD-80-series plane in 2017 in Michigan, leading the NTSB to prompt Boeing to issue new instructions in 2020 for inspecting similar planes before flights.The Texas plane was operated by Everts Air Cargo. Everts’ director of operations said he didn’t know about the Boeing bulletin until after the accident. The company later updated its manuals and made photos and videos showing pilots how to examine elevators from the ground.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now.Legendary value investor Howard Marks started writing memos to investors decades ago. These memos are still very famous and the co-founder of Oaktree Capital stills writes memos to investors that are read widely among investor circles worldwide. In a latest memo, Marks recalls how many years ago when he started writing memos to investors he had written a sentence that went on to become a motto of Oaktree since the sentence proved its mettle and truth over the years:If we avoid the losers, the winners will take care of themselves.One of the fundamental truths in investing has been to avoid losers and control risks. You just cannot bet all your money on stocks that are highly risky. But in his September memo Marks talks at length to clarify a confusion: there’s a difference between risk avoidance and risk control. If you want to avoid risk, just do nothing and no harm will be done to you. But that comes at a cost, obviously. You won’t see any gains either. In the investing world, those who want to avoid risks should put their money in government-guaranteed Treasury bills and sleep peacefully. But the downside is that these bills post the lowest returns available. On the other hand, risk control mean living with the reality of the world where risk is a constant in almost every domain.  What makes a smart investor stand out is their ability to take calculated risks. Marks said:“Risks like this needn’t be avoided. If you have real insight, such risks can be borne prudently and profitably. I know several investors who take much more risk than Oaktree does and whose bad years are much worse than ours. But the few who possess genuine skill – what I call “alpha” (more on that later) – produce jumbo returns in their good years, such that their long-term returns are exceptional. Their clients are well rewarded . . . assuming they have enough intestinal fortitude to hang in through the bad years. Thus, risk-taking isn’t unwise per se, and risk avoidance is appropriate only for investors who feel they can’t survive tough times.”Story continuesBest Depressed Stocks to Buy in 2023Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article first used a stock screener to list down all the stocks that recently fell to 52-week lows or are currently trading very close to their 52-week low values.

(NASDAQ:ILMN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) shares fell in August after the company cut its full-year guidance. Evercore ISI included Illumina, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) indeed appointed Jacob Thaysen as the company's new CEO, effective Sept. 25.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:12 Best Large-Cap Value ETFs12 Best Small-Cap Value ETFs10 Best Quant ETFsDisclosure: None. 14 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Recent Activist Investor Campaigns.It's never a dull day in the markets with activist investors deploying all kinds of strategies in the race to unlock and maximize hidden value in highly undervalued stocks. Since 2017, campaigns by activist investors that purchase minority stakes and push for strategic changes have been on the rise. While the activism eased during the Covid 19 pandemic, they have increased in recent years with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the opening up of the global economy.The impact of activist investors is growing in the US and worldwide, depicted by a tidal wave of campaigns spread far and wide. Often referred to as corporate raiders, activist investors acquire minority stakes in companies they feel are trading below their fair value. They buy stakes to influence management, operations, and policies to try and unlock any hidden value.Activist investor's ultimate goal is to improve the performance and value of the companies they invest in. Consequently, they use tactics not limited to public campaigns or private negotiations. In extreme cases, they engineer proxy fights calling for management changes and seats on the board in the race to influence policies.Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman, Nelson Peltz, and Daniel Loeb are some of the notable names called in the same breath with the biggest activist campaigns. The corporate raiders have been on a roll in recent years, with most engineering campaigns on stock valuations tanking at the height of the pandemic. In the race to pursue strong financial returns and strategic accountability, investors are increasingly taking on executives they feel are underperforming.Activist's campaigns were on a roll in 2022, buoyed by tumbling markets that provided a leeway for activist investors to target stocks that had plunged significantly. More than 900 companies were targeted by activist investors, up 6% from 2021.Story continuesIn the first quarter of 2023, 69 new activist campaigns were the second-highest number since 2019. By the end of the year’s first half, there were about 850 campaigns, much higher than the 762 campaigns recorded in the first half of 2022. Additionally, 85% of the campaigns had an ESG component, with corporate governance the most common theme.Stocks in the consumer goods industry remain the most targeted as they play host to larger companies with low debt levels and strong cash generation prospects. Their scale often offers activist investors a reason to push for cost-cutting and divestments, operational improvements, and adoption of new technologies.Activist campaigns targeting financial institutions surged by more than 60% in the first half of the year as the banking crisis was escalating in the US. However, the scrutiny eased as the half came to an end amid improving fundamentals.In the first half of the year, activist campaigns targeting the Technology sector stood at 25%, followed by Industrial at 21% and Healthcare at 13%. The campaigns were vast and concentrated on companies with a market capitalization of above $10 billion at 24% of the campaigns. A good number of the campaigns also came with M&amp;A demands. On the other, activism has increased in the Utilities sector amid deteriorating performance on concerns about the economy. The health services sector has not been spared either.The increase in activist campaigns came with a new trend dubbed swarming that involves pursuing campaigns in companies already targeted by activists. Some of the companies targeted as part of the new strategy included salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (NYSE:BAYRY), and Seven &amp; i Holdings.15 Recent Activist Investor CampaignsSource:unsplashIn addition, activist campaigns used to be more relaxed than they were. In the past, the corporate raiders would take a strong stand and fight through a proxy contest. The companies are listening to shareholders more and engineer board nominations to influence policies. Proxy fights and lawsuits appear to have taken a back seat.In recent years, activist investors have also been looking into Europe as a more attractive market, which explains why the region accounted for the lion's share of new campaigns. While there was a 34% decline in activist campaigns early in the year in the US, there was a 30% increase in Europe. Activist investors are increasingly targeting large European companies offering greater growth and returns potential.Despite the uncertainties in the global markets amid monetary policy disparity and recession risks, activist investors continue to push companies with the number of global campaigns holding above the four-year average.Our MethodologyActivist campaigns are always cropping as institutional investors like hedge funds scan the market for undervalued stocks that can generate significant returns once strategic alternatives are triggered. We have compiled a list of the most recent activist campaigns an ranked them based on when they occurred.15. Trian Partners at The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Activist Campaign: February 2023The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was the subject of an aggressive activist investor campaign early in the year over claims it was in crisis for shedding more than $120 billion in market value in 2022.

Politan Capital also raised concerns about Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI)'s capital allocation and board oversight.In addition, the activist investor has taken issue with what it terms an unfocused strategy, therefore calling for management change.

He also called for the CEO to step down while pushing for board seats.The activist investor garnered enough support in May to oust the biotech company's board chair, John Thompson, in May.

Legion Partners Asset Management at OneSpan Inc.

Today's champion stocks are tomorrow's bums and vice versa. For investors, the conundrum is determining when the downtrodden stocks will turn around. Buying after a long price decline is risky because investors must distinguish between the proverbial ""falling knife"" that may continue to drop versus an opportunity to buy a quality stock that will appreciate nicely over time.Sometimes it pays to watch for trends and gauge what should be the future direction of a sector.  Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been hammered since 2022 with interest rate increases. At the last Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve promised another hike in 2023 and spooked the markets by stating that higher rates may have to continue for a longer time. REITs sold off heavily after those comments.But there is one REIT subsector — residential REITs — that could benefit from a prolonged higher interest rate cycle. Take a look at three residential REITs that could see strong earnings for some time to come.Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how to collect $1,000 per month from Buffett's favorite dividend stock.Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE:MAA) is a self-administered residential REIT that specializes in purchasing and leasing apartment complexes. It owns just under 102,000 units in 300 communities across 16 states and Washington, D.C. Most of Mid-America Apartment Communities' properties are in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic states.Mid-America Apartment Communities is a member of the S&amp;P 500 and has been a public company for 28 years. The Atlanta and Dallas areas comprise over 22% of its same-store net operating income.Story continuesAmerican Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:AMH) is a Calabasas, California-based residential REIT that purchases, develops, renovates and leases existing and build-to-rent single-family homes. American Homes 4 Rent was created in 2012 and in 11 years has built a portfolio of more than 60,000 single-family units across 21 states. Its largest concentration of homes is in the Southeastern U.S., where population growth has been explosive. Its most recent occupancy rate was 96.5%.Equity LifeStyle Properties Inc. (NYSE:ELS) is a Chicago-based residential REIT with a focus on manufactured home communities, RV resorts, marinas and campgrounds in North America. Equity LifeStyle owns 450 communities across 35 states and British Columbia. It was founded in 1992 and had its initial public offering (IPO) in 1993.With single-family homes so expensive, manufactured homes remain an alternative for people who would love to buy a home but have a limited budget or down payment funds.The following charts are from the National Association of Realtors' (NAR) August housing report. The first shows the total existing home sales in two-month intervals between August 2019 to August 2023. Note the downward trend since February 2022, when interest rates began climbing higher in anticipation of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates:The next chart shows the median price of existing home sales over the same four-year time frame. Note that the general trend of prices has been higher, and despite a downturn last fall and winter, prices have risen again during 2023. This is surprising given that 30-year mortgage interest rates have been climbing and were recently at 7.48%, which is the highest interest rate since 2000.Higher interest rates make pricier housing even more unaffordable and increase the likelihood that homeowners with 3% to 4% mortgage rates will remain in their homes rather than move into another home with a 7% mortgage rate. This keeps the housing supply levels tight and has contributed to the higher prices, despite the slowdown in sales.So, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said there are more rate hikes to come and that high-interest rates would be of longer duration, the markets sold off, and REITs were especially hard hit. But the REITs cited above and other similar REITs could actually benefit as rental demand continues to be strong.Single-family homes are particularly attractive to renters who prefer the space and privacy of a home but lack the down payment or cannot afford the principal, interest, taxes and insurance (PITI) needed to buy a home right now.The two reasons the market has punished these residential REITs are:A fear that increased construction of rental units will create too much supply.Concerns that rents may now have peaked.The same fears were in the market during the 2008-2011 period when many new construction rental units were being built because people were too afraid to buy homes, and yet demand and rents increased heavily over the next decade.Another factor being overlooked by Wall Street is that the higher costs of new construction will necessitate higher rents in new apartments or single-family homes than rents in existing residential units. Materials and labor are much more expensive now than before 2020. Higher prices in newly constructed properties will keep demand high in the existing units and may even pull prices up in older units.Rather than inflation, the greater risk to the residential REITs is another recession like the one that began in 2007. During recessions, many younger renters lose their jobs or are downsized, so they return to living with their parents or give up their leases to move in with roommates. The Fed maintains it is determined to have a soft landing rather than a tough recession from its policies.Mid-America Apartments' second-quarter earnings were positive, with both funds from operations (FFO) and revenue increasing year-over-year and beating analysts' estimates. American Homes 4 Rent also beat estimates, improved earnings from the second quarter of 2022 and raised its full-year 2023 guidance. Equity Lifestyles' second-quarter FFO was in line with estimates, but revenue beat the estimates and was up year over year.Investors may want to forget the noise coming out of Wall Street about rents having peaked and an over-supply of rental units. Residential REITs could prove to be one of the strongest REIT subsectors when the next round of earnings reports comes out in October.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

168,634ebbd4-aab9-3cdf-ae42-6dc7a018a782,CI,2023-09-29,Is The Cigna Group's (NYSE:CI) Latest Stock Performance Being Led By Its Strong Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-groups-nyse-ci-latest-130040033.html,1695906040,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna Group's (NYSE:CI) stock up by 4.1% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Cigna Group's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Group How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna Group is:15% = US$6.8b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Cigna Group's Earnings Growth And 15% ROEAt first glance, Cigna Group seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Cigna Group was able to see a decent growth of 16% over the last five years.We then compared Cigna Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 11% in the same 5-year period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Cigna Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Cigna Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Cigna Group's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 21% (implying that it retains 79% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.Additionally, Cigna Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 19% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 17%.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Cigna Group's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value Trap,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vf-vfc-too-good-true-153913980.html,1695915553,STORY,"['VFC', 'VALU']","[Value-focused investors are always on the hunt for stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that merits attention is VF Corp (NYSE:VFC). The stock, which is currently priced at 16.62, recorded a loss of 1.74% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 9.63%. The stock's fair valuation is $61.8, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with VFC. Click here to check it out. VFC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VFCThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with VF should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score of 2, Altman Z-score of 1.34. These indicators suggest that VF, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Decoding the Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-scoreThe Piotroski F-score, created by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess the strength of a company's financial health. The score is based on nine criteria that fall into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/ source of funds, and operating efficiency. The overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating healthier financials. VF's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Story continuesBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company SnapshotVF designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its apparel categories are active, outdoor, and work. Its portfolio of about a dozen brands includes Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. VF markets its products in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through wholesale sales to retailers, e-commerce, and branded stores owned by the company and partners. The company has grown through multiple acquisitions and traces its roots to 1899.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAnalysis of VF's ProfitabilityLet's delve deeper into VF's financial health by examining the decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates 2021: 7.66; 2022: 7.45; 2023: 0.84, when expressed in percentages. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in VF.Observing the financials of VF, it's important to note that the cash flow from operations over the trailing twelve months (TTM) stands at $-133.9 million, whereas the net income in the same period is significantly higher at $117.12 million. The Piotroski F-score considers this discrepancy as a potential red flag. The rationale behind this is that a company's operating cash flow is a more direct and less manipulated measure of its cash-generating ability than net income. Net income, while important, is susceptible to accounting treatments and non-cash items which can distort the true cash profitability of the company. If a company consistently shows lower cash flows from operations relative to its net income, it could indicate that the earnings quality is poor and the company might have difficulties sustaining its operations or financing its obligations, a fact which could negatively impact its financial stability and investor confidence.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendAssessing the aspect of leverage, liquidity, and sources of funds, VF demonstrates an alarming rise in its debt-to-total assets ratio over the past three years. The provided data shows 2021: 0.51; 2022: 0.48; 2023: 0.56, expressed as percentages. A higher debt ratio suggests that VF is increasingly financing its assets through debt, thereby escalating its financial risk. The Piotroski F-Score views this as a negative indicator, further cautioning investors about VF.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapExamining VF's financial stability, there's a notable decrease in its current ratio over the past three years, as shown by the data 2021: 1.49; 2022: 1.33; 2023: 1.37, which is expressed as percentages. The current ratio is a key indicator of a company's short-term financial health, as it gauges the ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. A declining current ratio suggests that VF's liquidity and capability to manage immediate financial obligations are deteriorating.Operating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, VF follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2021: 53.47; 2022: 54.04; 2023: 52.28 (expressed in percentages). This contraction in gross margin suggests that VF is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.In terms of operational efficiency, another key indicator, VF has unfortunately reported a declining trend in asset turnover over the past three years, as evidenced by the data: 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 (expressed in percentages). Asset turnover measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales, and a decrease in this ratio can indicate a drop in efficiency. This could be due to various factors, such as underutilization of assets or a decline in the market demand for the company's products or services. Consequently, this downward trend in asset turnover implies that VF may need to revisit its operational strategies to improve the utilization of its assets and boost its sales volume.While the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for VF, its current score suggests potential troubles.VF's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of VF's Altman Z-score reveals VF's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating VF's historical data, 2021: 0.02; 2022: 0.01; 2023: 0.00, we observe a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. This downward movement indicates VF's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of VF's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.08; 2022: 0.11; 2023: 0.02) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that VF might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for VF is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 from the past three years suggests a decreasing trend in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in VF's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.Is VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) a Value Trap?In conclusion, despite VF's seemingly undervalued status based on the GF Value, the company exhibits several warning signs. The low Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-score, coupled with a decline in profitability, increasing debt, and deteriorating operational efficiency, suggest VF could potentially be a value trap. Investors should exercise due diligence and consider these risk factors before makingThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

With the introduction of this feature, it will now enable its Spanish-speaking customers to use this solution.Michelle Moore, head of WFC’s Digital for Consumer and Wealth &amp; Investment Management stated, “Seeing the volume of Fargo interactions since it went live earlier this year demonstrates that our customers are finding value in an in-your-pocket financial assistant to manage their banking experience,”He further added, “Managing finances can oftentimes be complex if a customer isn’t well-versed in how to measure how they are spending, saving, or budgeting – now available to the second largest language population of our customers.”An increase in the U.S. Latino population over the years and faster growth in their family wealth compared with that of a typical U.S. household makes the move a strategic fit.While instilling this feature in Fargo, WFC ensured to make it comprehensive. For this, it leveraged the knowledge of its employees speaking Spanish, representing over a dozen of different Spanish-speaking countries to test and train Fargo. This would enable Fargo to understand different regional languages and dialects of the language.Customers who wish to use this feature can set their language preference to Spanish in their mobile applications. They can input their request by talking or typing and get instant access to their banking details as well as use Fargo to complete a multitude of tasks like, transferring money, checking their spendings and credit score, managing the spending limits, and viewing rates and fees.Story continuesWells Fargo intends to bring more capabilities to Fargo in the upcoming period to provide its customers with a more sophisticated financial experience. The capabilities are likely to leverage predictive analytics that would enable meaningful conversations and adapt to each individual customer.In the upcoming quarters, Fargo is expected to deliver various services. These include a check on spendings that proactively provides push notifications to the customers about a rise in spending volumes along with its respective categories. It would also analyze the customers’ spending habits and sharing projections about the anticipated balances.Further it would monitor subscriptions/other recurring transactions and provide an option to cancel/pause them. It would monitor customers’ deposits and deliver recommendations on allocation of their money according to their financial goals. Also, it is expected to simplify budgeting by calculating the amount of safe spends.Wells Fargo’s shares have gained 7.6% over the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 0.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWFC presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

C is likely to cut jobs in Tampa post the announcement by CEO Jane Fraser regarding elimination of extra management layers earlier this month. This news was reported by The Business Journals.Tampa is home to more than 10,000 of Citigroup’s employees and represents over two dozen of its business lines including security services, private banking, legal support, compliance and risk management, and human resources.Earlier this month, Reuters reported that job cuts were most likely to take place for employees in the compliance and risk management segments. Also, the staff engaged in overlapping functions in the technology department had a high risk of being laid off.Further, this week, per a Reuters article, Citigroup alerted employees in the U.K. of probable redundancies. Its U.K. business has 16,000 employees but it was unclear which areas of it will be affected by job cuts. Markedly, as many as hundreds of roles are expected to be affected. The company is likely to set up a consultation process, whereby employees can give their feedback.Workforce trimming is part of the multi-phase strategic reform by Fraser, that will make the decision-making process swifter, drive increased accountability and enhance focus on clients.While next phase of this strategy is expected to be communicated to employees by November end, the first phase is to remove unnecessary complexity across the bank.With a view to achieve this, the new model removes management layers in Personal Banking &amp; Wealth Management, and the Institutional Clients Group.

Still, in addition to is COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, Pfizer has a pipeline of drugs and vaccines that target inflammation and immunology, rare diseases, and oncology.  As Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine sales continue to fade earnings are expected to drop -49% in fiscal 2023 to $3.33 a share following a record year that saw EPS at $6.58 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to dip another -3% at $3.22 a share but would still represent 45% growth over the last five years with EPS at $2.22 in 2020.Piggybacking on Pfizer’s top line, sales are forecasted to decline -34% this year to $66.47 billion versus $100.33 billion last year which was also a company record. Fiscal 2024 sales are expected to stabilize and be virtually flat with projections of $66.16 billion representing 58% growth over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchModerna’s DevelopmentModerna’s stock has dropped -44% this year and is currently trading around $100 and near its 52-week low of $95 a share. Outside of its Covid-19 vaccine Spikevax, Moderna is focused on discovering and developing messenger-RNA (mRNA) based therapies for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.Story continuesAt the moment, Moderna generates all of its product sales from Covid-19 vaccines. After high profitability over the last few years, Moderna’s earnings are forecasted back in the red at an adjusted loss of -$4.32 a share in FY23 plummeting from $20.12 per share last year. Fiscal 2024 EPS projections call for a wider adjust loss of -$5.56 a share.Total sales are projected at $6.88 billion this year compared to $19.26 billion in 2022. Fiscal 2024 sales are expected to dip another -4% to $6.59 billion but would still be a very stellar 723% increase over the last five years with sales at $803 million in 2020.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAstraZeneca’s StabilityAstraZeneca’s stock performance is virtually flat this year and while shares of AZN are 26% above 52-week lows they still trade -12% from their 52-week high. As one of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world, UK-based AstraZeneca has seen stable growth even as sales of its COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria fade.To that point, AstraZeneca’s therapeutic lines cover cardiovascular, respiratory, immunology, oncology, and rare diseases among others. AstraZeneca’s annual earnings are anticipated to rise 10% this year and jump another 14% in FY24 to $4.19 per share. Fiscal 2024 EPS projections would be 108% growth over the last five years with earnings at $2.01 a share in 2020.Plus, sales are forecasted to rise 3% in FY23 and pop another 11% in FY24 to $51.18 billion. With sales at $26.61 billion in 2020, FY24 sales projections would represent 92% growth over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation ComparisonWhile AstraZeneca’s outlook certainly stands out among its Covid-19 vaccine peers, Pfizer’s valuation is the most compelling. Pfizer’s stock trades at 9.8X forward earnings which is a nice discount to its Zacks Large-Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry average of 14.4X and well below the S&amp;P 500’s 20X.AstraZeneca’s stock trades at an 18.5X forward earnings multiple which is not a stretched premium to the Large-Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry average and also below the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile it’s not viable to track Moderna’s valuation through the P/E metric at the moment the company's sales expansion is the reason why there is still much optimism. Furthermore, in terms of price to sales Moderna trades at 5.5X which is much more reasonable than its five-year high of 266.4X and beneath the median of 7.9X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line At the moment, Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca stock all land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Despite slowing COVID-19 vaccine sales these healthcare titans are trading at more reasonable valuations with a lot of the risk-to-reward being priced into their stocks considering their earnings potential. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But not all the stocks in the index have participated in this rally. Some are down a double-digit percentage year-to-date.Sometimes the selloff in a stock is overdone, bringing high quality names to levels that should start to pique the interest of value investors. This is especially true if the stock in question has excellent fundamentals and the potential for significant returns.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PFE. Click here to check it out. List of 52-Week LowsList of 3-Year LowsList of 5-Year LowsThe one positive of a declining share price is that the dividend yield can start to look appealing. The combination of potentially high returns and generous yield can make for very attractive total returns.Criteria for Stock SelectionThis article will explore three stocks that meet the following criteria:Share price is down at least 10% since the start of 2023.Have a GF Score of at least 90 out of 100.Rated as undervalued by GuruFocus.Have a dividend yield of at least 3%.Have increased the dividend for at least 10 years.Just 14 stocks meet the above criteria, including Extra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE).Extra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR)First up is Extra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR), a real estate investment trust that operates in the self-storage industry. The trust has a market capitalization of $25.5 billion and has generated revenue of more than $2 billion over the last year. The stock is lower by 16.5% so far this year.Extra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR)s primary competitive advantage is the sheer size of its business. Already the number two largest operator of self-storage stores in the U.S., Extra Space Storage expanded the reach of its business following its recent purchase of Life Storage for approximately $47 billion in an all-stock deal.EXR's Expansion and Dividend YieldThis acquisition added 1,200 new locations to the trusts already sizeable footprint, making it the largest player in its industry. The trust now owns, operates, and develops self-storage locations in more than 40 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. In total, Extra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR)s self-storage locations number more than 3,500.Story continuesExtra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR)s third-quarter dividend payment was split over two distributions due to the terms of the transaction involving Life Storage. The dividend is expected to remain intact going forward, so Extra Space Storages dividend growth streak of 14 years continues. Shares yield 5.3% presently, which is considerably higher than the average yield of 1.6% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.EXR's Performance Metrics and ValuationThe share price may have declined for the year, but Extra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR) performs well on most metrics. The trust has a GF Score of 90 out of 100, implying good outperformance potential. Extra Space Storage receives perfect scores for value and growth and near-perfect marks for profitability. That said, financial strength and momentum are weak.2 Undervalued High-Yield Names for High Total ReturnsThe GF Value Line implies that Extra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR) is significantly undervalued at the moment. With a GF Value of $191.55, investors could see a 59% return if the stock were to reach its GF Value.2 Undervalued High-Yield Names for High Total ReturnsPfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)The second name for consideration is Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), a leading global pharmaceutical company. The company is valued at $181 billion and has generated more than $181 billion of revenue over the last year. Shares are down almost 38% so far this year.Few pharma companies can match the size and scale of Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), as it truly is a global leader. The company has some of the most successful pharmaceutical and vaccines in the world.PFE's Business Strategy and Dividend YieldIt was one of the first companies to bring a Covid-19 vaccine to market, which has greatly aided results in the past few years. However, the demand for vaccines and the anti-viral drug Paxlovid has fallen as the pandemic has eased and usage has dropped, leading to declines on the top- and bottom-lines in recent quarters.That said, Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) used the success of its Covid-19-related business to acquire other companies that can help bolster its pipeline. This includes the 2022 acquisition of GBT for its sickle cell treatments and the 2021 purchase of Trillium for its cancer therapeutics.Even with the roll off of revenue from its Covid-19 treatments, Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) still expects revenue and earnings per share for 2023 to be above pre-covid levels as the core business remains healthy. There are some therapeutics that will lose patent protection, such as Eliquis and Ibrance, that will be a headwind in the years ahead, but the Pfizers acquisition spree and its pipeline should help to offset these losses.The steep decline in share price has caused the yield to reach 5.1%. This is one of the highest yields for the stock in more than a decade. Since 2013, Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)s average yield is 3.6%. Pfizer has also raised its dividend for 14 consecutive years, so the companys dividend growth track record is solid.PFE's Performance Metrics and ValuationPfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)s GF Score is 90 out of 100, suggesting that the stock could see outperformance. This rating is backed by perfect or near-perfect showings for value, growth, and profitability. Financial strength and momentum receive average scores.2 Undervalued High-Yield Names for High Total ReturnsThe GF Value Line shows the stock is significantly undervalued. Shareholders could see a 60% return if the stock were to reach its GF Value of $51.01.2 Undervalued High-Yield Names for High Total ReturnsFinal ThoughtsExtra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) are two examples of companies that have suffered a steep decline even as the market as a whole has rallied this year. Both stocks are down a double-digit percentage, but each company has a sound business model and industry-leading fundamentals. Each stock is also trading well off its intrinsic value, which could mean strong rates of return.At the same time, both stocks offer a 5%+ dividend yield, effectively paying investors to wait for the market to reprice shares. Investors looking for deep value and high yields should consider adding Extra Space Storage Inc (NYSE:EXR) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) to their portfolio.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

A decision on that is expected in December.($1 = 0.9467 euros) (Reporting by Tom Kaeckenhoff, Writing by Rachel More and Ludwig Burger, Editing by Friederike Heine and Ros Russell)]"

Despite this decline, a close examination of its third-quarter 2023 performance reveals a resilient financial backbone and strategic advances in various medical frontiers. It reported a net income of $2.33 billion, a reduction from previous figures, yet simultaneously, a net change in cash showcased an upswing of 169%.Amid the reported figures, Pfizer managed to beat the expected EPS, reporting a surprise of 15%, cementing a foothold in profitability terrain even amidst adverse financial climates.Pfizer's Resilience and Future ProspectsFurther enhancing its enterprise resilience, Pfizer recommenced production at its North Carolina plant post-tornado damage, a swift bounce-back showcasing operational efficiency.

The projected alleviation of the 'tripledemic' threat this season also signals a potentially more stable path ahead for Pfizer in the pharmaceutical landscape.Pfizer's Market PositionPositioned within a competitive industry, Pfizer's revenue of $12.73 billion, although reflecting a decline, and an equity-to-asset ratio ranking lower than 66% of companies in the drug manufacturers industry, doesn't eclipse its growth narrative. The company's 3-year revenue, EBITDA, and EPS without NRI growth rates stand resilient, outperforming more than 76% of industry counterparts.With a forward P/E ratio of 9.75, it continues to be a viable contender in the market, underscoring its sustained ability to generate shareholder value despite prevailing industry headwinds.

This is evident from its latest launch of Tap to Pay on Android for sellers in Canada.Tap to Pay on Android, designed to meet the growing demand for contactless payment, is backed by Square’s software, which offers a smooth and straightforward checkout experience.Tap to Pay on Android allows sellers to accept contactless payments made via a contactless credit card or credit card with a digital wallet seamlessly.With the underlined feature, sellers are not required to bear additional costs for their payment setup. Payments will be easily done through a compatible Android device and the Square point-of-sale app.The feature ensures that sellers never miss a sale and gain more flexibility to use new commerce tools.We believe Square is expected to gain momentum among various sellers in Canada with Tap to Pay on Android. This, in turn, will likely aid growth in the overall seller base of the company as part of the Square ecosystem.In second-quarter 2023, Square ecosystem generated $1.93 billion in net revenues, up 12% year over year. It yielded a gross payment volume (GPV) worth $54.15 billion (91.8% of the total GPV) in the same quarter, up 13% year over year.Our model estimate for 2023 Square ecosystem revenues stands at $7.34 billion, indicating growth of 9.6% year over year.Block, Inc. Price and Consensus Block, Inc. Price and ConsensusBlock, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Block, Inc. Quote Strong Contactless Payment EffortsThe latest move bodes well with Block’s growing initiatives toward offering seamless contactless payment options to its sellers.In addition to Canada, Square launched Tap to Pay on Android for its U.K. retailers in the first half of 2023.Recently, Block formed a partnership with Apple AAPL to integrate the Square Point of Sale (POS) app with the latter’s contactless payment acceptance feature named Tap to Pay on iPhone.Apple’s Tap to Pay on iPhone incorporates Block’s broader ecosystem of tools, which help sellers smoothly start, run and grow their businesses.Sellers with an iPhone and Square POS app will be able to accept in-person contactless payments safely and seamlessly.This apart, Block offers a contactless chip reader, which helps sellers quickly receive money in their bank account by accepting chip cards, contactless NFC (near-field communication) cards, Apple Pay and Google Pay from anywhere.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsThese growing efforts are helping this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expand its presence in the booming contactless payment market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The underlined market is witnessing significant growth owing to rising demand for seamless and faster processing of payments. A surge in digitalization and an increase in online shopping across the globe are acting as key factors.Per a Precedence Research report, the global contactless payment market is expected to reach $132.42 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 16.1% between 2023 and 2032.The abovementioned efforts are also likely to boost Block’s footprint in the digital payment market. A Statista report shows that transaction value in this market is expected to hit $9.5 trillion in 2023 and reach $14.8 trillion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 11.8% between 2023 and 2027.The growing prospects of Square in these booming markets are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock.However, rising competition from some notable players like PayPal PYPL and Shopify SHOP in the digital payment space remains a concern for SQ.Block has lost 29.8% on a year-to-date basis against the industry’s growth of 12.6%.PayPal has been benefiting from its peer-to-peer payment service, Venmo, for a while. Venmo’s improving monetization efforts and its rising adoption rate across various platforms are aiding growth in total active accounts, which is noteworthy. The solid momentum of core peer-to-peer and PayPal Checkout experiences is another tailwind.Shopify is winning merchants regularly owing to its robust product offerings, including Shop Pay and Shop Pay Installments. Checkout using Shopify Payments, which is directly integrated with Google, Facebook and Instagram, enables merchants to sell across these channels easily. This is helping Shopify strengthen its momentum among merchants.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the Big Data industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy Now.Big Data analytics refers to the specialized techniques and technologies used to extract insights and information from large, diverse data sets. According to Fortune Business Insights, the size of the global Big Data analytics industry is set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.5% from 2022 to reach a size of $745.15 billion by the end of this decade. The size of the industry stood at $271.83 billion in 2022. The healthy growth rate reflects the untapped market potential of the Big Data analytics industry. Meanwhile, according to a study conducted by McKinsey Global Institute, Big Data has the potential to contribute an additional $3 trillion in value annually to the global economy due to its application in seven industries. Such significant numbers establish the importance of the industry and the players operating in it, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In addition to the best big data stocks for the long term, investors looking to gain exposure to the Big Data theme can also choose to invest in a Big Data ETF like the Global X Artificial Intelligence &amp; Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) and ProShares Big Data Refiners ETF (NYSEARCA:DAT).Big Data has made tremendous progress in the fields of cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. Research conducted at MIT has concluded that organizations adopting a data-driven decision-making model are expected to experience a 5% to 6% improvement in productivity and output compared to their competitors. Consequently, 92.2% of companies are increasing their investments in the field of Big Data. Key benefits of Big Data analytics include identifying business trends, determining root causes of problems, optimizing marketing campaigns, real-time fraud detection, and offering personalized recommendations. Experts believe that there will be an increasing demand for data analysts, scientists, and other related professionals as the world is witnessing an ever-increasing influx of data with every passing day. By 2025, the world is expected to have 150 billion gigabytes available for exploration and understanding. This figure reflects a 33 times increase in the volume of data and information available for analysis since 2013 when it stood at 4.4 billion gigabytes. According to Armonk, New York-based technology giant International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), the US economy suffers an annual loss of $3.1 trillion due to poor data quality.Story continuesCurrently, some of the primary sources of Big Data include social media posts, digital transactions, sensor data, weblogs, internet searches, and mobile applications. The global proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is anticipated to have a significant impact in the field of Big Data as well. Experts predict that there will be 20 billion IoT devices by the end of this decade that will generate and collect massive amounts of data in various forms like telemetry data, audio, video, and more. Big Data is considered the fuel that powers artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning applications. AI techniques leverage large datasets to ""train"" algorithms and models to perform tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and prediction. Additionally, common machine learning methods like deep learning neural networks require substantial volumes of training data to identify meaningful patterns and relationships. As organizations and researchers accumulate larger datasets, the performance of AI systems improves. This reflects the idea that the growth in Big Data analytics will provide impetus to artificial intelligence and machine learning applications as well. A report issued by Fortune Business Insights on the prospects of the AI industry revealed that the industry is set to expand at a CAGR of 21.6% to reach a size of $2.03 trillion by 2030 as opposed to $428 billion in 2022.  You can also check out the 20 Best-Funded AI Startups in 2023 here.Best Big Data Stocks To Buy NowCarol Gauthier/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe have shortlisted the 13 best Big Data stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”11.

(NASDAQ:DDOG) with an Outperform rating and a target price of $120. The analyst highlighted that the entity has “very strong” net new customer additions and adoption of new offerings as well by existing customers.Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”6. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $3,402,004,900Market Capitalization: $296.72 billionOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has a comprehensive portfolio of products and cloud services for Big Data and analytics. This includes Oracle Big Data Cloud, Oracle Analytics Cloud, and Oracle Exadata Cloud. For data ingestion and processing, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers support for Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, NoSQL databases, and other Big Data technologies. The company highlights successful collaborations with corporations like Deloitte and Exelon, showing how its Big Data platform assists analytics teams in analyzing data to derive valuable insights.Here's what Madison Investments said about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) reported a solid fiscal fourth quarter and provided guidance for the first quarter that continued to support solid growth for the company. Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”In addition to Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet Inc.

The Expectations Index— based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions— declined to 73.7 in September, after falling to 83.3 in August and 88 in July. Notably, any reading of the Expectations Index below 80, historically signals a recession within next year.According to Dana Peterson, the chief economist at The Conference Board, “Expectations for the next six months tumbled back below the recession threshold of 80, reflecting less confidence about future business conditions, job availability, and incomes.""Peterson also said, ""Consumers may be hearing more bad news about corporate earnings, while job openings are narrowing, and interest rates continue to rise — making big-ticket items more expensive.""In a similar kind of study, on Sep 15, the University of Michigan reported that the preliminary Index for U.S. Consumer Sentiment in September dropped to 67.7, missing the consensus estimate of 69.2. The final metric of the Index in August was 69.5.At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option. If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) stocks with a solid dividend yield.

NCR and Agilysys AGYS.Industry: Computers - IntegratedLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2155973/4-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-technology-solutions-industryPlayers in the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry are grappling with lingering supply-chain bottlenecks. A challenging macroeconomic landscape with rising inflation is also a concern. Soaring prices and persistent delays in customer acceptance have resulted in high levels of backlog and cast a pall on the industry's prospects. Nonetheless, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, NCR Corp. and Agilysys are a few industry participants to watch as they are benefiting from the rise in advanced forms of data management, the rapid shift from traditional silos, increased demand for integration of deployment techniques as well as modern application development.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry comprises companies that provide advanced information technology solutions, including computer systems, software, storage systems and microelectronics. These industry players are increasing investments in data modernization and analytics, cyber defense, remote work, automation and contact-less services, customer &amp; employee experience and supply-chain modernization, which accelerate growth in digital transformation services.Some industry participants also provide technological solutions (both products and services) to help organizations connect, interact and transact with customers. Others develop and market information recognition, data entry software, systems and technologies.4 Computer - Integrated Systems Industry Trends in FocusIntegrated Solutions Driving Demand: The industry is benefiting from rising demand for integrated solutions across small, medium and large-scale enterprises as well as increasing investments in IoT, big data, AI and blockchain software technologies. Moreover, business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and security and social businesses present significant opportunities to an increasing number of remote workers in the wake of the coronavirus-induced work-from-home wave. The industry players are anticipated to benefit from recovering global IT spending, as predicted by Gartner.Story continuesSolid Adoption of Multi-Cloud Model: The growing adoption of the multi-cloud model to achieve better scalability and attain improved resource utilization is expanding the scope of industry participants. Cloud and hardware/software virtual technologies are anticipated to favorably impact the industry. As growth and investment opportunities in developed countries continue to slow down, we believe that emerging economies will play a crucial role in the days ahead.Supply-Chain Bottlenecks and Backlogs: Industry participants are witnessing supply constraints, softness in server demand and cognitive applications, as well as delays in customer acceptance. These are resulting in consistent backlog levels, particularly in Compute, High Performance Computing &amp; Mass Storage Class and Storage. Moreover, volatility in foreign exchange — primarily due to the current macroeconomic scenario and headwinds in emerging markets — does not bode well for the industry.Semiconductor Chip Shortage Mars Prospects: Industry participants are facing challenges stemming from the ongoing and time-consuming business model transition to the cloud. Further, lower spending across Data-Center Systems — primarily due to component shortages like memory and CPUs, as well as deceleration in hyperscale spending — is likely to dampen the prospects of industry participants.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #167, which places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group's earnings growth potential. Since Sep 30, 2022, the industry's earnings estimate for 2023 has moved down 14.1%.Despite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching based on a strong earnings outlook. Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry has underperformed the broader Computer and Technology sector and Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has returned 13.7% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500 and broader Computer and Technology sector's respective returns of 16.5% and 28.5%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month P/S, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer-integrated systems stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 1.64X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.71X. It is also below the sector's trailing 12-month P/S of 4.13X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.15X and as low as 1.14X, with the median being at 1.55X.4 Computer-Integrated Systems Providers to WatchInternational Business Machines: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is witnessing solid net sales growth in the software segment driven by healthy hybrid cloud adoption and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation, data in AI and security. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A strong foundation of research and innovation, a broad portfolio that caters to various industry requirements and a diverse global market presence set it apart from its competitors.Synergies from the Red Hat buyout are boosting its competitive position in the hybrid cloud market. The company is likely to benefit from the robust adoption and broad-based availability of IBM Blockchain World Wire — a blockchain-driven global payments network aimed at accelerating and optimizing cross-border payments.IBM is poised to gain from the spin-off of the legacy infrastructure services business as it focuses on a hybrid cloud strategy. However, declining trends in the infrastructure vertical are hurting IBM's top line. Intense competition from other established players like Amazon, Microsoft and Google in cloud services is exerting pressure on margins.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has moved north by 0.2% to $9.43 per share in the past 60 days. IBM's shares are up 1.7% year to date.NCR: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from strong demand for its software and service solutions across digital payments, banking and hospitality industries.The acquisition of Cardtronics strengthened its NCR-as-a-Service strategy, expanded its global footprint and enhanced its automated teller machine (""ATM"") network. Cardtronics' robust debit network will further expand NCR's payments platform and help it connect to retail and bank customers, thereby facilitating customer acquisition.Besides, the company continued to witness the traction of its point-of-sale and self-checkout solutions across food-drug merchandise and convenience-fuel-retail customers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 9.9% in the past 60 days to $3.45 per share. NCR's shares have gained 13.5% year to date.Hewlett Packard Enterprise: It is benefiting from strong executions in clearing backlogs and increased customer acceptance.HPE's multi-billion-dollar investment plan across expanding networking capabilities will help diversify business from server and hardware storage markets, and boost margins over the long run. Also, easing supply-chain challenges will help it clear backlogs rapidly.Hewlett Packard views AI, Industrial Internet of Things and distributed computing as the next major markets.HPE's efforts to shift focus to higher-margin offerings like Intelligent Edge and Aruba Central Hyperconverged Infrastructure are aiding the bottom line.However, organizations are pushing back their investments in big and expensive technology products due to global economic slowdown concerns, which can undermine this Zacks Rank #3 company's near-term prospects.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has moved north by 0.9% to $2.13 per share in the past 60 days. HPE's shares have increased 5.1% year to date.Agilysys: The company is benefiting from steady demand for cloud-native products and supporting software modules, an end-to-end array of software solutions and world-class customer service.Agilysys operates as a developer and marketer of hardware and software products as well as services, with special expertise in select vertical markets, including retail and hospitality in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific and India.This Zacks Rank #3 company's expertise in enterprise architecture and high availability, infrastructure optimization, storage and resource management and business continuity is a major growth driver.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has remained steady at 73 cents per share in the past 60 days. Shares of AGYS have declined 18.1% year to date.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

One such stock that merits attention is The AES Corp (NYSE:AES). The stock, which is currently priced at 15.46, recorded a loss of 2.95% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 22.38%. The stock's fair valuation is $27.3, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AES. Click here to check it out. AES 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AESThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.Is The AES (AES) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe AES Corp (NYSE:AES): Potential Value Trap?However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with The AES Corp (NYSE:AES) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.52. These indicators suggest that The AES, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany Overview: The AES Corp (NYSE:AES)The AES is a global power company. Its current generation portfolio as of year-end 2022 consists of over 32 gigawatts of generation including renewable energy (46%), gas (32%), coal (20%), and oil (2%). AES has majority ownership and operates six electric utilities distributing power to 2.6 million customers. The AES's stock price compared to its GF Value, which is an estimation of fair value, suggests a potential undervaluation despite the associated risks.Is The AES (AES) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapExploring The AES's Low Altman Z-ScoreThe EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of The AES's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.03; 2022: 0.01; 2023: 0.03) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that The AES might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionConsidering the aforementioned factors, The AES Corp (NYSE:AES) may be a potential value trap despite its seemingly undervalued stock price. The company's low Altman Z-Score, coupled with a descending EBIT to Total Assets ratio, suggests possible financial distress. As such, thorough due diligence is crucial before making an investment decision.

206,7b92e605-baad-4b1d-a301-38e31adf269e,GM,2023-09-29,4 Republican myths about green energy,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-republican-myths-about-green-energy-210056946.html,1695934856,STORY,"['STLA', 'TSLA', 'F', 'GM']","[When Yahoo Finance interviewed former Vice President Mike Pence on Sept. 26, he referred to President Biden’s energy policies as the ""Green New Deal.""Biden actually opposed the Green New Deal (GND), which was a fanciful plan hatched by liberal Democrats in 2019 to overhaul the energy and transportation sectors and remake much of the US economy. There was never a chance it would become law, but progressives such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) hoped the GND would serve as a vision document for future efforts to combat global warming.Pence and other Republicans apply the label to Biden because they hope it will tar him with connotations of socialist extremism. Biden has, in fact, signed aggressive green energy programs into law, but they largely rely on tax breaks meant to trigger private investment, not the mandates and government takeovers contained in the Green New Deal.Republicans, nonetheless, seem to think Biden’s green energy agenda is a juicy target as they look for ways to weaken his reelection campaign. Republican front-runner Donald Trump calls the move to green energy a “transition to hell,” while other Republicans blame Biden’s green energy push for inflation, the auto workers' strike, and assorted other woes.As ever, embellishments and lies mingle with reality. Here are four myths Republicans are spinning about green energy:Biden’s policies will force consumers to go green. Trump, for instance, said in Michigan on Sept. 27, that Biden “wants electric vehicle mandates that will spell the death of the American auto industry.” But there are no Biden mandates requiring consumers to do anything. Biden does have a goal, which is to make EVs 50% of all new car purchases by 2030. But he’s trying to accomplish that through incentives such as tax breaks that make EVs cheaper to buy and federal funding to help build a nationwide charging network. If the market doesn’t hit that 50% EV target by 2030, nothing will happen.Story continuesIt's possible automakers will retire gas-powered models in favor of electrics and leave some buyers wanting a gas-powered car that no longer exists. But this can only happen if consumers embrace EVs enough to move the market fully away from gasoline. They may not, forcing automakers to keep a blend of EVs and gassers in their fleets. It’s also true that broad consumer trends often leave out buyers who prefer particular features no longer popular. Some drivers love manual transmissions, for instance, but automakers barely make them anymore because the take rate is so low.Former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses auto workers as he skips the second GOP debate, in Clinton Township, Michigan, U.S., September 27, 2023. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook (Rebecca Cook / reuters)[Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.]There are green energy mandates in some states, where governments are forcing utilities to move away from fossil fuels toward renewables for electricity generation, which can lead to higher prices for retail consumers. Biden has proposed a rule requiring sharp cuts in carbon emissions at power plants nationwide by 2035. The Supreme Court struck down a similar rule the Obama administration tried to impose, and the Biden rule is sure to face litigation if or when a final version goes into effect. Energy consumers who want to stay brown will be able to do so for a long time.About the death of the US auto industry... It’s not happening any time soon — especially if you include all the non-unionized workers at Tesla and the many foreign automakers that have factories in the United States. Trump told the workers in Michigan that “they want to go all-electric and put you all out of business."" Yet US auto-industry employment has been rising, even as virtually every carmaker has begun shifting to electrics. Since the post-COVID recovery began in mid-2020, the number of automotive jobs has risen to nearly 1.1 million, about 60,000 more than the peak under Trump.The huge green energy package Biden signed into law last year includes powerful incentives to build more factories in the United States, not fewer. And there is, in fact, an unprecedented boom in US factory production, which will be followed by even more factory hiring as those plants come online. A new US “battery belt” is forming as factories pop up to supply the new components EVs will need. There could even be new mining operations as companies tap needed minerals, such as lithium from a huge deposit in Nevada.There’s no guarantee new green energy jobs will be unionized, and that’s something the striking auto workers hope to address with General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. But the Biden green energy laws also contain added incentives for domestic projects that pay union-level wages. Trump gave his Michigan speech at a non-union automotive plant, and Republicans in general don’t support unions. So if it sounds like they’re bashing green energy to show solidarity with the union cause, don’t buy it.Biden’s policies benefit China. If Biden did require Americans to buy EVs and other types of green energy products, with no incentives to boost domestic production, then it probably would benefit China, which has a more robust renewable energy supply chain and lower costs than the United States does. But reshoring green energy production is one of the main goals of the Biden policy, and the claim about China winning is only plausible if you accept the first two bogus arguments.We can just go back to oil and gas. Most of the Republican presidential candidates say they’ll trash Biden’s green energy agenda and reemphasize oil and gas development if they become president. That would be foolish for two reasons, even if you put aside the need to address global warming.First, the whole developed world is moving away from carbon and developing new green energy technologies. This is a multitrillion-dollar opportunity, and everybody is not going to participate equally. First-movers will lock in vast amounts of wealth, innovation, employment, and other benefits, as they always do. The race is still on. Biden’s green energy plan is a counterbalance to government incentives in China, Europe, and elsewhere aimed at keeping the spoils there.Second, private-sector firms are now investing hundreds of billions of dollars in green energy development in the United States, in part because of the lucrative incentives Biden has signed into law. Would a Republican president really cancel all those incentives and tell green energy firms to fire their workers and mothball their plants because we’re going back to fossil fuels? That’s basically what Republicans are promising to do. We’ll have oil and gasoline for a long time, but that doesn’t mean we have to be the last ones clinging to it.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Workplace Culture Strategist and Speaker Jennifer Moss explains how worker empathy and loss of trust in employers are fueling the United Auto Workers' (UAW) demands for certain concessions to be recognized.""The most frustrating part for... a lot of the folks that are striking right now, and why they're striking, is that they were made promises to... play a role in helping these large organizations — huge, big companies — be able to weather the financial crisis,"" The Burnout Epidemic author explains. ""And so what's happened is... they don't feel like the promises have been delivered. And that reduces trust, that makes people say 'what's the point? why am I doing this?'""Moss also comments on overall work stoppage and unionization trends across the labor force.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- These companies would certainly argue look we are a publicly traded company, we have a duty here to shareholders. So we're talking about just cold hard numbers here. Where does empathy play a role in all of this?JENNIFER MOSS: It plays a significant role when we look at the fact that the last few years have been really difficult, and that people are feeling exhausted, high levels of burnout, the highest level of mental health disability claims, and then particularly in this sector, we're seeing extreme high levels of exhaustion and depletion. And when you looked at the turnover in the workforce last year, 41% of the global workforce turning over, reshuffling, leaving. The number one reason was lack of empathy and care from my employer. So it's a big reason why people leave, and it also plays a role in why people stay.- And we are seeing a little bit of ground, perhaps being made according to a report by Bloomberg, saying that the UAW is targeting at least a 30% pay raise versus the 40% that they were pushing for. So there does seem to be perhaps a little bit of leeway if the UAW ends up confirming this report. But what do you think corporate America then is missing in this discussion about really making up for a lot of the concessions that really started back when the big three were bailed out during the financial crisis?Story continuesJENNIFER MOSS: Well, I think the most frustrating part for a lot of the folks that are striking right now and why they're striking is that they were made promises to play a role in helping these large organizations, huge big companies be able to weather the financial crisis. And so what's happened is that they haven't been-- they don't feel like the promises have been delivered. And that reduces trust. That makes people say, what's the point? Why am I doing this? And when you bring in things like the four-day workweek, for example, it seems like it was a really extreme request.But it's more to manage the fact that people are not feeling like there's loyalty or a reason for being there. And they want to have different kinds of compensations other than just pay. Pay is a priority, but they also want other types of concessions when it comes to their mental health and well being.- Jennifer, you could argue the environment right now within the labor market has helped gain leverage to employees. Obviously, a tighter labor market means they have a little more negotiating power. To what extent though, do some of these demands-- to what extent is a Union necessary for that? I mean, we're talking specifically about the UAW strike, but this concern about higher wages, better benefits, more safer employees, that's not exclusive to the UAW.JENNIFER MOSS: No, it's not. But we are seeing record numbers of work stoppages. I mean, it's just astronomically increased since even pre-pandemic. But in the last year, we're seeing this increase in unionization. And a reason for that and why we see that increase is if you look historically over time, is that employers are not listening to their employees and feel like they can take advantage of that. And we know there's a tighter labor market and some employees are getting what they need. But when you have a sector that-- again, for a long time, hasn't seen those pay raises, has not seen those promises delivered, they are going to require or need or need to lean on a body like a Union to be able to preserve those rights.And that's why you're seeing, again, the writer strike and lots of different kinds of unionization activity happening. And instead, we could prevent a lot of this if we were just listening and being empathetic and finding out what our employees needed before it had to hit these kind of catastrophic responses.]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.7 billion, suggesting a rise of about 6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 65 cents per share, implying a decline of 5.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. McCormick has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.2%, on average.Factors to NoteMcCormick has been grappling with cost inflation for a while now. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the adjusted gross margin was partly hurt by escalated cost inflation. Further, SG&amp;A expenses increased year over year due to elevated employee incentive compensation expenses and increased distribution costs.McCormick also witnessed a spike in brand marketing costs in the second quarter. It expects an even greater year-over-year rise in brand marketing costs in the third quarter, which is likely to increase the company’s SG&amp;A expenses.Moreover, MKC anticipates a significant rise in interest expenses in fiscal 2023. It expects interest expenses in the band of $200-$210 million in 2023, which is likely to be spread evenly throughout the year. Interest-related items are likely to dent bottom-line growth by 800 basis points in 2023. In 2023, management also expects its adjusted effective tax rate (of 22%) to serve as a 100-basis point headwind to the company’s earnings growth. These factors raise concerns for the third quarter.However, a focus on saving costs and enhancing productivity through the company’s ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program and the Global Operating Effectiveness (“GOE”) program bodes well. McCormick expects savings from its GOE program to scale up as fiscal 2023 progresses. It expects savings from the GOE program to have an 800-basis point impact on adjusted operating profit growth in fiscal 2023.Savings from the CCI program are likely to be $85 million in fiscal 2023. Such cost savings, coupled with effective pricing actions, are likely to have worked well for the company in the quarter under review. Additionally, brand strength, backed by innovation and acquisitions, has been a driver.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for McCormick this time.

The program is unique in that it provides a secure landing place for program participants while they complete their service to the nation and work toward meeting all United hiring requirements. United 737 Captain and LAX Assistant Chief Pilot, Kenneth “KP” Kirkpatrick, served more than 12 years on active duty in the U.S Air Force. KP joined United a decade ago as a First Officer. Today, he leads from the flight deck while still serving our nation as a Lt. Colonel and Commander of the 729 Airlift Squadron in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.Under the terms of the new program, successful candidates must first take part in an interview and then complete all required flight training and certification prior to joining the airline. An important element of United's program is that candidates don't need to hold an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate (ATP) at the time of application. Instead, they can obtain their ATP before joining United – providing flexibility for service members, including starting at United when the time is right for them and their families.""At United we are committed to investing in individuals who have served and are serving our country – whose military skills and background are invaluable to our airline,"" said Scott Kirby, United CEO. ""Launching this program is a win-win: our airline gets direct access to some of the best, most talented aviators in the world, and military pilots – and their families – get the time they need to plan their civilian career while still serving.""Interested active-duty military pilots can learn more about the United Military Pilot Program and apply for the program here. Current or former military pilots who already meet United's mainline hiring requirements and are less than six months from availability, or already available, or are flying in the reserve component are encouraged to apply as a First Officer today. Story continuesCurrently, United has over 16,000 pilots, including over 3,000 who have served or currently serve in the United States Armed Forces. United employs nearly 7,700 military veterans and 1,500 actively serving personnel across various departments and functions, including many serving in leadership and executive positions.""As a former military pilot, I know firsthand how challenging it can be to transition to a civilian commercial pilot, but through this new program we're providing the necessary tools, resources, and support system to ensure a direct path to the United flight deck,"" said United Captain Michael Bonner, Managing Director of Aviate and Pilot Strategy and a former U.S. Air Force and Navy pilot. ""Whether you are an active-duty pilot or approaching retirement, I encourage you to join the largest widebody fleet in the U.S.""Other defined paths to the United flight deckOn top of the United Military Pilot Program, there are multiple paths to becoming a pilot at United depending on flight experience: First Officer Hiring: This path is for experienced pilots who meet mainline hiring requirements, who are ready to fly for United now and do not need an alternate path or program.United Aviate program: United's pilot career development program designed for pilots with their Private Pilot Certificate (PPL) who are either learning to fly or are building experience with an Aviate-participating university, flight school, Part 135 operator or United Express carrier. United Aviate Academy: United's wholly-owned flight school in Goodyear, Arizona for aspiring aviators who want to learn to fly with little to no flight experience – with the goal of at least half of the students being women or people of color.Unprecedented GrowthAs part of the carrier's ambitious United Next plan, last December, United ordered more widebody aircraft than any U.S. carrier in commercial aviation history: 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners with options to purchase 100 more. Combined with already announced orders, the airline expects to take delivery of about 700 new aircraft by 2032.With this historic purchase comes unprecedented growth, including adding 50,000 new team members by 2026. Hiring well-qualified and talented pilots is a priority at United. Over the last 24 months, United has hired over 4,000 new pilots and expects to hire over 10,000 pilots this decade.

The cargo doors on some planes are too small to easily get a motorized wheelchair in the belly of the plane.The airline also agreed to refund the fare difference if a passenger has to take a more expensive flight to accommodate their wheelchair.United said it expects to make the changes by early next year.The settlement, dated Wednesday, followed a complaint filed by Engracia Figueroa, who said her custom-made wheelchair was damaged on a United flight in 2021.Figueroa died three months later, and family members and her lawyer blamed sores, skin grafts and emergency surgery on sitting for five hours in a manual wheelchair that did not fit her body.Paralyzed Veterans of America and other groups have cited Figueroa's death as they push for new federal regulations to increase accessibility on airline planes.According to the settlement, airlines mishandled 32,640 wheelchairs and scooters on domestic flights from 2019 through 2022 — a rate of 1.45%. United and its United Express partners had a slightly better rate of 1.2%, third best among airlines tracked in the Transportation Department's monthly consumer report on air travel.The department said reports of damaged and delayed wheelchairs and scooters are consistently among the top five disability complaints it gets about airlines.As part of the settlement, United said that later this year it will start a trial at George Bush Houston Intercontinental Airport to accommodate passengers whose wheelchairs are damaged or delayed, including reimbursing people for transportation if they don’t want to wait at the airport.]"

The discount retailer watched its profits slide in 2022 due to a combination of inflation, deep price cuts and excessive inventory, and though its performance is better this year, it still faces numerous headwinds. Now Target is closing stores in a several major U.S. markets due to what it calls “organized retail crime.”I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here Are 5 Stocks I’m Never SellingDiscover: 8 Best Cryptocurrencies To Invest In for 2023In a Sept. 26 press release, Target said it will shutter nine stores across four states, effective Oct. 21.

The retailer has suffered significant losses due to theft and damage, known as “shrink” in the industry. This doesn’t make Target unique — Walmart, Macy’s, Best Buy, Walgreen, Home Depot and Dick’s Sporting Goods are among the other national chains warning about the impact of theft.Story continuesOrganized retail crime has become such a problem in the industry that the National Retail Federation has devoted an entire page to it on its website, saying that retailers are “highly concerned about the heightened levels of violence and threat of violence associated with theft and crime.”The NRF describes organized retail crime as  the “large-scale theft of retail merchandise with the intent to resell the items for financial gain.” It typically involves a “criminal enterprise employing a group of individuals who steal large quantities of merchandise from a number of stores and a fencing operation that converts the stolen goods into cash.”Target is the first major retailer to specifically cite crime as a reason for closing multiple stores.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. At the start of the year, there was a lot of excitement surrounding tech stocks. However, as investor sentiment shifted, other types of investments gained attention. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell by 5.32% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date returns to 27.09%, as of September 28. During uncertain times, investors prefer dependable stocks to earn a steady income and maintain their financial stability.Dividend stocks are often considered relatively stable investments compared to some other types of stocks, particularly those that do not pay dividends. When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn their attention to companies that regularly grow their dividends. Steady and consistent dividend increases indicate that a company is financially strong. This can also assist investors in creating a portfolio that consistently generates high dividend income over time. In our article titled 14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now, we referred to Hartford Funds data and mentioned that companies that either raised or started paying dividends since 1973 have achieved the best returns compared to other stocks. These returns were achieved with less price fluctuations. During this time, dividend growers and initiators provided a 10.24% return, while companies that reduced dividends returned 3.95% to shareholders.Dividend stocks can provide income even when the broader stock market is experiencing declines, which can help investors ride out challenging market conditions. In addition to this, these equities, especially those from established companies, tend to have lower volatility compared to growth stocks, which can experience more significant price swings. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, during the 1970s, a period known for both high inflation and sluggish economic growth, dividends accounted for 70% of the overall returns investors earned. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade in which total returns were negative. Dividend returns of nearly 2% helped offset the negative price returns caused by events like the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis, providing a cushion for investors.Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowWhile dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, have not performed as well as the overall market this year, analysts are optimistic about the potential for these stocks to perform better in the remaining part of the year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”11.

Like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT), Costco observed weaker trends in discretionary items as it enjoyed strong grocery sales. While Walmart, Target, and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) complained of retail theft pressuring their profit margins and thinning their bottom lines, Costco has its own answer to theft and organized retail crime which is not a big issue for the membership-based warehouse retailer, even without having the scan-and-go technology like the on that the e-commerce titan, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) has.Quarterly HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on September 3rd, Costco made $78.9 billion in revenue that rose 9.4%, beating consensus estimates from LSEG’s consensus estimate of $77.9 billion expected. The membership-based warehouse club earned a net income of $2.2 billion, or $4.86 per share, topping expectations of $4.79 and improving from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to $1.87 billion, or $4.20 per share. Comparable sales expanded 1.1% YoY,  yet only 0.2% in the U.S.But while Walmart and Target are growing their online sales, Costco’s e-commerce sales contracted 0.9% YoY as consumers pull back on online sales items such as furniture, small electronics and jewelry due to elevated costs of living.Observed TrendsShoppers turned to the membership club for groceries but bought fewer big-ticket item. Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti stated that shoppers came more often but spent less with the result being softer sales of pricier items in the U.S., outside of the food category.The amount of an average transaction dropped nearly 4% across the globe, while falling 4.5% in the U.S. Global traffic rose 5.2% and 5% YoY in the U.S.MembershipsSince Covid-19 entered our lives, Costco benefited as Americans cooked more from home and millennials moved to suburban areas which come with bigger pantries. Additionally, inflation made consumers sign up and renew their memberships at Costco, Walmart-owned Sam’s Club and other retail clubs. At the end of the quarter, Costco gathered 71 million paid household members, which translates to almost an 8% YoY rise with 32.3 million paid premium, so-called, executive memberships, also increasing from previous quarter’s 981,000. The premium memberships now make over 45% of paid memberships while contributing to about 73% of total sales. When asked about an increase in membership fee, Galanti replied that it is a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’, but did not specify when that will occur.Story continuesCostco Does It In Its Own WayThe bottom line is that Costco continues to post impressive financial figures in a struggling environment without complaining about theft unlike Walmart and Target, stating that inventory shrinkage has not dramatically increased during the past year. Costco’s identity is not made of embracing every trend as it is known for moving carefully. It will not be following all the footsteps of Amazon nor it will be adding express aisles. Costco is aware that inventory shrunk increased due to rollout of self-checkouts that are present at limited locations, but fortunately, shrink rose less than 0.01 percentage point over the past year.Unlike Amazon, Walmart and Target, people pay to be able to shop at Costco and they do it to take advantage of its pricing. But Costco is also making changes and improving its app, only quietly, but they already resulted in a 46% YoY rise in Costco app installs with unique visitors to the site rising 40% YoY. Although one could never mistake Costco to be Amazon, Costco has never even tried to be the tech-savvy Amazon or even Walmart. Costco, the warehouse club made its own identity and one that is a perfect fit for challenging times like these.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

One such stock that merits attention is Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA). The stock, which is currently priced at $8.57, recorded a gain of 6.99% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 34.69%. The stock's fair valuation is $25.4, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with MARA. Click here to check it out. MARA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MARAThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Marathon Digital Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.47. These indicators suggest that Marathon Digital Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.The Altman Z-Score ExplainedBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesIntroduction to Marathon Digital HoldingsMarathon Digital Holdings Inc focuses on mining digital assets. It owns cryptocurrency mining machines and a data center to mine digital assets. The Company currently operates in the Digital Currency Blockchain segment. The Company's Cryptocurrency Machines are located in the United States. Despite its current stock price, its GF Value is estimated at $25.4, suggesting a potential undervaluation. However, a deeper analysis is required to understand the potential risks associated with this investment.Is Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapMarathon Digital Holdings's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Marathon Digital Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Marathon Digital Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The first factor we need to consider is a measure of short-term liquidity. This is calculated as the working capital divided by total assets. When we evaluate the data provided: 2021: 0.01; 2022: 0.00; 2023: 0.00, it's clear that Marathon Digital Holdings has experienced a declining trend in its Working Capital to Total Assets ratio over the past few years. This decline suggests potential liquidity issues that the company may be facing. The ratio is strikingly low, which unfavorably influences the overall Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Marathon Digital Holdings's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: -0.06; 2022: -0.13; 2023: -0.38) indicates a recent dip following an initial rise. This reduction suggests that Marathon Digital Holdings might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.Concluding ThoughtsDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) poses significant risks that investors should not ignore. The company's low Altman Z-Score and declining financial ratios suggest potential liquidity issues and operational inefficiencies, indicating that the company could be a potential value trap. As always, thorough due diligence is essential before making any investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

239,6fbe3113-d45a-36be-8474-19d82a6d7652,VZ,2023-09-29,Verizon Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC) Celebrates 20th Anniversary,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-threat-research-advisory-center-130000904.html,1695906000,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCNEW YORK, Sept. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cybersecurity Awareness Month kicks off next week, and with the continued rise in cyberthreats worldwide, for businesses to help protect their assets, they need a fail-proof security architecture, and the expert insights and partner to help stay ahead of bad actors. For the past two decades the Verizon Threat Research Center (VTRAC), a specialized division within the company’s cyber security consulting organization, celebrating 20 years, has been at the forefront in the battle against cyberthreat actors.VTRAC was established in 2003 with the mission to help organizations build thorough and effective incident response plans. The organization has expanded over the course of its history to 200+ VTRAC team members in over 150 countries, including investigators, forensic lab technicians, intelligence analysts and data scientists. Members are professionals with military, law enforcement and/or IT expertise who are well-versed in criminal and civil investigative requirements.“Though much has changed in the field of cybersecurity in the last 20 years, VTRAC’s mission remains the same: Help our customers regain control of compromised assets and defend against data breaches within their networks,” said Chris Novak, Managing Director of the Verizon Threat Research Advisory Center.The visibility that Verizon’s network provides is striking, with more than 600 incidents investigated and more than 29 trillion raw logs analyzed last year. VTRAC boasts six global digital forensic laboratories and nine security operation centers across the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa.“Having a global presence and drawing from a breadth of experience across sectors gives VTRAC a fuller understanding of today’s security threats,” said Novak, “Cyber threats vary across industries as do the regulatory and compliance challenges in different countries. Knowing how those components interweave is critical to staying on top of evolving threats that are global in nature.”Story continuesVTRAC’s capabilities have expanded over the years to match the advancements in technology, the rise of connected devices and the ability of cybercriminals to access sensitive data. Today, those services include digital forensics, breach investigations, incident response, penetration testing, red teaming, network security and payment security. The division also tackles tricky governance, risk and compliance issues, and engages in deep and dark web hunting.“Twenty years ago, IoT devices didn’t truly exist,” said Novak. “We had to do our work on-site in physical environments, which drew out the process and limited our visibility. Today, the average home has almost two dozen IoT devices. It’s about speed and intelligence. You want to catch incidents before they become larger events, and you want to use your analytics to anticipate and thwart future threats.”VTRAC also supports customers and the broader business community in their cybersecurity journey by providing valuable insights for business and government operations and fellow cybersecurity industry leaders. Its flagship report, the Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), now in its 16th year, has become a go-to authority on the state of cybersecurity globally. Other key reports produced on a regular basis for industry leaders are the Payments Security Report and the Mobile Security Report, among others.For Cybersecurity Awareness Month, the VTRAC team has authored “Patch Me If You Can,” a series of six blog posts on the many cybersecurity threats and prevention methods in six different industries:Financial servicesHealthcareManufacturingMedia and EntertainmentRetailSmall to Midsize Businesses“A big part of defending against cyber attacks is being aware of the threats,” said Center for Internet Security Executive Vice President &amp; General Manager, Security Best Practices, Curtis Dukes. “We take advantage of our network’s broad visibility to conduct research from which we glean insights that we turn into reports, articles and other content. Our aim is to give our customers and other businesses a clear view of the threats they face and a blueprint of how to prepare and respond.”VTRAC is a globally approved PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI) with more than 300 cybersecurity certifications.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Today According to Media.Constant bombardment of news and making decisions based on day to day market updates gives a false sense of knowledge which often distracts investors and distorts their long-term outlook. When we examine the investment philosophies of those who made it while investing in the stock market, we notice a common theme: successful investors and billionaires don’t give in to the temporary pressures and keep their horizons vast and outlook wide.For example, Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the most famous hedge funds and billionaires, often talks in detail about his journey in the investing world. There was a time he used to spend hours and hours analyzing a stock based on its fundamentals and then present his research report to his bosses. But Druck learned a lesson: he has to look at the factors that actually cause a stock price go up or down. Druckenmiller said many investors, even the experienced ones, don’t have a clue what makes their stocks rise and fall.Staying disconnected from the short-term news cycle does not mean at all that you don’t pay attention to the important market forces at work. For example, the Federal Reserve is currently in a wait and see more when it comes to inflation. The central bank controls the most important lever in the economic system: credit/money. Coincidentally, Druckenmiller has been extremely vocal about the importance of liquidity and he’s been talking about the importance of paying attention to the central bank’s moves for years. Druckenmiller once said:""The major thing we look at is liquidity, meaning as a combination of an economic overview. Contrary to what a lot of the financial press has stated, looking at the great bull markets of this century, the best environment for stocks is a very dull, slow economy that the Federal Reserve is trying to get going… Once an economy reaches a certain level of acceleration… the Fed is no longer with you… The Fed, instead of trying to get the economy moving, reverts to acting like the central bankers they are and starts worrying about inflation and things getting too hot. So it tries to cool things off… shrinking liquidity… [While at the same time] The corporations start having to build inventory, which again takes money out of the financial assets… finally, if things get really heated, companies start engaging in capital spending… All three of these things, tend to shrink the overall money available for investing in stocks and stock prices go down…""Story continuesIn this backdrop, it’s important to see which stocks are currently cheap and have the potential to rebound once the economy comes out of the volatility and uncertainty.Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to MediaOur MethodologyFor this article we consulted at least 10 mainstream and credible financial news media outlets and compiled a list of stocks that were repeatedly labeled as cheap and undervalued by financial news media.Cheap Stocks to Buy Today According to Media13. Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Several media outlets we consulted believe Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) is an undervalued stock. In August Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) posted second quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $0.14, beating estimates by $0.05. Revenue in the quarter jumped 32.7% year over year to $1.09 billion, surpassing estimates by $80 million.As of the end of the second quarter, 26 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC).12. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in August said that Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP)’s performance has been weak over the past few months amid growth concerns but he believes this weakness could be temporary. Goldman Sachs also named Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) among its list of stocks that could see potential growth catalysts in the coming months. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) will announce Q3 results in October and analysts will be watching the company’s AI-related progress or announcements.A total of 29 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) as of the end of the June quarter.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“SNAP shares were our top detractor for the quarter on its July decline from weaker revenue growth relative to guidance (which had been reduced in May) and the fact that management did not provide an outlook for 3Q. Shares subsequently rebounded somewhat as the company announced better-than-expected near-term revenue growth, while announcing a broadbased cost restructuring.Although the company continues to face near-term macro headwinds and difficult year-over-year comparisons from COVID-fueled quarters last year, we believe SNAP can reaccelerate its revenue growth to greater than 20% annually over the next several years. With TTM revenue of $4.5 billion (as compared with Meta’s $120 billion), 347 million daily average users (about 1/10 of Meta’s), and $14 TTM ARPU (about 1/3 of Meta’s), we believe SNAP has a long runway for both revenue growth and expanded profitability as it improves its platform functionality, continues to grow its audience (daily active users continue to grow at a double-digit rate), and expands its monetization.”11. Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB)’s PE ratio as of September 20 stands at 14.85.A total of 29 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds were long Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB). The biggest stakeholder of Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) during this period was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns a stake worth over $90 million.In its fiscal Q4 earnings call Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB)’s management talked about future expectations and said:""As we think about the phasing for the year, we expect the first quarter adjusted earnings growth rate to be the lowest of the year due to the concentration of higher inflation, increased marketing and selling expenses, the highest quarter impact from lower pension income and some costs related to a nonmaterial cyber incident. As you know, we don’t provide quarterly guidance. Given the unique dynamics in Q1, however, we expect first quarter adjusted EPS likely in the upper $0.80 range with momentum building as the year progresses. As I wrap up guidance, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 4.7% of net sales. Our priorities for fiscal 2024 include select capacity expansion projects, including the recently announced Goldfish investment, our headquarter consolidation and other programs to support our Snacks margin improvement plan as well as important IT and productivity investments.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.10.

Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Human capital management and payroll software solutions company Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) ranks 9th in our list of the cheap stocks to buy according to media.

That included this quarter’s greatest detractor, Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY). A provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software for medium-sized organizations, Paylocity reported revenues, earnings, and forward guidance that were higher than anticipated. The company won new clients, which combined with cross selling and higher employment levels at existing clients added to Paylocity’s growth. However, it seemed that Paylocity was caught by negative market sentiment for either employment-related stocks or high growth software, and its shares retreated by -19%. That was counter to our view on its fundamentals, so we added to Paylocity on that weakness.”8. VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40VICI Properties Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. At the start of the year, there was a lot of excitement surrounding tech stocks. However, as investor sentiment shifted, other types of investments gained attention. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell by 5.32% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date returns to 27.09%, as of September 28. During uncertain times, investors prefer dependable stocks to earn a steady income and maintain their financial stability.Dividend stocks are often considered relatively stable investments compared to some other types of stocks, particularly those that do not pay dividends. When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn their attention to companies that regularly grow their dividends. Steady and consistent dividend increases indicate that a company is financially strong. This can also assist investors in creating a portfolio that consistently generates high dividend income over time. In our article titled 14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now, we referred to Hartford Funds data and mentioned that companies that either raised or started paying dividends since 1973 have achieved the best returns compared to other stocks. These returns were achieved with less price fluctuations. During this time, dividend growers and initiators provided a 10.24% return, while companies that reduced dividends returned 3.95% to shareholders.Dividend stocks can provide income even when the broader stock market is experiencing declines, which can help investors ride out challenging market conditions. In addition to this, these equities, especially those from established companies, tend to have lower volatility compared to growth stocks, which can experience more significant price swings. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, during the 1970s, a period known for both high inflation and sluggish economic growth, dividends accounted for 70% of the overall returns investors earned. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade in which total returns were negative. Dividend returns of nearly 2% helped offset the negative price returns caused by events like the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis, providing a cushion for investors.Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowWhile dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, have not performed as well as the overall market this year, analysts are optimistic about the potential for these stocks to perform better in the remaining part of the year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”11.

French newspaper Challenges and the Wall Street Journal identified the company as Nvidia .Nvidia and the FCA declined to comment.WHY IS NVIDIA IMPORTANT?Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that break down a computer task into smaller pieces and processes them together, making it faster than traditional methods.The GPUs are highly sought by technology companies for their data centres, by video game console makers and even by bitcoin miners to solve the complex math puzzles and earn more cryptocurrencies.Nvidia has a near-monopoly of the GPU market with 84% market share, leagues ahead of rivals Intel and AMD. With a market valuation of $1 trillion, Nvidia is also becoming crucial to fast-developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology.Almost all computing systems used to power services like ChatGPT - OpenAI's blockbuster generative AI chatbot - use GPUs from Nvidia.While GPU prices start from over $1,000, the ones favoured by AI companies can cost well over $10,000. Specialized AI systems from Nvidia such as DGX A100 start at $199,000, or the price of four Tesla Model 3s.Oracle, for example, said it has been spending billions of dollars on Nvidia chips.WHY IS FRANCE INTERESTED?The FCA earlier this year issued a report on the competitive functioning of the cloud computing sector.It was looking at the market dominance of cloud companies such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft and whether their market dominance affect competition.Story continuesIn that report, the authority also highlighted that several developments, such as large language models and cloud gaming, would potentially have an impact on the competitive functioning of the sector.Nvidia has a presence in both sectors, and if any startup is planning to create an AI company, they would need to depend on Nvidia for the chips.The FCA carried out an unannounced visit and seizure at the premises after authorisation from a judge. Whether the company implemented anti-competitive practices could only be established by an investigation on the merits, it said.""In terms of next steps after the initial raid, there will most likely be court proceedings against the raid itself and the order of the judge having authorised the raid,"" said Charlotte Colin-Dubuisson, antitrust and foreign investment partner at law firm Linklaters.In France, this is a separate proceeding before court, and can have an impact on the FCA's case if the raid and/or the order is invalidated, Colin-Dubuisson said.IS THE FCA INVESTIGATING OTHERS?Various French authorities have looked at Big Tech companies previously, including issuing a fine to Google in 2021 for infringing EU competition law.The FCA is examining whether the competitors of big cloud companies are facing any obstacles.The authority has tools to protect competition under the law of abuse of a dominant position, the law of cartels, abuse of economic dependence and concentration control, and the law on restrictive competition practices.It also thinks that some market failures would likely be addressed by regulations currently under discussion, such as the proposed EU Data Act.

ECL is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its focus on research and development (R&amp;D). The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance, along with its strong business, is expected to contribute further. Compliance risks and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 15% compared with a 16.5% rise of the industry and 17.7% growth of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services provider has a market capitalization of $47.85 billion. It projects 12.8% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain a strong performance. Ecolab’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Focus on R&amp;D: Ecolab’s R&amp;D program consists principally of developing and validating the performance of new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of those already existing, improving service program content, evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support. Management believes continued R&amp;D activities are critical to maintaining its leadership position within the industry and will provide it with a competitive advantage as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers.Strong Business: Ecolab’s consistent delivery of considerable earnings growth despite the current challenging business environment continues to impress. Ecolab witnessed a strong second-quarter 2023 performance, which reflected continued robust organic sales growth, operating income margin expansion and growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Per management, pricing in the quarter remained strong, sustained by carryover from last year and further new pricing.Management also stated that its focus on new business and penetration generated share gains and value pricing and productivity drove strong margin recovery during the quarter.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Ecolab’s solid second-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company registered a robust year-over-year uptick in its top and bottom lines, along with solid performances across all segments. Strong pricing momentum and steady overall volume were also recorded. The company’s digital capabilities, innovation and global service expertise are expected to lead to robust new business wins, which are encouraging.DownsidesCompliance Risks: Ecolab’s business is subjected to various laws and regulations relating to the environment, including evolving climate change standards and the conduct of its business. Compliance with these laws and regulations exposes the company to potential financial liability and increases operating costs.Data Security Threat: Ecolab relies, to a large extent, upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate its business. The size and complexity of the company’s information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to failure, malicious intrusion and random attacks. Acquisitions have resulted in further de-centralization of systems and additional complexity in its systems infrastructure.Estimate TrendEcolab is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 2% north to $5.09.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.98 billion, suggesting an 8.4% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, McKesson Corporation MCK and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.DaVita, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. At the start of the year, there was a lot of excitement surrounding tech stocks. However, as investor sentiment shifted, other types of investments gained attention. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell by 5.32% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date returns to 27.09%, as of September 28. During uncertain times, investors prefer dependable stocks to earn a steady income and maintain their financial stability.Dividend stocks are often considered relatively stable investments compared to some other types of stocks, particularly those that do not pay dividends. When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn their attention to companies that regularly grow their dividends. Steady and consistent dividend increases indicate that a company is financially strong. This can also assist investors in creating a portfolio that consistently generates high dividend income over time. In our article titled 14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now, we referred to Hartford Funds data and mentioned that companies that either raised or started paying dividends since 1973 have achieved the best returns compared to other stocks. These returns were achieved with less price fluctuations. During this time, dividend growers and initiators provided a 10.24% return, while companies that reduced dividends returned 3.95% to shareholders.Dividend stocks can provide income even when the broader stock market is experiencing declines, which can help investors ride out challenging market conditions. In addition to this, these equities, especially those from established companies, tend to have lower volatility compared to growth stocks, which can experience more significant price swings. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, during the 1970s, a period known for both high inflation and sluggish economic growth, dividends accounted for 70% of the overall returns investors earned. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade in which total returns were negative. Dividend returns of nearly 2% helped offset the negative price returns caused by events like the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis, providing a cushion for investors.Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowWhile dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, have not performed as well as the overall market this year, analysts are optimistic about the potential for these stocks to perform better in the remaining part of the year.

The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”11.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)In a case with strong parallels to C.H. Robinson vs. Miller and the case known simply as Ye, an Illinois appellate court has removed a 3PL from a more than $18 million decision against a carrier whose truck struck a teenager in 2016.The Appellate Court for the 1st District of Illinois removed 3PL Alliance Shippers from the verdict handed down in the case of Francine Cornejo vs. Dakota Lines (the carrier), Gordon Lewis (the driver) and Alliance. Cornejo is the mother of Gustavo Cornejo, a minor at the time who was with his father on the side of the road in Sauk Village, Illinois, when he was struck by a truck driven by Lewis, who was hauling auto parts for Dakota Lines. Gustavo Cornejo suffered significant injuries.In December 2021, a jury ruled against Dakota, Lewis and Alliance and awarded Francine Cornejo, on behalf of her son, $18,150,750.Alliance appealed the verdict, arguing that as the 3PL that booked Dakota, it could not be held liable.As a case in state court, Alliance could not invoke the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act that C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) in the Miller case, GlobalTranz in the Ye case and Landstar (NASDAQ: LSTR) in the stolen cargo case involving “a guy named James” had cited in federal courts. They had argued that the act’s trucking provisions protected the 3PLs from liability in cases involving theft and injuries. C.H. Robinson did not prevail in its argument; GlobalTranz and Landstar ultimately did.The inconsistency in the decisions raises the possibility that the U.S. Supreme Court will be asked to review the cases, which the court already chose not to do in an attempt by C.H. Robinson.The decision in the Alliance case was handed down by a unanimous three-judge panel Wednesday.Alliance argues that the trial court erred by refusing to grant Alliance a judgment “n.o.v.,” because Alliance was not vicariously liable for Lewis’ negligence “since neither Lewis nor Dakota were Alliance’s agents,” the panel wrote. “We agree.”Story continuesAn online definition of n.o.v. is “notwithstanding the verdict.” It is further defined as “reversal of a jury’s verdict by the trial judge when the judge believes there was no factual basis for the verdict or it was contrary to law.”The appeals panel, citing precedent, said an n.o.v. judgment is handed down in “limited cases where all the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent, so overwhelmingly favors the movant [party making the motion] that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand.”Much of the panel’s decision was driven by its conclusion about the control that 3PL Alliance had over carrier Dakota, and by extension its driver, Lewis. The question, it said, is whether Lewis and Dakota were “agents” of Alliance or an independent contractor.The evidence in the Cornejo case “overwhelmingly favors Alliance by showing, as a matter of law, that Lewis and Dakota were not agents of Alliance” and had proved it so thoroughly that “no contrary verdict based on that evidence can stand” — language similar to the precedent the court had cited. If the decision is that they were agents of Alliance, the outcome would be different, the court implied.The panel checked off numerous facts about the relationship between Dakota and Alliance to support its argument. “Alliance did not pay Dakota’s drivers and withhold taxes from their pay; hire, train or fire the drivers; dispatch or speak to the drivers; control the drivers’ routes or provide them with tools, equipment, or materials; or own the tractors or trailers the drivers used,” it wrote. “It is undisputed that Dakota and Alliance adhered to the terms of their agreement, which provided that Dakota had full control over its personnel and would perform services as an independent contractor. Moreover, Dakota and Alliance did not have an exclusive relationship; Dakota was free to haul freight for other brokers and was not Alliance’s primary carrier. Dakota hired, trained and fired its drivers; paid them; and withheld taxes from their paychecks.”Marc Blubaugh, a partner with the Benesch law firm who has written and spoken about the Robinson case and others, told FreightWaves in an email that the Alliance decision was significant.“Recall that the primary theories of liability pursued by plaintiffs against brokers are: (1) a negligence claim based on the decision to use/hire the specific motor carrier and (2) a vicarious liability claim based on the amount of ‘control’ being exercised by the broker over the motor carrier and its driver,” Blubaugh wrote, noting that the “control” question is what attorneys for Cornejo pursued against Alliance.“The more court decisions like this that illustrate what an insufficient degree of control looks like, the better the environment becomes for brokers across the country,” he said.The panel noted that the plaintiff’s expert witness, Professor Carl Berkowitz, argued that there was control and cited several contract provisions between Dakota and Alliance, which had a long-standing relationship.But the court rejected those claims, saying that what Lewis — the driver — did had “no bearing on the issues [Cornejo] asked Berkowitz to review concerning control, and Berkowitz did not analyze the relationship between Lewis and Alliance in forming his position.”The court did cite the testimony of Gary Blom, a vice president at Dakota, who testified that Dakota was an independent contractor for Alliance and was “not Alliance’s agent for any purpose.” Dakota was free to work with other brokers, and its drivers were not instructed by Alliance on how to handle the shipments, Blom testified.The verdicts against Dakota and Lewis were not impacted by the appellate court decision. They were not parties to the appeal.More articles by John KingstonTruck parts supplier FleetPride holds on to speculative debt ratingsTruck drivers accessing BNSF facilities reach settlement in Illinois digital fingerprinting lawsuitTFI subsidiaries hit with EEOC lawsuit over gay workersThe post Broker dodges liability in $18M verdict, had no ‘control’ over carrier appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Recent Activist Investor Campaigns.It's never a dull day in the markets with activist investors deploying all kinds of strategies in the race to unlock and maximize hidden value in highly undervalued stocks. Since 2017, campaigns by activist investors that purchase minority stakes and push for strategic changes have been on the rise. While the activism eased during the Covid 19 pandemic, they have increased in recent years with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the opening up of the global economy.The impact of activist investors is growing in the US and worldwide, depicted by a tidal wave of campaigns spread far and wide. Often referred to as corporate raiders, activist investors acquire minority stakes in companies they feel are trading below their fair value. They buy stakes to influence management, operations, and policies to try and unlock any hidden value.Activist investor's ultimate goal is to improve the performance and value of the companies they invest in. Consequently, they use tactics not limited to public campaigns or private negotiations. In extreme cases, they engineer proxy fights calling for management changes and seats on the board in the race to influence policies.Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman, Nelson Peltz, and Daniel Loeb are some of the notable names called in the same breath with the biggest activist campaigns. The corporate raiders have been on a roll in recent years, with most engineering campaigns on stock valuations tanking at the height of the pandemic. In the race to pursue strong financial returns and strategic accountability, investors are increasingly taking on executives they feel are underperforming.Activist's campaigns were on a roll in 2022, buoyed by tumbling markets that provided a leeway for activist investors to target stocks that had plunged significantly. More than 900 companies were targeted by activist investors, up 6% from 2021.Story continuesIn the first quarter of 2023, 69 new activist campaigns were the second-highest number since 2019. By the end of the year’s first half, there were about 850 campaigns, much higher than the 762 campaigns recorded in the first half of 2022. Additionally, 85% of the campaigns had an ESG component, with corporate governance the most common theme.Stocks in the consumer goods industry remain the most targeted as they play host to larger companies with low debt levels and strong cash generation prospects. Their scale often offers activist investors a reason to push for cost-cutting and divestments, operational improvements, and adoption of new technologies.Activist campaigns targeting financial institutions surged by more than 60% in the first half of the year as the banking crisis was escalating in the US. However, the scrutiny eased as the half came to an end amid improving fundamentals.In the first half of the year, activist campaigns targeting the Technology sector stood at 25%, followed by Industrial at 21% and Healthcare at 13%. The campaigns were vast and concentrated on companies with a market capitalization of above $10 billion at 24% of the campaigns. A good number of the campaigns also came with M&amp;A demands. On the other, activism has increased in the Utilities sector amid deteriorating performance on concerns about the economy. The health services sector has not been spared either.The increase in activist campaigns came with a new trend dubbed swarming that involves pursuing campaigns in companies already targeted by activists. Some of the companies targeted as part of the new strategy included salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (NYSE:BAYRY), and Seven &amp; i Holdings.15 Recent Activist Investor CampaignsSource:unsplashIn addition, activist campaigns used to be more relaxed than they were. In the past, the corporate raiders would take a strong stand and fight through a proxy contest. The companies are listening to shareholders more and engineer board nominations to influence policies. Proxy fights and lawsuits appear to have taken a back seat.In recent years, activist investors have also been looking into Europe as a more attractive market, which explains why the region accounted for the lion's share of new campaigns. While there was a 34% decline in activist campaigns early in the year in the US, there was a 30% increase in Europe. Activist investors are increasingly targeting large European companies offering greater growth and returns potential.Despite the uncertainties in the global markets amid monetary policy disparity and recession risks, activist investors continue to push companies with the number of global campaigns holding above the four-year average.Our MethodologyActivist campaigns are always cropping as institutional investors like hedge funds scan the market for undervalued stocks that can generate significant returns once strategic alternatives are triggered. We have compiled a list of the most recent activist campaigns an ranked them based on when they occurred.15. Trian Partners at The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Activist Campaign: February 2023The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was the subject of an aggressive activist investor campaign early in the year over claims it was in crisis for shedding more than $120 billion in market value in 2022. Trian Partners was the lead activist investor pushing for strategic changes at the entertainment company to try and maximize shareholder value.Trian Partners’ Nelson Peltz started making the case for replacing Michael Forman in the media and entertainment conglomerate. Trian, which held $1 billion worth of stakes in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), did not spell out reasons for its call.However, a back and forth between the activist investor and the company would end after Disney delivered a raft of business initiatives, including plans to reinstate dividends by the end of the year. Trian dropped its campaign after the announcement.14. Third Point at SiriusPoint Ltd. (NYSE:SPNT) Activist Campaign: April 2023SiriusPoint Ltd. (NYSE:SPNT) is a company that offers insurance and reinsurance products and services for various lines worldwide. It's been targeted by activist investors, the most recent being from Third Point, which owns a 9% stake in the company valued at about $1.4 billion.The activist investor considered taking the insurance company private as one of the ways of unlocking shareholder value. However, the activist investor could not reach an agreement with SiriusPoint Ltd. (NYSE:SPNT), hence pulling back on any deal.13. Politan Capital at Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI)Activist Campaign: May 2023Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI), a monitoring technologies, automation, and connectivity solutions company, has been targeted by Politan Capital, which holds a 9% stake. The activist investor kicked off a proxy battle in May with the aim of fixing what it dubbed as broken corporate governance.The investor cited the $5 billion drop in market value after the company reached a deal to acquire audio company Sound United for $1 billion. Politan Capital also raised concerns about Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI)'s capital allocation and board oversight.In addition, the activist investor has taken issue with what it terms an unfocused strategy, therefore calling for management change. The size of the CEO and founder employment agreement also aggrieved it.The proxy battle would come to an end after shareholders voted in favor of the hedge fund nominees to the board. The activist investor has since put the activism aside, opting to work from inside to try and unlock value.12. Elliot Management at Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Activist Campaign: May 2023After a turbulent 2022 that saw Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) come under pressure, it would catch the attention of activist investor Elliot Management at the turn of the year. The activist investor started pushing for strategic alternatives that it felt would impact the company's fortunes.The hedge fund started pushing for its own candidates in the company as one of the largest shareholders with stakes valued at billions of dollars. Nevertheless, the push for board seats would only last a short time as Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) delivered impressive Q4 results, prompting the hedge fund to reconsider its stance. In a joint statement, it emerged Elliott Management won't be pursuing its director nomination, averting a potential proxy fight.11. Carl Icahn at Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN)Activist Campaign: May 2023Carl Icahn, an activist investor, has launched a fierce proxy fight with Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), a company that makes and sells life science tools and integrated systems.Early in the year, Icahn accused the board of poor oversight, especially with regard to the acquisition of cancer test maker Grail for $7.1 billion.Icahn's resistance to the deal stems from Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN)'s decision to close it without approval from antitrust regulators in the US and Europe. The activist investor embarked on a campaign urging the company to unwind the absurd and questionable deal. He also called for the CEO to step down while pushing for board seats.The activist investor garnered enough support in May to oust the biotech company's board chair, John Thompson, in May. However, CEO Francis DE Souza survived the chop from the nine board members. Icahn also ended with three seats on the board.10. Jana Partners at Freshpet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRPT)Activist Campaign: May 2023Freshpet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRPT), a company that manufactures and sells natural fresh meals and treats for dogs and cats, has been the subject of a fierce activist investor campaign. Jana Partners has been pushing for aggressive changes at the company after acquiring stakes when the company's stock dropped by 74% last year.At the time of the investment, the activist investor felt the company was mismanaged and needed management and board changes. Consequently, it waged an activist campaign that resulted in the firm gaining four seats on the board in May, which it is using to advocate for changes.Jana Partners has been pushing for changes in how the company allocates capital and its corporate governance. The appointment of four directors leaves it in a solid position to supervise capital expenditures and position it for a possible sale.9. CAS Investment Partners at Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDLX)Activist Campaign: June 2023Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDLX) is a company that operates as an advertising platform in the US and the UK.

To avert a fierce proxy battle, the company reached a voting agreement that saw Jana's managing partner, Scott Ostfeld, appointed to the board. With the agreement, Jana Partners also agreed to support any Mercury Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRCY) incentive plan amendments.7. Cannell Capital at Sportsman’s Warehouse Holdings, Inc.

The hedge fund also proposed five people to be nominated as a replacement. Discussion between the firm and the company broke down on May 5 as Cannell Capital dubbed the proposed agreement as too restrictive.The proposed agreement required the hedge fund to offer support to all board measures over the next two years in exchange for appointing a nominee.6. Legion Partners Asset Management at OneSpan Inc. (NASDAQ:OSPN)Activist Campaign: August 2023OneSpan is a company that designs, develops, and markets digital solutions for identity authentication. The company is the subject of an activist campaign by investment firm Legion Partners Asset Management, which believes the company is going in the wrong direction.The firm has since written a letter to the company; making it known it is not happy with the push to pivot away from growth and pushes to focus on cash flow optimization and capital returns. The hedge fund believes the proposed changes are a distraction to the company's bid to achieve fair value for shareholders.Therefore, it is calling on management to focus on committing 30% off plus adjusted margins for earnings before interest taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It also wants the company to increase its capital returns by more than $ 50 million and pursue a possible sale of the company.Click to continue reading and see 5 Recent Activist Investor Campaigns.Suggested articles:30 Low Cost Business Ideas With High Profit12 Best Global ETFs to Buy15 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Under $5Disclosure: None. 15 Recent Activist Investor Campaigns is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:DIS) on an initial climb. Yet, even as the industry basks in the newfound resolution and promise, a more complex narrative unfurls for the company.Despite the fleeting surge, Disneys financial saga over the past year is marred with a 19.62% descent in stock price, a dip that whispers of financial trials beneath the surface of the media giants expansive empire.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISDisney's diverse portfolio, ranging from streaming services to parks and experiences, contributes to its multifaceted financial scenario. The meticulous scrutiny facilitated by the GuruFocus screener elucidates the disparate performance across segments, each wielding its impact on the companys overall financial stability.Streaming services struggleDisney+, one of the leading streaming services, faces a daunting landscape despite a hefty subscriber base. Recording over $500 million in operational losses in the recent quarter, the platform's financial struggle is palpable. Although predictions suggest profitability by fiscal 2024's end, potential investors should view this with a discerning eye. An intricate blend of competition, operational losses and shifting consumer preferences might significantly delay this profitability turnaround.Adding to the uncertainty is Disneys decision to elevate the prices for its ad-free tier, coupled with a reduction in content expenditure. This tactic could alienate subscribers, triggering a possible decline in subscriber retention and growth. The financial repercussions could be substantial, casting further doubts on the company's overall revenue growth prospects. This strategy's ramifications should be a critical consideration for potential investors, warranting close monitoring in the coming quarters.Story continuesAmidst these challenges, Disney+ faces staunch competition from platforms like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), further narrowing its path to financial victory. Disneys position compared to industry leaders reflects a pressing need to revise and revitalize its strategy. A relentless pursuit for subscriber growth and revenue enhancement is paramount to counteract the prevailing financial strain and foster long-term stability and profitability.Parks and experiencesConversely, Disney's Parks, Experiences and Products division emerges as a beacon of hope. The latest quarter revealed a promising increase in revenue and operating income, highlighting the segments potential financial resilience. The international performance, particularly in China, contributes significantly to Disneys diversified revenue base, offering a semblance of financial stability amidst the streaming segment's turmoil.Notwithstanding this positive outlook, Disneys decision to double its parks investments to $60 billion has been met with mixed reactions. While aiming to amplify the parks' appeal and revenue, this substantial investment raises concerns regarding its impact on the companys overall financial positioning. The heightened expenditure underscores the necessity for efficient and profitable operation to ensure a favorable return on investment.Disneys international market performance is commendable. The steady revenue influx from these markets underscores the company's potential to navigate the current financial challenges successfully. However, consistent growth and global expansion are crucial to maintaining and enhancing this revenue stream, mitigating the financial pressure from other struggling segments.Financial overviewIn fiscal year 2023, Disney encountered significant financial fluctuations. Further, the company's stock experienced a sharp decline of -19.62% over the past year, reflecting the overall bearish movement of the market.Despite a 3.84% boost in revenue, amounting to $22.33 billion in its latest financial report, Disney posted a net income loss of $460 million, representing a drastic year-over-year decrease of 132.65%. The diluted earnings per share followed the same downward trend, falling to a loss of 25 cents per share, a year-over-year decline of -132.47%. Additionally, the net profit margin sat at -2.06%, revealing a significant -131.45% year-over-year change.Despite these concerning figures, certain aspects of Disney's financial performance did show signs of improvement. The company reported an operating income of $2.73 billion, marking an 11.57% increase year over year. Moreover, the net change in cash stood at $1.06 billion, a significant 437.58% growth, demonstrating the company's robust cash flow capacity. In June, Disney also managed to beat the earnings per share projections by 7.52%, reporting earnings of $1.04 per share against the expected 97 cents.However, in terms of cash-to-debt and equity-to-asset ratios, Disney's position remains comparatively weak, ranking worse than 74.08% and 52.09% of companies in the media - diversified industry, respectively. This scenario illustrates Disneys financial vulnerability and reliance on leverage, reflecting potential risks for investors. Further, the three-year earnings per share without NRI growth rate is -34.6%, positioning it worse than 84.79% of companies in the industry. Despite these challenges, Disney maintains a relatively strong operating margin of 8.49%, ranking it better than 66.80% of companies in the same sector.OutlookWhile the sagging share price might be alluring, the unresolved difficulties in Disneys streaming operations and accompanying financial hurdles demand meticulous assessment. The advancements in other segments should not overshadow the imperative for a critical evaluation of the streaming division's performance.Potential investors must embark on a comprehensive investigation, weighing the promising prospects against the prevailing challenges. This balanced approach will facilitate informed investment decisions, mitigating unforeseen financial risks and ensuring a judicious investment path.Looking ahead, the emphasis should remain on Disneys continuous efforts to bolster its streaming operations and financial profile. This focus is pivotal to enhancing its competitive stance and achieving long-term growth, stability and profitability in the multifaceted media industry.TakeawayIn conclusion, while the allure of investing in a powerhouse like Disney may seem tempting, especially amidst the recent upswing following the resolution of the Hollywood writers strike, the financial indicators highlighted by the All-in-One Screener suggest a path fraught with uncertainty.Despite segments of potential growth and an undoubted robust legacy, the current terrain unveils significant losses, a shrinking net profit margin and a striking year-over-year stock decline.The future chapters of Disney's financial saga remain unwritten, and while opportunities for growth and revitalization undoubtedly linger on the horizon, the journey forward requires a steadfast and discerning approach.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

265,aa716af6-34de-30c0-921a-59b7f3fb0efe,DIS,2023-09-29,Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Returns On Capital Not Reflecting Well On The Business,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disneys-nyse-dis-returns-140014507.html,1695909614,STORY,['DIS'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Walt Disney is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.044 = US$7.7b ÷ (US$204b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Thus, Walt Disney has an ROCE of 4.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Entertainment industry average of 11%. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney roceIn the above chart we have measured Walt Disney's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Walt Disney Tell Us?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Walt Disney doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 18% over the last five years. However it looks like Walt Disney might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, Walt Disney is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And in the last five years, the stock has given away 30% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Walt Disney   you'll probably want to know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 7/10Growth rank: 2/10GF Value rank: 3/10Momentum rank: 5/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Exelon Corp the GF Score of 64 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Exelon Corp: A SnapshotExelon Corp, with a market cap of $37.81 billion, serves approximately 10 million power and gas customers at its six regulated utilities in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, and Washington, D.C. The company has reported sales of $19.89 billion and an operating margin of 17.75%.Exelon Corp (EXC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisExelon Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.22 positions it worse than 75.46% of 432 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt.Story continuesThe company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.72, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 5.34, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 65.24% of 443 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Exelon Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -18.2 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 96.91% of 486 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market.Over the past five years, Exelon Corp has witnessed a decline in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The three-year growth rate is recorded at -13.8, while the five-year growth rate is at -5.5. These figures underscore potential challenges in the company's profitability.Lastly, Exelon Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Exelon Corp (EXC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Exelon Corp has a rich history in the Utilities - Regulated industry, its current financial and growth indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its historical performance.

Quiniones, CEO of ComEd. ""This competitive award will help accelerate the growth of all-electric vehicles across northern Illinois, which will in turn improve air quality in our communities, particularly those most impacted by pollution, and bring us closer to achieving our climate action goals.""The DOE’s C2C program supports community-driven projects – which include involvement from utilities, local governments, national lab experts and community partners – to drive solutions focused on the electrification of transportation, buildings and industry. ComEd is teaming up with CMAP, RHA, Argonne and Oak Ridge national laboratories to leverage regional climate expertise and leadership to research and inform new strategies to support added transportation electrification in the area, which can further address air quality issues stemming from pollution, while also working with experts to study the impact of increasing transportation electrification on the grid.Story continues""With our partners, CMAP will be able to better inform its work around regional climate action planning to establish transportation emission reduction targets. And most importantly, help our region attain its climate goals and substantial health benefits for our communities,"" said CMAP Executive Director Erin Aleman.Over the next three years, ComEd and its grant partners will conduct research and modeling to better understand the types and the scale of action needed to lower carbon emissions in the transportation sector. This multidisciplinary project will also help develop strategies beyond electrification, like promoting different modes of travel.""Reducing air pollution from motor vehicles will benefit everyone who breathes—not just people living with asthma and other chronic lung diseases,"" said Joel Africk, President and CEO of Respiratory Health Association. ""The positive impact of this project will be felt throughout the Midwest, and particularly in poorer communities where vehicular traffic is disproportionately heavy.""Nationwide, transportation is now the largest single source of planet-warming gases, and transportation accounts for 32% of northeastern Illinois’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, further complicated by the Chicago region’s role as a freight and logistics hub. Recent studies reveal that the transition to electric vehicles in Illinois has the potential to provide significant health benefits, with RHA finding as many as 400 premature deaths in Illinois each year due to air pollution from diesel engine emissions alone.""Argonne is excited to provide the scientific expertise for C2C, which holds great potential to empower a more sustainable Chicago region,"" said Argonne Director Paul Kearns. ""Our research is driving decarbonization in transportation and many additional sectors, and we look forward to continuing to collaborate with ComEd and our other partners. Together, we're opening new frontiers for America's clean energy future.""Expanding electrification is a critical action to help meet federal climate goals, set forward by the Biden-Harris administration, to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Illinois has also embraced policies to help address the impacts of climate change and improve air quality, with the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act calling for 1 million EVs on the roads by 2030 and significantly reducing emissions by 2050.""The Department of Energy and partner national laboratories developed the C2C program to help communities achieve their clean energy goals,"" said Johney Green, associate laboratory director for Mechanical and Thermal Engineering Sciences at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which manages the C2C program for DOE. ""ComEd’s participation in C2C supports the community’s role as primary decision makers throughout the project and ensures that they can select a pathway forward with confidence in partnership with their utility.""With demand for EVs and electrification on the rise, ComEd is helping individuals, families and businesses take advantage of new, all-electric technologies that are demonstrated to lower pollution, enhance air quality, and generate net savings for customers using them. ComEd’s three-year, $231 million investment in electrification, finalized earlier this year, sets forward various customer programs and incentives designed to help remove barriers to electrification, with a goal of accelerating EV adoption and charging availability across the region. ComEd also recently teamed up with regional partners, the Illinois Green Alliance and Elevate, to launch the new Building Performance Hub, an effort to advance sustainable building practices, and also supported by the DOE.

The distributed and decentralized cloud architecture enables Akamai to achieve a low-latency globally scalable design and expand its cloud computing network to key data-intensive connection points that enable customers to bring improved connectivity and experience to end users.The choice of locations for opening the fresh core compute regions speaks volumes of a well-orchestrated game plan to strengthen its footprint in places of strategic importance. While Amsterdam is home to the second-largest Internet exchange in the world, Los Angeles is deemed a leader in the global media and entertainment market. Sao Paulo and Miami are considered to be prime locations for facilitating improved connectivity in Latin America.

274,82cc0a4c-0e5c-3cb3-a5f5-37d13e006bdd,CL,2023-09-29,"Oil prices muted after slide from 2023 highs, still set for Sept gain",Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-muted-slide-2023-210439770.html,1695935079,STORY,"['DX', 'DX-PC', 'CL', 'UCO', 'SCO', 'CL=F', 'GC=F']","[Investing.com - Crude prices fell on the last trading day of September on growing uneasiness over how the world might cope in the coming months with exploding energy costs, even as the U.S. economy and inflation appeared to have escaped the worst of such impact right away. Those long oil also won big on the month and quarter, helped largely by chokes on Saudi and Russian supply.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for delivery in November settled at $90.79 per barrel, down 92 cents, or 1%, on the day.While WTI fell on the day, it rose 0.8% on the week, resuming its rally from the end of August after a one-week hiatus last week. For the month, the U.S. crude benchmark rose 8.5%, making September its best since July’s gain of nearly 16%.The July-September period, where WTI rose 26.5%, also marked the best quarter for the U.S. benchmark since the first three months of 2022. Then WTI traded as high as $130 a barrel as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine opened the way for Western sanctions on Moscow that began the long-running disruption in global commodity flows. Now, WTI is within striking range of triple-digit pricing, reaching a 13-month high of $95.03 on Sept. 28.London-traded Brent for the most-active December contract settled at $92.20 a barrel, down 90 cents, or 1%, on the day. The global crude benchmark rose 0.3% on the week, 6.8% on the month and 23% for the quarter. The global crude benchmark reached a 10-month high of $95.35 on Sept. 28.“After an amazing week, month and quarter, oil was ready for some profit-taking,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Energy traders quickly realized this wasn't the time for oil to rally above the $100 a barrel level, so they are cautiously locking in some profits.”Oil prices have gained between $25 and $30 from May lows of beneath $64 for WTI and $72 for Brent. The rally was largely in response to cumulative production squeezes of at least 1.3 million barrels per day by Saudi Arabia and Russia. The two say they are trying to “balance” the market — though the reality is they are creating a supply deficit so great versus stagnant demand that prices would have no choice but to rise.Story continuesThe two prime movers of OPEC+ — an alliance which bands the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with 10 independent oil producers steered by Russia — have also benefited from tacit collusion on output from U.S. oil producers.While antitrust laws forbid U.S. energy companies from participating in OPEC-like schemes that are against the spirit of free-market competition, American oil firms, lured by the Saudi bent in getting a barrel back to above $100, have restrained production too whenever possible in the name of returning cash to shareholders.The Saudis, Russians and rest of OPEC+ will meet again next week to review the impact of their production cuts on the market and what to do going forward.Demand for U.S. crude has, meanwhile, exploded internationally as it begins to fill some pockets underserved by the Saudi-Russian squeeze. That has led to a plunge in inventory levels at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that serves as a central delivery and storage point for U.S. crude. This is especially so with the pick up in shipments of a new U.S. crude grade called WTI Midland — which is comparable to the viscosity of the heavier Arab and Russian oils versus the typically light-grade that’s WTI.Analysts: Overbought oil market needs to correctOANDA’s Moya isn’t the only one who thinks the oil rally will have to cool with the global economy.Reuters' market analyst John Kemp says oil traders have placed so many bullish bets on crude prices that the trade has become overcrowded and was due for a correction.In his latest column on oil buying among institutional traders, Kemp pointed out that over the past four weeks, traders had bought a total of 183 million barrels of crude and fuel futures. That has brought the total up to 525 million barrels. More importantly, the ratio of bullish to bearish bets on oil and fuels had risen to almost 8:1.According to Kemp, this is a sign that oil prices may start reversing their gains before too long.Others, however, anticipate even higher prices, with JP Morgan saying this week that Brent could reach $150 per barrel. Other commodity analysts see Brent hitting $100 before this year's end.But Wall Street’s forecasters are often too caught up in chasing a market one way that they ignore counteracting forces. And one of the bigger risks to the oil rally remains the Federal Reserve and its higher-for-long regime for U.S. interest rates.Energy-driven inflation, economic worries ahead for Q4Fed Chair Powell told a news conference last week that energy-driven inflation was one of the central bank’s bigger concerns.The Fed has raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023, adding a total of 5.25 percentage points to a prior base rate of just 0.25%. It could add another quarter point in November or December and more likely in 2024.U.S. Treasury yields, benchmarked to the U.S. 10-year note, shot to fresh 16-year highs on Thursday, on expectations over Fed hikes. That bond market selloff could do the oil rally in ultimately, say analysts.The US Dollar Index remained stubbornly at around 106 on Friday — adding to the weight on gold — after a 10-month high of 106.84 on Wednesday.The dollar has been little changed despite latest inflation data that raised hopes that the Federal Reserve might extend its hold on interest rates at its November policy meeting. The Personal Consumption Expenditure Index, a price gauge closely followed by the Fed, rose 0.4% last month, just below Wall Street expectations for a 0.5% rise.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil dips at September close but wins big on month and quarterFactbox-US government shutdown: agriculture data hitQuebec in talks with battery, auto makers for C$15 billion in EV-related investments]"

This saw the consumer confidence of Americans ebbing further in September.The decline in consumer confidence in September was largely triggered by the Fed’s hawkish stance as it hinted at another interest rate hike this year. Markets have since been volatile and are expected to remain so for an extended period.Given this situation, investing in defensive stocks like ALLETE, Inc. ALE, Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO, American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK, Kimberly-Clark Corporation KMB and Colgate-Palmolive Company CL should be safe.Consumer Confidence DeclinesThe Conference Board said on Sep 26 that the Consumer Confidence Index declined to 103 in September from an upwardly revised 108.7 in August, to hit a four-month low as higher prices and inflationary pressures raised fears of a recession. Analysts had expected the index to come up with a reading of 105.5.The decline in confidence of Americans also reflects growing worries about higher interest rates and the current political environment. The United States faces the threat of a government shutdown on Saturday. This saw the confidence of consumers across all age groups taking a hit in September.Moreover, a sharp decline in how consumers perceive future business scenarios clearly signals their feeling of helplessness regarding an upcoming economic downturn.In September, the Expectations Index, the assessment of the short-term economic situation, income and labor market conditions, fell to 73.7 after declining to 83.3 in August.A reading below 80 is a level that historically signals an upcoming recession within a year.Although inflation has more than halved over the past year, it still is more than double the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The Fed thus maintained its hawkish stance and signaled at another interest rate hike this year.Story continuesThe central bank has increased interest rates on 11 occasions by 525 basis points since March 2022, barring in June and September. Another quarter percentage point would take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, a lot higher than the earlier forecast of 5.1%.Also, the Fed lowered its forecast for rate hike cuts to two from four next year. This is likely to further dent consumer confidence as higher interest rates for a longer period do not bode well for the economy.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors such as consumer staples, and utilities. Also, these stocks belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1).

(NYSE:URI). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on United Rentals’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for United Rentals What's The Opportunity In United Rentals?Good news, investors! United Rentals is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $565.20, but it is currently trading at US$448 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, United Rentals’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will United Rentals generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. United Rentals' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 26%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since URI is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on URI for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy URI. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the Big Data industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy Now.Big Data analytics refers to the specialized techniques and technologies used to extract insights and information from large, diverse data sets. According to Fortune Business Insights, the size of the global Big Data analytics industry is set to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.5% from 2022 to reach a size of $745.15 billion by the end of this decade. The size of the industry stood at $271.83 billion in 2022. The healthy growth rate reflects the untapped market potential of the Big Data analytics industry. Meanwhile, according to a study conducted by McKinsey Global Institute, Big Data has the potential to contribute an additional $3 trillion in value annually to the global economy due to its application in seven industries. Such significant numbers establish the importance of the industry and the players operating in it, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In addition to the best big data stocks for the long term, investors looking to gain exposure to the Big Data theme can also choose to invest in a Big Data ETF like the Global X Artificial Intelligence &amp; Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) and ProShares Big Data Refiners ETF (NYSEARCA:DAT).Big Data has made tremendous progress in the fields of cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. Research conducted at MIT has concluded that organizations adopting a data-driven decision-making model are expected to experience a 5% to 6% improvement in productivity and output compared to their competitors. Consequently, 92.2% of companies are increasing their investments in the field of Big Data. Key benefits of Big Data analytics include identifying business trends, determining root causes of problems, optimizing marketing campaigns, real-time fraud detection, and offering personalized recommendations. Experts believe that there will be an increasing demand for data analysts, scientists, and other related professionals as the world is witnessing an ever-increasing influx of data with every passing day. By 2025, the world is expected to have 150 billion gigabytes available for exploration and understanding. This figure reflects a 33 times increase in the volume of data and information available for analysis since 2013 when it stood at 4.4 billion gigabytes. According to Armonk, New York-based technology giant International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), the US economy suffers an annual loss of $3.1 trillion due to poor data quality.Story continuesCurrently, some of the primary sources of Big Data include social media posts, digital transactions, sensor data, weblogs, internet searches, and mobile applications. The global proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is anticipated to have a significant impact in the field of Big Data as well. Experts predict that there will be 20 billion IoT devices by the end of this decade that will generate and collect massive amounts of data in various forms like telemetry data, audio, video, and more. Big Data is considered the fuel that powers artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning applications. AI techniques leverage large datasets to ""train"" algorithms and models to perform tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and prediction. Additionally, common machine learning methods like deep learning neural networks require substantial volumes of training data to identify meaningful patterns and relationships. As organizations and researchers accumulate larger datasets, the performance of AI systems improves. This reflects the idea that the growth in Big Data analytics will provide impetus to artificial intelligence and machine learning applications as well. A report issued by Fortune Business Insights on the prospects of the AI industry revealed that the industry is set to expand at a CAGR of 21.6% to reach a size of $2.03 trillion by 2030 as opposed to $428 billion in 2022.  You can also check out the 20 Best-Funded AI Startups in 2023 here.Best Big Data Stocks To Buy NowCarol Gauthier/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe have shortlisted the 13 best Big Data stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds. The companies selected have substantial exposure to the Big Data industry through various business operations. The Big Data analytics stocks have been listed in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2023.Best Big Data Stocks To Buy Now13. Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $1,507,300,100Market Capitalization: $24.40 billionSplunk Inc.

The analyst was impressed with the depth of the software platform offered by International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).Here's what Diamond Hill Capital said about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”11.

The company recently announced a $3 billion investment, which includes doubling their data and AI workforce to 80,000 to address this growing opportunity.”10. MongoDB, Inc.

Though it is still early days in terms of adoption, Snowflake saw workloads for data science, machine learning, and AI use cases grow more than 90% year-over-year in its most recent quarter.”8. VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $9,018,082,300Market Capitalization: $72 billionVMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) has developed the VMware Big Data Extensions (BDE), which adds enterprise-grade features to open-source Big Data platforms.

(NASDAQ:DDOG) with an Outperform rating and a target price of $120. The analyst highlighted that the entity has “very strong” net new customer additions and adoption of new offerings as well by existing customers.Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”6. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Value of Hedge Fund Holdings: $3,402,004,900Market Capitalization: $296.72 billionOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has a comprehensive portfolio of products and cloud services for Big Data and analytics. This includes Oracle Big Data Cloud, Oracle Analytics Cloud, and Oracle Exadata Cloud. For data ingestion and processing, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers support for Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, NoSQL databases, and other Big Data technologies. The company highlights successful collaborations with corporations like Deloitte and Exelon, showing how its Big Data platform assists analytics teams in analyzing data to derive valuable insights.Here's what Madison Investments said about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) reported a solid fiscal fourth quarter and provided guidance for the first quarter that continued to support solid growth for the company. Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”In addition to Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet Inc.

Since 1969 when the iconic brand was first introduced to the world with the original NERF ball, dozens of iterations of NERF have been created across consumer products categories from sports items to blasters and much more. What started with a simple NERF foam ball more than 50 years ago comes full circle through the cutting-edge competitive sport, NERFBALL.Now, fans can watch NERFBALL’s exciting and heart-pounding combination of paintball-style play with the speed and agility of basketball, all combined with buzzer beating shots and unbelievable highlight moments that took place at the first NERFBALL tournament on September 22, 2023, at the IMG Academy in Florida. Donald Driver, one of football’s all-time leading receivers, dance competition champion and best-selling author, captained a stacked team of talented athletes including Isaiah Elohim, Jada Williams, Jessica Gardner, Kiyan Anthony, Sofia Chepenik and Trace Young. In opposition, ""Out of Darts"" (AKA Luke Goodman) brought his love for NERF and expertise on blaster fun to his advantage with his team of athletes including Dontavious Hill, Hannah White, Lyric Swann, Maya Brady, Meechie Johnson and Mitchell Pehlke.The first official NERFBALL game comprised of four, 4-minute quarters, where the two powerhouse teams engaged in a heated competition in hopes of coming out on top. Athletes were each assigned a position – Defender, Midfielder and Runner – and used an official NERF PRO LEAGUE ball, NERF PRO STRYFE X blaster and NERF PRO darts to score points in two ways; shoot the NERFBALL through the net for six points or hit an opposing player with a dart for one point. In 2024, NERF will roll out hit detection gear with proprietary foam incorporating XO-Nano technology, giving players a way to detect dart hits in real-time.Story continues""In 2019, we set out as a team on a journey to invent the first official sport of NERF and along the way created some of the most break frame technology to enhance the playing experience.

The findings reflect the medical trend expectations of Aon professionals based on their interactions with clients and carriers represented in the portfolio of the firm's Health Solutions business throughout the world.  In Canada, the report forecasted the average medical trend rate for 2024 to be 5.0 percent, down from 7.5 percent in 2023.The trend rate figures represent the percentage increases in medical plan unit costs - insured and self-insured - that are anticipated to be required to address projected price inflation, technology advances in the medical field, plan utilization patterns and cost shifting from social programs.Lower net percentage in CanadaWhile Canadian medical trend is forecasted to be 2.6 percent higher than general inflation next year, it will be low compared with the rest of the world, at 10.1 percent. A gradual return to normal inflation levels, combined with the cost-control measures implemented by group benefit plan sponsors in recent years, provides a better forecast for healthcare trend in Canada for 2024 compared to 2023.""The continued addition of biosimilar specialty drugs has led to recent savings in costs,"" said Joey Raheb, senior vice president and Canadian national leader for growth and client engagement for Health Solutions at Aon. ""Employers have responded to the changing economic landscape by reviewing their spending.""According to Aon, it will be important to monitor the effects of the backlog in preventive and diagnostic treatments observed in recent years, which could result in a significant increase in health risks and the aggravation of minor issues not treated in a timely manner. These delays create a lag in the claims associated with treating those conditions for group benefit plans, an effect that will be somewhat minimized in 2024.Story continues""While the focus is on diversity, equity and inclusion, mental health and wellbeing initiatives remain paramount for organizations, though some cost pressure is expected to remain, which may mitigate any enhancements or introductions of new costs to programs,"" Raheb added. ""Overall, we expect the medical trend to be lower than the rates seen in previous years, and we are more optimistic about a sustainable healthcare outlook.""The top three medical conditions driving medical plan costs in Canada are:DiabetesMental HealthAutoimmune DiseasesGlobally, Aon has forecasted the average medical trend rate for 2024 to be 10.1 percent, up from 9.2 percent in 2023 and the highest since 2015. The top medical conditions driving medical plan costs globally are:CardiovascularCancer/Tumor GrowthHigh Blood Pressure/HypertensionAs employer-sponsored medical plans become a larger part of total rewards spend and pressure mounts to accurately forecast and manage costs, this report will serve as a valuable resource for organizations to plan global budgets and benefits strategies through better decisions that help build more resilient workforces for 2024 and beyond.""We have been in a period of remarkable inflationary conditions and economic volatility. The series of shocks affecting economies around the world after the COVID-19 pandemic continue to create an unstable environment for the healthcare market, despite continued signs of improvement. Volatile conditions will persist,"" said Rui Silva, vice president and medical trend leader in Health Solutions for Multinationals at Aon. ""Despite uncertainty on how long global inflationary pressures will last, it is clear from the locations surveyed that the medical trend rate will see a sharp rise in 2024 among employer-sponsored medical plans.""The report is based on insights from 113 Aon offices that broker, administer or advise on employer-sponsored medical plans in each of the countries covered in the report.

Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren't producing income? You can only cut your expenses so far, and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income.Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesA rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Axis Capital (AXS) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.44 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.08%. This compares to the Insurance - Property and Casualty industry's yield of 0.1% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 2.33%. Check Axis Capital (AXS) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Preferred Bank (PFBC) is paying out a dividend of $0.55 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.55% compared to the Banks - West industry's yield of 3.27% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 27.91% over the past year. Check Preferred Bank (PFBC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.87 per share, Prologis (PLD) has a dividend yield of 3.13%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.98% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 10.13%. Check Prologis (PLD) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: United Parcel Service UPS, FedEx FDX, Air Canada ACDVF and Covenant Logistics CVLG.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:UPS Gets Ready to Hire 100K+ Holiday WorkersUnited Parcel Service has announced plans to add more than 100,000 seasonal workers throughout the United States in a bid to meet the anticipated demand swell during the upcoming holiday season. Even though demand for online shopping has slowed down from the pandemic peak with the removal of COVID-19 restrictions, it remains strong.Moreover, additional workers are needed to ensure a repeat of UPS' buoyant performance witnessed last year with respect to timeliness. Therefore, the decision to hire additional workers to meet the anticipated annual increase in package volume, that will begin in October 2023 through January 2024, is a prudent one.UPS has made the process of hiring employees very easy and uncomplicated. The ease with which new personnel are enrolled is evident from short (less than 20 minutes) duration of the process (in most cases), wherein an applicant can fill out an online form and land a job. Moreover, nearly 80% of seasonal workers do not need to even appear for an interview. Openings are for full and part-time seasonal positions, and will primarily attract delivery drivers, Commercial Driver's License or CDL drivers and package handlers.In connection with new recruits, we expect UPS' rival FedEx to soon announce its plans for adding seasonal employees to its workforce. We note that UPS and FedEx hire multiple temporary workers each year to move more parcels in the October-January period.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUPS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while FDX is presently #3 Ranked (Hold).Story continuesInvestors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like Air Canada and Covenant Logistics.

However, it has recently witnessed a daily loss of 1.21%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of -7.08%. Fresh insights from the GF Score hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of NiSource Inc.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NI. Click here to check it out. NI 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NIIs NiSource Inc (NI) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthWhat Is the GF Score?The GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 4/10GF Value rank: 5/10Momentum rank: 5/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned NiSource Inc the GF Score of 69 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding NiSource Inc BusinessNiSource is one of the nation's largest natural gas distribution companies with approximately 3.2 million customers in Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. NiSource's electric utility transmits and distributes electricity in northern Indiana to about 500,000 customers. The regulated electric utility also owns more than 3,000 megawatts of generation capacity, most of which is now coal-fired but is being replaced by natural gas and renewable energy. With a market cap of $10.28 billion and sales of $5.85 billion, the company operates with a margin of 20.9%.Story continuesIs NiSource Inc (NI) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthFinancial Strength BreakdownNiSource Inc's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.97 positions it worse than 62.04% of 432 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.53, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 5.97, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 71.56% of 443 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where NiSource Inc seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -1.6 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 86.42% of 486 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, NiSource Inc predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Is NiSource Inc (NI) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthNext StepsGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While NiSource Inc has a rich history in the Utilities - Regulated industry, its current financial health and growth prospects suggest that it may struggle to maintain its historical performance. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

This project is located in West Shetland region, approximately 130 miles northwest of the Shetland Islands in the United Kingdom.Contract DetailsThe contract is valued between $500 million and $1 billion, and will contribute significantly to local value and job creation across the United Kingdom.

309,e4259806-ccaa-3cf1-bfd6-c3bba6cf170b,PPL,2023-09-29,Is PPL (PPL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value Trap,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppl-ppl-too-good-true-163428047.html,1695918868,STORY,"['VALU', 'PPL']","[Value-focused investors are constantly on the lookout for stocks that are currently undervalued. PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL) is one such stock that has caught the attention of many due to its current price of 23.46, which has recorded a loss of 2.03% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 9.65%. According to its GF Value, the fair valuation of the stock is $44.21.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with PPL. Click here to check it out. PPL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PPLThe GF Value is a unique method that calculates the current intrinsic value of a stock. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. This calculation is based on three key factors: historical multiples that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. The GF Value Line is considered the fair value at which the stock should be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is PPL (PPL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, before making an investment decision, investors must consider a more in-depth analysis. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL) should not be overlooked. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.9, and a Beneish M-Score of -1.73 that exceeds -1.78, the threshold for potential earnings manipulation. Additionally, the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years. This raises a crucial question: Is PPL a hidden gem or a value trap? These indicators suggest that PPL, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-Score and Beneish M-ScoreThe Altman Z-score is a financial model invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968. This model predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.On the other hand, the Beneish M-Score is based on eight financial variables that reflect different aspects of a company's financial performance and position. These variables include Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Gross Margin (GM), Total Long-term Assets Less Property, Plant and Equipment over Total Assets (TATA), change in Revenue (?REV), change in Depreciation and Amortization (?DA), change in Selling, General and Admin expenses (?SGA), change in Debt-to-Asset Ratio (?LVG), and Net Income Less Non-Operating Income and Cash Flow from Operations over Total Assets (?NOATA).Introduction to PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL)PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL) is a holding company of regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Rhode Island. The Pennsylvania regulated delivery and transmission segment distributes electricity to customers in central and eastern Pennsylvania. LG&amp;E and KU are involved in regulated electricity generation, transmission, and distribution in Kentucky. The Kentucky utilities also serve gas customers. Narragansett operates electric and gas utilities in Rhode Island.Is PPL (PPL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapPPL's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA closer look at PPL's Altman Z-score reveals that the company's financial health may be weak, suggesting a possibility of financial distress. The Gross Margin index, which tracks the evolution of a company's gross profit as a proportion of its revenue, shows a downward trend. This could indicate issues such as overproduction or more generous credit terms, both of which are potential red flags for earnings manipulation. By examining the past three years of PPL's historical data (2021: 49.49; 2022: 42.90; 2023: 36.11), we find that its Gross Margin has contracted by 5.97%. Such a contraction in the gross margin can negatively impact the company's profitability as it signifies lesser income from each dollar of sales. This could put a strain on the company's capacity to manage operating costs, potentially undermining its financial stability.Is PPL (PPL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of PPL, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 10.61; 2020: 5.88; 2021: 7.22; 2022: 8.66; 2023: 11.74; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-3.5%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for PPL's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is PPL (PPL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthThe company's earnings picture does not look much brighter. The 3-year EPS without NRI growth rate (-1.3%) is sluggish, and the future 3 to 5-year EPS growth estimate (11%) does not show a promising uptick. These indicators could suggest the company is struggling to translate sales into profits effectively, a critical element of a successful business model.Despite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, PPL's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In PPL's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations. Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.ConclusionAfter a thorough analysis, it is clear that PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL) might be a potential value trap. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, the company's declining revenues and earnings, coupled with a low Altman Z-score and a high Beneish M-Score, raise serious concerns about its financial health. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the Walter Schloss Screen .

The ongoing momentum in the Industrial and Flow Technologies, and Water Solutions segments has helped offset the impact of low volumes in the pool business on its results.Focus on product introductions, acquisitions and investments, which are in sync with its strategy to expand in the areas of pool, and residential and commercial water treatment, will continue to aid growth.Pentair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of the company have gained 58.1% in a year compared with the industry’s 9% growth. The Zacks Industrial Products sector has gained 19.4% and the S&amp;P 500 composite has risen 17.6% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTransformation Initiatives, Pricing to Aid 2023 ResultsPentair’s pool business has been witnessing low demand lately. The ongoing inventory correction has also been weighing on the pool segment’s results. Despite this, Pentair delivered 2.9% growth in overall sales in the first quarter of 2023, followed by 2% growth in the second quarter. It has also delivered margin expansion across all three segments.Results were aided by improved performances in the Industrial and Flow Technologies and Water Solutions segments, benefits from pricing, cost-cutting initiatives and progress on its Transformation initiatives.The company expects the channel inventory correction in the Pool business to be completed by the end of the third quarter. Gains from the transformation initiatives are also expected to accelerate. These factors, along with pricing actions and gains from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition, will help offset the impact of higher costs and low pool volumes on the company’s results.Pentair now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 for 2023. The company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.68 in 2022. Our model projects adjusted earnings per share to be $3.72 for 2023, suggesting 1% year-over-year growth.Story continuesUpward Revision in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PNR’s earnings for 2023 has moved up 1% over the past 30 days and is currently pegged at $3.71 per share. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has also seen a northward revision of 2% to $4.23 per share.Demand Prospects Look SolidEven though the pool business is currently bearing the brunt of weak demand and ongoing inventory correction, it is expected to eventually pick up. The company estimates that the pool industry in North America is catering to a large installed base of approximately 5.4 million pools, with the average age of these pools being 20-25 years.Around 60% of the industrial demand is for repairing, 20% for major remodeling and 20% for new pools, Pentair is well-poised to gain from these demand trends in the long term. Also, given that half of the installed pools lack any form of automation, the growing preference for more autonomous and energy-efficient pools will benefit the company as well.Strategic Initiatives to Aid GrowthPentair is focused on expanding digital transformation, innovation, technology and brand building. The company has a strong product pipeline. It is also expanding in the areas of pool and residential and commercial water treatment through acquisitions. To this end, Pentair completed the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice, a leading provider of commercial ice makers.Pentair has embarked on a Transformation program to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion. The program is structured in multiple phases and is expected to drive operational efficiency, streamline processes, reduce complexity while meeting financial objectives. The company is targeting to make its return on sales to be around 23% by 2025, through the program, from the 18.6% return on sales in 2022. It will also be using automation to increase productivity.Solid Balance Sheet Bodes WellOver the past five years, the company has generated a cumulative free cash flow of more than $2 billion. The company has a long-term target to consistently generate free cash flow, which is greater than the 100% conversion of its net income. Its total debt-to-total capital ratio stood at 0.42 at the end of second-quarter 2023. It has no significant long-term debt maturing in the next five years.

While most of the growth across categories and organic sales in recent quarters has been pricing-driven, the company remains confident about delivering sustained organic growth in the quarters ahead. KDP has been witnessing less elastic volume growth for the past few quarters. Also, demand trends, although strong, have been reflecting the impacts of pressures on consumers.Although the company expects pricing-led gains to moderate in the second half of 2023, it anticipates continued momentum in organic sales due to its efforts to create value across three key dimensions. These dimensions mainly comprise growth in core brands, enriching the portfolio and effective omnichannel, selling and distribution systems.The company’s focus on core brands revolves around marketing and brand renovation. Driven by its efforts, Dr Pepper was the largest share gainer in the CSD category in the second quarter due to the success of Strawberries &amp; Cream and the continued strong momentum of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar. The Keurig brand also outperformed, driven by its multicultural appeal.Keurig’s emphasis on enriching the portfolio relates to filling portfolio white spaces through innovation and external partnerships. Gains from recent innovations and effective in-market execution, along with the contribution from its sales and distribution partnership for C4 Energy, were well reflected in second-quarter results. We note that the C4 distribution transition is proceeding well. The company remains confident about the growth potential of C4.Keurig’s approach to enhancing the effectiveness of its omnichannel, selling and distribution systems is well on track. The success of its selling and distribution engine is evident from the 60% increase in the total points of distribution recorded in the second quarter across KDP-distributed geographies. Continued brand velocity and share gains for C4 underpin growth in distribution points witnessed in the second quarter.These three key dimensions position the company for sustained organic sales growth in the near term. Additionally, the resulting momentum has been well-reflected in its share price, with the stock outperforming the industry and the market. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 3% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 1.5%. The stock also compared favorably with the sector and the S&amp;P 500’s declines of 5.2% and 2.7%, respectively, in the same period.Further, optimism about the stock is reflected in its forward estimates, which suggest notable growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for KDP’s 2023 sales and earnings implies growth of 6% each from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUpbeat ViewFollowing second-quarter results, Keurig Dr Pepper raised its sales view for 2023. The company expects sales growth of 5-6%, which is higher than the 5% projected earlier. For adjusted earnings, KDP expects an increase of 6-7%.Other Key PicksWe have highlighted three other top-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Coca-Cola KO, Constellation Brands STZ and Mondelez International MDLZ.Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of CAS Investment Partners’ history, investment philosophy, and hedge fund performance, go directly to 5 Top Stocks CAS Investment Partners is Buying.Founded by Clifford Sosin, CAS Investment Partners has found its footing in the market after a roller-coaster 2022. Sosin launched the hedge fund in 2012 after working five years as a director in the Fundamental Investment Group of UBS.Sosin's investment strategy focuses on highly undervalued companies backed by solid underlying fundamentals. While conducting an in-depth analysis, the hedge fund manager tries to determine why a business will grow and tries to develop a hypothesis. The hedge fund manager prefers to hold stocks for a very long time to generate value.CAS Investment Partners is up by about 88% year to date, outperforming the broader market by a large margin. The hedge fund has benefited from the overall market turning bullish, with the S&amp;P 500 up by about 15% and the NASDAQ up by about 37%. Nevertheless, it has also benefited from solid stock picks and activist campaigns that have generated significant returns.The outperformance helped recoup most of the losses accrued in 2022 at the height of a bearish run that saw many stocks under pressure. The hedge fund, which focuses on long-term value investing and seeks to identify and exploit market inefficiencies, saw most of its investments turn sour at the height of the bearish run.Its investments in online used car retailer Carvana backfired, with the stock plunging by more than 70% as the once-pandemic darling fell out of favor. The company was facing cash burn issues and struggled to raise $3.3 billion in the corporate debt market.The underperformance in 2022 starkly contrasted its previous preface, as the hedge fund had not had a down year since launching in 2012. It delivered 65.79% gain in 2013, 6.31% in 2014, 14.47% in 2015, 22.03% in 2016, 31.24% in 2017, and 64.47% in 2018 until October 29. In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic sent shockwaves, the hedge fund returned a record 96.5%.Story continuesFast forward, the hedge fund has bounced back to winning ways, going by the 88% plus gain year to date. The gain has come on most hedge fund holdings rallying on the overall market turning bullish. The outperformance also stems from the fact that the hedge fund has most of its holdings in the consumer discretionary sector.CAS Investment Partners, Cliff SosinClifford Sosin of CAS Investment Partners The consumer discretionary sector has benefited from improved consumer spending as inflation levels edge lower.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Norfolk Southern is:20% = US$2.6b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit.Does Norfolk Southern Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Norfolk Southern has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Norfolk Southern's Debt And Its 20% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Norfolk Southern, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.24. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course Norfolk Southern may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.9bUS$11.9bUS$12.2bUS$13.0bUS$13.6bUS$14.1bUS$14.6bUS$15.0bUS$15.5bUS$15.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.59%Est @ 3.86%Est @ 3.34%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.56% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$10.2kUS$10.6kUS$10.2kUS$10.3kUS$10.1kUS$9.9kUS$9.6kUS$9.3kUS$9.0kUS$8.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$98bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$405bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$405b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$223bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$321b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$55.8, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Coca-ColaStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Beverage industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Coca-Cola, there are three pertinent aspects you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. At the start of the year, there was a lot of excitement surrounding tech stocks. However, as investor sentiment shifted, other types of investments gained attention. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell by 5.32% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date returns to 27.09%, as of September 28. During uncertain times, investors prefer dependable stocks to earn a steady income and maintain their financial stability.Dividend stocks are often considered relatively stable investments compared to some other types of stocks, particularly those that do not pay dividends. When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn their attention to companies that regularly grow their dividends. Steady and consistent dividend increases indicate that a company is financially strong. This can also assist investors in creating a portfolio that consistently generates high dividend income over time. In our article titled 14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now, we referred to Hartford Funds data and mentioned that companies that either raised or started paying dividends since 1973 have achieved the best returns compared to other stocks. These returns were achieved with less price fluctuations. During this time, dividend growers and initiators provided a 10.24% return, while companies that reduced dividends returned 3.95% to shareholders.Dividend stocks can provide income even when the broader stock market is experiencing declines, which can help investors ride out challenging market conditions. In addition to this, these equities, especially those from established companies, tend to have lower volatility compared to growth stocks, which can experience more significant price swings. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, during the 1970s, a period known for both high inflation and sluggish economic growth, dividends accounted for 70% of the overall returns investors earned. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade in which total returns were negative. Dividend returns of nearly 2% helped offset the negative price returns caused by events like the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis, providing a cushion for investors.Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowWhile dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, have not performed as well as the overall market this year, analysts are optimistic about the potential for these stocks to perform better in the remaining part of the year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”11.

While most of the growth across categories and organic sales in recent quarters has been pricing-driven, the company remains confident about delivering sustained organic growth in the quarters ahead. KDP has been witnessing less elastic volume growth for the past few quarters. Also, demand trends, although strong, have been reflecting the impacts of pressures on consumers.Although the company expects pricing-led gains to moderate in the second half of 2023, it anticipates continued momentum in organic sales due to its efforts to create value across three key dimensions. These dimensions mainly comprise growth in core brands, enriching the portfolio and effective omnichannel, selling and distribution systems.The company’s focus on core brands revolves around marketing and brand renovation. Driven by its efforts, Dr Pepper was the largest share gainer in the CSD category in the second quarter due to the success of Strawberries &amp; Cream and the continued strong momentum of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar. The Keurig brand also outperformed, driven by its multicultural appeal.Keurig’s emphasis on enriching the portfolio relates to filling portfolio white spaces through innovation and external partnerships. Gains from recent innovations and effective in-market execution, along with the contribution from its sales and distribution partnership for C4 Energy, were well reflected in second-quarter results. We note that the C4 distribution transition is proceeding well. The company remains confident about the growth potential of C4.Keurig’s approach to enhancing the effectiveness of its omnichannel, selling and distribution systems is well on track. The success of its selling and distribution engine is evident from the 60% increase in the total points of distribution recorded in the second quarter across KDP-distributed geographies. Continued brand velocity and share gains for C4 underpin growth in distribution points witnessed in the second quarter.These three key dimensions position the company for sustained organic sales growth in the near term. Additionally, the resulting momentum has been well-reflected in its share price, with the stock outperforming the industry and the market. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 3% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 1.5%. The stock also compared favorably with the sector and the S&amp;P 500’s declines of 5.2% and 2.7%, respectively, in the same period.Further, optimism about the stock is reflected in its forward estimates, which suggest notable growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for KDP’s 2023 sales and earnings implies growth of 6% each from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUpbeat ViewFollowing second-quarter results, Keurig Dr Pepper raised its sales view for 2023.

The latest catalyst for volatile trading is the tumbling U.S. consumer confidence. On Sep 26, the Conference Board reported that the index for Consumer Confidence in September came in at 103, missing the consensus estimate of 105.5.The metric for August was revised upward to 108.7 from 106.1 reported earlier. September marked the second consecutive month of the index’s decline and the largest monthly decline for the index since December 2020.The Present Situation Index— based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions— rose marginally to 147.1 in September from 146.7 in August. The Expectations Index— based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions— declined to 73.7 in September, after falling to 83.3 in August and 88 in July. Notably, any reading of the Expectations Index below 80, historically signals a recession within next year.According to Dana Peterson, the chief economist at The Conference Board, “Expectations for the next six months tumbled back below the recession threshold of 80, reflecting less confidence about future business conditions, job availability, and incomes.""Peterson also said, ""Consumers may be hearing more bad news about corporate earnings, while job openings are narrowing, and interest rates continue to rise — making big-ticket items more expensive.""In a similar kind of study, on Sep 15, the University of Michigan reported that the preliminary Index for U.S. Consumer Sentiment in September dropped to 67.7, missing the consensus estimate of 69.2. The final metric of the Index in August was 69.5.At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.

(NYSE:MHK) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Mohawk Industries Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$732.1mUS$630.7mUS$741.5mUS$800.3mUS$829.8mUS$856.6mUS$881.4mUS$905.0mUS$927.8mUS$950.2mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 3.69%Est @ 3.23%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.52%Est @ 2.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.7% US$667US$524US$562US$552US$522US$491US$461US$431US$403US$376(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.0bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$950m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.7%– 2.2%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 9.7%)10= US$5.1bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$10b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$83.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mohawk Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.512. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Table 1 reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:Share-based compensation expenseAmortization of acquired technologyAmortization of other acquired intangible assetsGoodwill and intangible asset impairment chargesGains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assetsProfessional fees and transaction costs for business combinationsWe also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:Gains and losses on debt and equity securities and other investmentsIncome tax effects and adjustmentsDiscontinued operationsWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit’s operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments, or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.Share-based compensation expenses. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire a business in a business combination, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the business and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired businesses. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete, and trade names.Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.Gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets because they are unrelated to our ongoing business operating results.Professional fees and transaction costs for business combinations. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal, and accounting fees.Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and gains and losses on other investments.Income tax effects and adjustments. We use a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating results and for planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate excludes the income tax effects of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our current long-term projections, we are using a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for fiscal 2024. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for various reasons including significant acquisitions, changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. We will evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis and whenever any significant events occur which may materially affect this rate.Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table 1 include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments, and disposals of business and long-lived assets.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230928913244/en/ContactsInvestors Kim WatkinsIntuit Inc.650-944-3324kim_watkins@intuit.comMedia Kali FryIntuit Inc.650-944-3036kali_fry@intuit.com]"

The effects of the pandemic have propelled the need for consumers and other entities to move to cashless payments and easy access to credit. This rising demand comes with the growing need to innovate and increase competition. This also pushed other big players into digital banking and payments and led to the rise of fintech stocks to buy.The presence of big players has pushed some companies aside and increased market volatility due to competition. However, these factors have also brought other fintech companies back to attractive levels. Combining this with underlying potential for growth and a strong portfolio of service offerings may be a chance for tech-savvy investors to grow their profits even more. Now, let’s look at three high-potential fintech stocks to buy right now.Intuit (INTU)cash and a pen lay atop a paper with graphs and tablesSource: ShutterstockIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is a financial technology platform that provides compliance, financial management, and marketing services to small businesses and consumers. Some of its popular offerings include QuickBooks, which provides payroll solutions, time-processing, and other management services. INTU also offers TurboTax, which helps consumers with their income tax preparations. The company has also recently introduced its new product, Intuit Assist, an AI-based financial assistant that targets both consumers and business and help with their financial decisions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsINTU finished its 2023 fiscal year (ending July 31, 2023) with superb results, with the latest EPS  exceeding guidance by 300%. Revenue for the quarter also grew by 12% YoY, while its full-year revenue was up 13% YoY. This makes it one of those fintech stocks to buy.With the release of its full-year financials, the company also expects to increase its 2024 revenue by 11-12%, GAAP diluted EPS by 11-15%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by 12-14%. Its continued growth, bright expectations, and expanding ecosystem with its Intuit Assist puts it in the spotlight as one of our picks for the fintech stocks to buy.Story continuesMarqeta (MQ)a pile of credit cardsSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.comMarqeta (NASDAQ:MQ) is a card issuer and payment solutions company that offers its products in different configurations. Its two main offerings give its clients access to independent processing tools that serve online marketplaces and digital banking under the “Powered by Marqueta” brand. Its other offering under the “Managed by Marqueta” service caters to banks and helps them with card programs, identification numbers, etc.MQ has been capitalizing on the trend toward embedded finance with its portfolio of products that serve different aspects of the legacy banking programs for debit, credit, risk, and money management. All in all, it’s one of those fintech stocks to buy.The company has recently acquired Power Finance, which will further boost the range of products its clients can launch. MQ also extended its partnership contract with Block, which the company expects to provide a good amount of growth for the next four years. No wonder analysts recommend Marqeta as a “Buy” rated stock.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThe last company on our list is one of the giants in the fintech space. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the earliest companies that introduced digital payments and helped revolutionize how consumers and businesses pay and receive payment goods and services. The company has a comprehensive portfolio of products catering to growing customer requirements like Venmo, Xoom, Paypal Zettle, and Paypal Honey. This continued growth has made PayPal and its products one of the top choices for consumers to use for their payments and financial transactions.While it has shrunk in size compared to before the pandemic, PYPL has shown resiliency and continued to show signs of slowly recovering its financial performance. PYPL’s second-quarter net revenue grew by 7%, and its GAAP operating income increased by 48%. In fact, investors should note that the company grew its GAAP EPS by 414% on a YoY basis. However, the company’s Q22023 EPS did miss analyst estimates by -7.78%, and the stock tanked. That said, we don’t see PayPal going anywhere, and the continued revenue growth coupled with consumers’ drive to adopt a digital wallet puts PYPL as one of the fintech stocks worth checking out.On the date of publication, Rick Orford held long positions in PYPL.

Currently home to a slew of top-rated stocks, DaVita DVA, Encompass Health EHC, and Option Care Health OPCH stand out with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Let’s see why now is a good time to buy these highly-ranked medical stocks as they look to build on stronger momentum over the last six months. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDaVita: As shown in the performance reference chart, DaVita’s stock has soared +22% over the last six months and is in a prime position to benefit from the stronger business environment in regards to the Medical-Outpatient and Home Healthcare space.Correlating with such, in the last 60 days fiscal 2023 and FY24 earnings estimates have risen 8% and 5% respectively. DaVita is now expecting sound growth on its top and bottom lines as a leading provider of dialysis services operating kidney dialysis centers with outpatient and inpatient offerings across the United States.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTotal sales are forecasted to be up 2% this year and rise another 2% in FY24 to $12.16 billion. Plus, annual earnings are now projected to jump 12% in FY23 and rise another 4% in FY24 at $7.72 per share with DaVita’s stock trading attractively at 13.2X forward earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEncompass Health: Offering facility-based patient care through its network of rehabilitation hospitals, Encompass Health’s stock has soared +27% over the last six months.Story continuesThe company’s bottom line expansion is very compelling with Encompass having a national footprint that includes 158 hospitals across 36 states and Puerto Rico. Annual earnings are anticipated to soar 21% in FY23 at $3.45 per share compared to EPS of $2.85 last year. Fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to climb another 8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMore importantly, FY23 EPS estimates are up 8% in the last two months with FY24 estimates rising 5%. Encompass stock also trades near the industry average of 19.1X forward earnings and slightly beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 20X. Furthermore, total sales are forecasted to dip -2% this year but rebound and jump 8% in FY24 to $5.16 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOption Care Health: Option Care Health’s stock is up a respectable +4% in the last six months with the company providing infusion and homecare management solutions.Option Care offers products, services, and condition-specific clinical management programs for gastrointestinal abnormalities, infectious diseases, cancer, and heart failure among other serious conditions.Fiscal 2023 EPS estimates have remained higher over the last quarter with earnings now expected at $1.42 per share skyrocketing 71% from $0.83 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to dip -13% to $1.23 a share after what would be a tougher to compete against year but EPS estimates are still up over the last 90 days as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven better, FY24 EPS projections would still represent substantial growth over the last five years considering Option Care has not had sustainable profitability until 2021 with earnings at an adjusted loss of -$0.04 a share in 2020.Investors aren’t paying a high premium for Option Care’s very expansive bottom-line growth with OPCH shares trading at 23.2X forward earnings and not at a stretched valuation to the industry. Option Care's sales are also expected to rise 8% in FY23 and climb another 9% in FY24 to $4.66 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe trend of rising earnings estimates is abundant among the top-rated Zacks Medical-Outpatient and Home Healthcare Industry which is a strong sign that these stocks could move higher in the near future. This is especially true as broader market volatility begins to fade with DaVita, Encompass Health, and Option Care Health offering essential services that make their stocks viable long-term investments as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ECL is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its focus on research and development (R&amp;D). The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance, along with its strong business, is expected to contribute further. Compliance risks and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 15% compared with a 16.5% rise of the industry and 17.7% growth of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services provider has a market capitalization of $47.85 billion. It projects 12.8% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain a strong performance. Ecolab’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Focus on R&amp;D: Ecolab’s R&amp;D program consists principally of developing and validating the performance of new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of those already existing, improving service program content, evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support. Management believes continued R&amp;D activities are critical to maintaining its leadership position within the industry and will provide it with a competitive advantage as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers.Strong Business: Ecolab’s consistent delivery of considerable earnings growth despite the current challenging business environment continues to impress. Ecolab witnessed a strong second-quarter 2023 performance, which reflected continued robust organic sales growth, operating income margin expansion and growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Per management, pricing in the quarter remained strong, sustained by carryover from last year and further new pricing.Management also stated that its focus on new business and penetration generated share gains and value pricing and productivity drove strong margin recovery during the quarter.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Ecolab’s solid second-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company registered a robust year-over-year uptick in its top and bottom lines, along with solid performances across all segments. Strong pricing momentum and steady overall volume were also recorded. The company’s digital capabilities, innovation and global service expertise are expected to lead to robust new business wins, which are encouraging.DownsidesCompliance Risks: Ecolab’s business is subjected to various laws and regulations relating to the environment, including evolving climate change standards and the conduct of its business. Compliance with these laws and regulations exposes the company to potential financial liability and increases operating costs.Data Security Threat: Ecolab relies, to a large extent, upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate its business. The size and complexity of the company’s information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to failure, malicious intrusion and random attacks. Acquisitions have resulted in further de-centralization of systems and additional complexity in its systems infrastructure.Estimate TrendEcolab is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 2% north to $5.09.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.98 billion, suggesting an 8.4% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

Within Cardiovascular, Medtronic is gaining market share, banking on product launches. However, forex woes and stiff rivalry do not bode well for MDT.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decline 1.1% compared with the industry’s 8.4% fall and a 6.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $104.07 billion. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 3.37%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsMarket Share Gain Within Cardiovascular to Continue: Medtronic is expanding its global foothold within the Cardiovascular business (contributing more than 37% to total revenues in fiscal 2023). Within Cardiovascular, cardiac rhythm management, one of Medtronic’s largest businesses, continued to build on the company’s category leadership. Medtronic’s pacing business continued outperforming the market within cardiac rhythm management, banking on strong global growth of its Micra leadless pacemaker family as it enters new geographies and expands penetration in existing markets.Decent Sales Projections Within MedSurg: Within Medtronic’s Medical Surgical Portfolios, the company is gaining from the positive sales momentum with the rollout of its differentiated Hugo robotic system in many international markets. The company is also progressing well to bring Hugo to the United States. We are also impressed by Medtronic’s strong performance within Advanced Energy and Barrx, primarily driven by improved supply and continued growth in GI Genius and PillCam. Given less than 5% of surgical procedures globally are done robotically, Medtronic expects its surgical robotics business to become a meaningful growth driver soon.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesInternational Expansion Robust: in fiscal 2023, Medtronic generated nearly 48% of its revenues from the rest of the world. The company focuses on expanding in emerging markets to address the massively unmet and untapped demand for advanced medical technologies. In the fiscal first quarter, non-U.S. developed markets and Western Europe grew in the high single digits. Western Europe grew 8% again this quarter, with high-single-digit growth in Cardiovascular and Medical Surgical and high teen growth in Diabetes. Emerging markets grew 8% despite the adverse impact of new sanctions in Russia and the ongoing volume-based procurement (VBP) effect in China.DownsidesExposure to Currency Movement: With Medtronic recording a significant portion of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a significant dampener over the last few quarters, as with other important MedTech players. Medtronic expects its second-quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings would be negatively impacted by approximately 6% from adverse currency translation.Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. Medtronic earns most revenues from CRDM, Spinal and Cardio Vascular segments. The company faces intense competition in the CRDM segment from players such as Boston Scientific Corporation. Players such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Stryker Corporation, Zimmer and NuVasive have intensified competition, particularly in the Spinal segment.Estimate TrendsMedtronic has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings per share (EPS) has moved from $5.12 to $5.04 in the past 90 days.The consensus estimate for the company’s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $32.13 billion.

Don't Ignore These 2 Basic Materials Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130006372.html,1695906006,STORY,['LYB'],"[Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. LyondellBasell (LYB) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.98 a share 29 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 27, 2023.LYB has an Earnings ESP figure of 7.59%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.98 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84.LYB is just one of a large group of Basic Materials stocks with a positive ESP figure. Albemarle (ALB) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on November 1, 2023, Albemarle holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $5.48 a share 34 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Albemarle is $4.14, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 32.18%.LYB and ALB's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Lawyers for GE and Bornstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In January 2021, Furman dismissed separate fraud claims based on GE's alleged misrepresentations about its long-term care insurance portfolio, and dismissed former Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt as a defendant.Story continuesThe prior month, GE paid $200 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it misled investors about its insurance and power businesses.GE spun off its healthcare business in January and is expected to spin off its renewable energy and power business in 2024.

With a daily gain of 2.81% and a 3-month gain of 28.32%, Valero Energy has an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 29.03. However, the question remains: is the stock modestly overvalued? To answer this, we delve into a detailed valuation analysis. Let's unpack the financials and intrinsic value of Valero Energy.Company SnapshotWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with PPL. Click here to check it out. VLO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VLOValero Energy operates 15 refineries with a total throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels a day across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company also owns 12 ethanol plants with a capacity of 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol per year and holds a 50% stake in Diamond Green Diesel, which can produce 1.2 billion gallons per year of renewable diesel. With a stock price of $148 per share, the company has a market cap of $52.30 billion. However, its GF Value, an estimation of fair value, stands at $133.04, suggesting that the stock may be modestly overvalued.Unveiling Valero Energy (VLO)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that estimates the intrinsic value of a stock. It is derived from historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page offers an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade. When the stock price significantly surpasses the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if the stock price falls significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Based on the GuruFocus Value calculation, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) stock is believed to be modestly overvalued. At its current price of $148 per share, Valero Energy has a market cap of $52.30 billion. Therefore, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Valero Energy (VLO)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus, it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. Valero Energy has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.45, which is worse than 51.84% of 1034 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Valero Energy at 8 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Valero Energy is strong.Unveiling Valero Energy (VLO)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Valero Energy has been profitable 9 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $157.10 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $29.03. Its operating margin is 9.48%, which ranks better than 52.03% of 984 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Valero Energy at 8 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Valero Energy's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 69.37% of 862 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Valero Energy's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 45.7%, which ranks better than 81.08% of 830 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, Valero Energy's return on invested capital is 28.86, and its cost of capital is 10.15.Unveiling Valero Energy (VLO)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn summary, the stock of Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is believed to be modestly overvalued. The company's financial condition is strong and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 81.08% of 830 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At UnitedHealth GroupThe CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director, Andrew Witty, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.0m worth of shares at a price of US$487 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$504). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 6.6% of Andrew Witty's holding.UnitedHealth Group insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At UnitedHealth Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at UnitedHealth Group. In total, CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director Andrew Witty sold US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that UnitedHealth Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$1.5b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The UnitedHealth Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought UnitedHealth Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that UnitedHealth Group is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - UnitedHealth Group has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.But note: UnitedHealth Group may not be the best stock to buy.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Auto Components and Parts Stocks to Buy Now.The US auto industry is currently in the spotlight amid a massive United Auto Workers’ strike against three major companies, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.  Analysts are now certain that these strikes will have direct effects on financial results of these companies in the coming months. Wall Street Journal recently reported that Wells Fargo analysts believe that the three companies’ proposals to increase auto workers’ salaries would “add an estimated $700 million to $1.2 billion in costs to each company over the four-year life of the contract.” Estimates suggest that these costs will reach $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion under the union’s demand of 30% increase in wages, plus cost-of-living adjustments.However, the WSJ report quoted Richard Hilgert, a senior equity analyst for the automotive sector at Morningstar’s research arm, who said that despite the strikes the auto companies are still in a position to escape massive losses given these strikes don’t prolong.Analysts are also hinting that these strikes could expand to other parts of the industry, including the electric vehicle companies. Many auto components and parts companies that are directly or indirectly linked with traditional car companies and EV companies are anxiously waiting for these strikes to end. And they also have other plans in case the strikes do not end soon. The Wall Street Journal report quoted Ricardo Rodriguez, chief financial officer at Aspen Aerogels. Aspen Aerogels makes battery safety products for electric cars. Rodriguez said that if strikes in the auto industry expand to the EV sector or do not end soon, his company is ready to shift its focus to energy industrial products. The executive said his company could make the shift “within an hour.” Other companies are not that fortunate, though. Companies that supply parts and technologies to major car companies like Ford and General Motors are heavily reliant on the normal business cycle and these current disruptions could take a toll on their business. For example, according to the WSJ report,  Sensata Technologies, which makes sensors for cars, could see huge impact from the current strikes as Ford, GM and Stellantis account for a major chunk of the company’s revenue. The report, citing the company’s Vice President of Finance Jacob Sayer, said that about 9% of Sensata’s global revenue could be impacted if all plants for the three carmakers are offline.Story continuesFor this article we first used a stock screener to list down all publicly traded companies that make and sell auto parts and components.

And I think when they look at us they see an opportunity for improved margins – margin expansion, if you will, and a better balance sheet on reducing leverage. And I would tell you we agree for obvious reasons. So that’s where we stand. So as we, as we think about that special committee was in addition to adding some new very qualified directors, we put our special committee together to start looking at these things.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Estée Lauder Companies, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$23b - US$6.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Estée Lauder Companies has an ROCE of 10%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty standard return but compared to the Personal Products industry average it falls behind. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured Estée Lauder Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Estée Lauder Companies, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 24% over the last five years. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, we're somewhat concerned by Estée Lauder Companies' diminishing returns on increasing amounts of capital. Investors must expect better things on the horizon though because the stock has risen 8.5% in the last five years. Regardless, we don't like the trends as they are and if they persist, we think you might find better investments elsewhere.Estée Lauder Companies does come with some risks though, we found 4 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those are potentially serious...While Estée Lauder Companies may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Lauder in 1992 with the launch of the iconic Pink Ribbon. At a time when breast cancer wasn’t spoken about openly, Evelyn and ELC saw an opportunity to bring awareness to the disease and address stigmas in women’s health – inspiring a global movement around The Campaign’s mission to help create a breast cancer-free world for all.Together, The Estée Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer Campaign and The Estée Lauder Companies Charitable Foundation (ELCCF) have funded more than $118 million globally for life saving research, education, and medical services, with more than $93 million funding medical research through the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). BCRF, also founded by Evelyn Lauder in 1993, is The Campaign’s leading non-profit partner, dedicated to advancing the world’s most promising research to eradicate breast cancer.In honor of The Campaign’s 30th Anniversary in 2022, ELCCF made a commitment to donate $15 million over five years to BCRF to fund groundbreaking research that will further the goal of reducing breast cancer disparities and improving outcomes. This comprehensive study of the intersection of social determinants of health, comorbidities and the biology of breast cancer in Black women has the potential to significantly impact breast cancer disparities globally. A diverse steering committee, as well as sub-committees, comprised of BCRF experts in disparities from acclaimed academic and medical institutions from across the country have established initial targets critical to identifying the roots of health equity and disparities in breast cancer outcomes.

The latest catalyst for volatile trading is the tumbling U.S. consumer confidence. On Sep 26, the Conference Board reported that the index for Consumer Confidence in September came in at 103, missing the consensus estimate of 105.5.The metric for August was revised upward to 108.7 from 106.1 reported earlier. September marked the second consecutive month of the index’s decline and the largest monthly decline for the index since December 2020.The Present Situation Index— based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions— rose marginally to 147.1 in September from 146.7 in August. The Expectations Index— based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions— declined to 73.7 in September, after falling to 83.3 in August and 88 in July. Notably, any reading of the Expectations Index below 80, historically signals a recession within next year.According to Dana Peterson, the chief economist at The Conference Board, “Expectations for the next six months tumbled back below the recession threshold of 80, reflecting less confidence about future business conditions, job availability, and incomes.""Peterson also said, ""Consumers may be hearing more bad news about corporate earnings, while job openings are narrowing, and interest rates continue to rise — making big-ticket items more expensive.""In a similar kind of study, on Sep 15, the University of Michigan reported that the preliminary Index for U.S. Consumer Sentiment in September dropped to 67.7, missing the consensus estimate of 69.2.

In fiscal 2023, the company achieved a 7% increase in organic sales. This remarkable feat marked the second consecutive year of organic sales growth and the fifth consecutive year of at least 5% organic growth since fiscal 2019. Such consistency in organic sales growth is noteworthy, especially in economic volatility during 2020 and 2022.Diversified Product Portfolio: A Key to ResilienceProcter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) resilience during economic downturns is primarily attributed to its diversified product portfolio. The company operates across ten product categories, each catering to essential consumer needs. These categories encompass personal healthcare, feminine care, fabric care, home care, hair care, skin and personal care, baby care, family care, grooming, and oral care.It ensures that Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) remains relevant to consumers even when economic conditions force shifts in consumer spending. During recessions, consumers may cut back on discretionary spending, but they continue to purchase essential items like personal care products, diapers, and household cleaning supplies, all of which are part of Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) product portfolio.Global Resilience: Riding the E-Commerce Wave Amid Economic HeadwindsFurther, Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) global footprint is a plinth of its recession-proof nature. It allows the company to diversify its revenue streams and mitigate risks associated with regional economic downturns.Story continuesFor instance, in fiscal 2023, while China faced economic headwinds resulting in low single-digit organic sales growth, the company achieved strong results in its largest and most profitable market, the US. Organic sales in the US grew by 6%, building on a solid 8% growth in fiscal 2022.Fundamentally, the rise of e-commerce has transformed consumer behavior, and Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) has been quick to adapt to this trend. In this context, during fiscal 2023, the company reported that e-commerce sales increased by 7%, now representing 17% of its total sales.During economic recessions, consumers often seek ways to save money, and online shopping offers convenience and potential cost savings.

Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG), however, has demonstrated its ability to manage costs effectively.

For instance, in fiscal 2023, the company increased its dividend by 3%, leading to dividend growth back to back for 67 years, and returned over $16 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Lastly, Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) guidance for fiscal 2024 reinforces its status as a recession-resistant company. The company expects organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5%, EPS growth between 6% and 9%, and plans to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to shareholders. These projections indicate that Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) may continue to weather inflationary and recessionary pressures.P&amp;G's Recession-Proof MasteryUnwavering Strength: P&amp;G's Reliability, Scale, and Growth PromiseIn a market dominated by giants, Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) consistently emerges as a beacon of stability and promise supported by the following:Reliability: Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) steady performance is hard to overlook. Even during a rare dip in the top-line growth last year, the company managed a 5% hike in organic sales. As data suggests, the marginal decline was due to foreign currency exchange rates.Size Matters: In the consumer goods realm, size and scale directly affect profitability. Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) mammoth size allows it to maintain lower per-unit production costs and negotiate favorable prices with retailers. Its gigantic marketing budget is unparalleled, outstripping competitors like Unilever and Clorox.Growth Potential: With a consensus target price hovering around $168, Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) stock is ripe with a potential upside of 10%. Moreover, with most analysts rating the stock as a 'buy', there's significant room for growth in the coming months.Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) Dividend Yield: A Closer LookAt 2.57%, Procter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) dividend yield remains fairly attractive, particularly when considering the company's vast portfolio of iconic brands, from Crest to Pampers. This stable dividend yield and its unparalleled brand strength make Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) an enticing prospect for conservative income investors.P&amp;G's Recession-Proof MasteryConcluding ThoughtsProcter &amp; Gamble Co's (NYSE:PG) success isn't accidental.

SLG, together with its joint venture partners, recently announced the completion of the One Madison Avenue project three months ahead of schedule. This achievement not only underscores SL Green's commitment to excellence but also positions the company favorably in the evolving landscape of office space demand.SLG noted that One Madison Avenue, a 27-story, 1.4 million-square-foot premier office tower located in Manhattan's Midtown South submarket, has secured its Temporary Certificate of Occupancy on Sep 15, 2023. Additionally, SL Green received $577.4 million in cash, signifying the final equity payment from its joint venture partners, and these funds were subsequently employed to repay corporate unsecured debt.Situated adjacent to Madison Square Park, One Madison Avenue offers a groundbreaking workplace experience. The tower features innovative amenities and fosters a state-of-the-art, health-conscious workspace, including the DOAS HVAC system that circulates 100% fresh outside air.Furthermore, the project is expected to achieve LEED-Gold and WELL certifications, underscoring its commitment to sustainability and employee well-being. To further elevate the experience, the tower will house a stylish and refined steakhouse by Michelin-starred Chef Daniel Boulud.One Madison Avenue has already attracted the attention of leading technology and financial service firms, cementing its reputation as a premier office space in the heart of the city. Notable tenants include Chelsea Piers Fitness, International Business Machines Corporation IBM and Franklin Templeton, all of which have committed to long-term leases. This diverse range of tenants underscores the appeal of One Madison Avenue to a broad spectrum of industries.As the office space landscape evolves, SL Green is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging trends. The need for de-densification and high-quality, well-amenitized office properties is on the rise. SL Green's portfolio of well-located properties, combined with its ability to offer top-notch amenities in recently developed office buildings, makes it a standout player in this evolving market.Despite the negative effects of pandemic-borne job losses and the remote-working dynamics that have been hindering the U.S. office real estate sector, SL Green signed 84 office leases for its Manhattan office portfolio spanning around 915,431 square feet during the first half of 2023. This success is a testament to SLG's commitment to providing high-quality office spaces and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Furthermore, with a robust office leasing pipeline, SL Green is well-prepared to meet the demands of a changing world and continue its legacy as a leading force in New York City's real estate landscape.However, given the macroeconomic uncertainty, the demand for office properties is likely to remain subdued in the near term, raising concerns. Elevated supply and a high-interest-rate environment add to its woes. We project a notable year-over-year increase in net interest expenses in the current year.Shares of the company have rallied 22.6% in the past three months against the industry’s 8.8% fall.

360,b7343dda-90c1-3bbf-b4af-f3349160ab9e,ETN,2023-09-29,3 Manufacturing Electronics Stocks to Gain From Improving Supply Chains,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-manufacturing-electronics-stocks-gain-141900364.html,1695910740,STORY,"['AOS', '^GSPC', 'ENS', 'ETN']","[While weakness in the manufacturing sector is dampening demand in the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, recent signs of an uptick in manufacturing activities hold promise. Improving supply chains, deceleration in inflation, focus on digitalization and inorganic activities are expected to foster growth of the industry. Resiliency in some prominent end markets bodes well for these companies.Amid buoyant near-term prospects, companies like Eaton Corporation plc ETN, A. O. Smith Corporation AOS and EnerSys ENS are poised for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing-Electronics industry comprises companies that manufacture electronic products like battery chargers, battery accessories, outdoor cabinet enclosures, power transmission products, electrical motion controls and motive power devices. Some industry players also provide water-treatment products, engineered flow components, process equipment and turn-key systems. These companies also offer state-of-the-art customer support and after-market services to end users. These companies are increasing investments in developing innovative technologies, boosting customer and employee experience, as well as supply-chain modernization programs. The manufacturing electronic companies sell products and services in various end markets, including robotics, semiconductor, defense, aerospace, medical equipment and satellite communications.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Electronics IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector has been weighing on demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in August, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) touched 47.6%, contracting for the 10th consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index remained in the contraction territory at 46.8%, declining 0.5 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. While the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, it is showing signs of gradual improvement. The Manufacturing PMI has been steadily improving over the past few months. In August, the index increased 1.2 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. The uptick in manufacturing activities augurs well for the manufacturing electronics industry.End-Market Strength: Despite a slowdown in manufacturing activities, demand across key end markets remains stable. Well-diversified end markets, such as gas, mining, refining, energy, renewable, life sciences, metals, electrification and automation, should help industry players offset weakness in demand associated with a single market. Additionally, the digitalization of business operations is helping industry participants boost their competitiveness through enhanced operational productivity, product quality and better cost management. Inorganic growth strategies bode well for the industry’s prospects.Easing Supply-Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report’s Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the 11th straight month in August. Easing supply-chain issues should support manufacturing electronics companies’ growth in 2023. Additionally, a reduction in raw material costs, thanks to the deceleration in inflation, should aid the bottom line of manufacturing electronics companies.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing – Electronics industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #83. This rank places it in the top 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are keeping more faith in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have increased by 2.4% since the end of March.Given the upbeat near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks for your consideration. But it is worth looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and its current valuation first.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Manufacturing – Electronics industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index and the broader sector in the past year.Over this period, the industry has rallied 28.3% compared with the sector and S&amp;P 500 Index’s increase of 19.5% and 17.6%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 21.36X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.30X.

370,aebe60a2-efa5-3630-a554-57afbe66d173,AWK,2023-09-29,Consumer Confidence Plummets on Recession Fears: 5 Stocks to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-confidence-plummets-recession-fears-121700740.html,1695903420,STORY,"['AWK', 'KMB', 'CWCO', 'ALE', 'CL']","[Inflation has declined sharply over the past year but remains stubbornly high, which has raised concerns of an impending recession. This saw the consumer confidence of Americans ebbing further in September.The decline in consumer confidence in September was largely triggered by the Fed’s hawkish stance as it hinted at another interest rate hike this year. Markets have since been volatile and are expected to remain so for an extended period.Given this situation, investing in defensive stocks like ALLETE, Inc. ALE, Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO, American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK, Kimberly-Clark Corporation KMB and Colgate-Palmolive Company CL should be safe.Consumer Confidence DeclinesThe Conference Board said on Sep 26 that the Consumer Confidence Index declined to 103 in September from an upwardly revised 108.7 in August, to hit a four-month low as higher prices and inflationary pressures raised fears of a recession. Analysts had expected the index to come up with a reading of 105.5.The decline in confidence of Americans also reflects growing worries about higher interest rates and the current political environment. The United States faces the threat of a government shutdown on Saturday. This saw the confidence of consumers across all age groups taking a hit in September.Moreover, a sharp decline in how consumers perceive future business scenarios clearly signals their feeling of helplessness regarding an upcoming economic downturn.In September, the Expectations Index, the assessment of the short-term economic situation, income and labor market conditions, fell to 73.7 after declining to 83.3 in August.A reading below 80 is a level that historically signals an upcoming recession within a year.Although inflation has more than halved over the past year, it still is more than double the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The Fed thus maintained its hawkish stance and signaled at another interest rate hike this year.Story continuesThe central bank has increased interest rates on 11 occasions by 525 basis points since March 2022, barring in June and September. Another quarter percentage point would take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, a lot higher than the earlier forecast of 5.1%.Also, the Fed lowered its forecast for rate hike cuts to two from four next year. This is likely to further dent consumer confidence as higher interest rates for a longer period do not bode well for the economy.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors such as consumer staples, and utilities. Also, these stocks belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1).

The latest catalyst for volatile trading is the tumbling U.S. consumer confidence. On Sep 26, the Conference Board reported that the index for Consumer Confidence in September came in at 103, missing the consensus estimate of 105.5.The metric for August was revised upward to 108.7 from 106.1 reported earlier. September marked the second consecutive month of the index’s decline and the largest monthly decline for the index since December 2020.The Present Situation Index— based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions— rose marginally to 147.1 in September from 146.7 in August. The Expectations Index— based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions— declined to 73.7 in September, after falling to 83.3 in August and 88 in July. Notably, any reading of the Expectations Index below 80, historically signals a recession within next year.According to Dana Peterson, the chief economist at The Conference Board, “Expectations for the next six months tumbled back below the recession threshold of 80, reflecting less confidence about future business conditions, job availability, and incomes.""Peterson also said, ""Consumers may be hearing more bad news about corporate earnings, while job openings are narrowing, and interest rates continue to rise — making big-ticket items more expensive.""In a similar kind of study, on Sep 15, the University of Michigan reported that the preliminary Index for U.S. Consumer Sentiment in September dropped to 67.7, missing the consensus estimate of 69.2. The final metric of the Index in August was 69.5.At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option. If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) stocks with a solid dividend yield.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. At the start of the year, there was a lot of excitement surrounding tech stocks. However, as investor sentiment shifted, other types of investments gained attention. The tech-heavy NASDAQ fell by 5.32% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date returns to 27.09%, as of September 28. During uncertain times, investors prefer dependable stocks to earn a steady income and maintain their financial stability.Dividend stocks are often considered relatively stable investments compared to some other types of stocks, particularly those that do not pay dividends. When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn their attention to companies that regularly grow their dividends. Steady and consistent dividend increases indicate that a company is financially strong. This can also assist investors in creating a portfolio that consistently generates high dividend income over time. In our article titled 14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now, we referred to Hartford Funds data and mentioned that companies that either raised or started paying dividends since 1973 have achieved the best returns compared to other stocks. These returns were achieved with less price fluctuations. During this time, dividend growers and initiators provided a 10.24% return, while companies that reduced dividends returned 3.95% to shareholders.Dividend stocks can provide income even when the broader stock market is experiencing declines, which can help investors ride out challenging market conditions. In addition to this, these equities, especially those from established companies, tend to have lower volatility compared to growth stocks, which can experience more significant price swings. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, during the 1970s, a period known for both high inflation and sluggish economic growth, dividends accounted for 70% of the overall returns investors earned. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade in which total returns were negative. Dividend returns of nearly 2% helped offset the negative price returns caused by events like the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis, providing a cushion for investors.Story continuesAlso Read: 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowWhile dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, have not performed as well as the overall market this year, analysts are optimistic about the potential for these stocks to perform better in the remaining part of the year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.”11.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.59% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.35%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.83%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the seller of routers, switches, software and services had lost 6.35% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.71% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.84% in that time.Cisco Systems will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Cisco Systems to post earnings of $1.03 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 19.77%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.61 billion, up 7.18% from the prior-year quarter.CSCO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.05 per share and revenue of $57.74 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +4.11% and +1.3%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Cisco Systems. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends.

Cisco Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Cisco Systems is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 13.14.

(CSCO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-csco-trending-130011974.html,1695906011,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned -6.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has lost 4.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cisco is expected to post earnings of $1.03 per share, indicating a change of +19.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.05 points to a change of +4.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.22 indicates a change of +4.2% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $14.61 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.2%. The $57.74 billion and $58.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.3% and +2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $15.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $0.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.04%. The EPS surprise was +7.55%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
