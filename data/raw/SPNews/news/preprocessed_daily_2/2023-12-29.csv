SWRSX has no Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, but we have been able to look into other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.', 'History of Fund/Manager', ""Schwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWRSX. Schwab Treasury Inflation Protected Security debuted in March of 2006. Since then, SWRSX has accumulated assets of about $2.59 billion, according to the most recently available information. Matthew Hastings is the fund's current manager and has held that role since March of 2006."", 'Performance', 'Of course, investors look for strong performance in funds. SWRSX has a 5-year annualized total return of 2.64% and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of -1.56%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SWRSX's standard deviation comes in at 7.06%, compared to the category average of 7.38%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 6.17% compared to the category average of 6.65%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'SWRSX carries a beta of 0.65, meaning that the fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. With this in mind, it has a positive alpha of 1.8, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.', 'Expenses', 'For investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWRSX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.05% compared to the category average of 0.52%. So, SWRSX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.', 'This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'This could just be the start of your research on SWRSXin the Mutual Fund Bond category.

Brooke, so thanks so much for joining us this morning. Let's talk about this catch up trade. What's the expectation when you think about the rest of the S&P 500 for 2024."", 'BROOKE MAY: Yeah, we are very optimistic going into 2024. We think that the S&P could hit 5,200 to 5,400, and that would be about 11% earnings growth from here. Right now, the S&P looks expensive at about 21 times earnings.

Obviously, Magnificent Seven have been taking all the headlines, but that has left a lot of the S&P 500 out of the conversation. Where do you see the upside?', ""BROOKE MAY: Yeah. Right now we still like the big tech names. We think that there's good earnings growth there. So we don't feel like you need to completely rotate out of those positions. However, there are some really good deals out there and values."", ""One of the names we like, for example, is Charles Schwab. Unlike a lot of other companies that are hitting new highs, Schwab is down 17% year to date. They just completed the merger with TD Ameritrade, so there's going to be some cost synergies there."", ""In addition to that, the fact that we've had an inverted yield curve has really hurt their earnings because interest is a big part of what contributes to their profitability. So as we see the yield curve return to a traditional slope, that will be a little bit of a tailwind for Schwab as well.""]"

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement.

So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.43."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To begin with, Texas Instruments has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 15% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by Texas Instruments over the past five years."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Texas Instruments' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 30% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is TXN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""The high three-year median payout ratio of 53% (or a retention ratio of 47%) for Texas Instruments suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders."", ""Moreover, Texas Instruments is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 65% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio."", ""Overall, we feel that Texas Instruments certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely due to the company reinvesting its earnings at a pretty high rate of return. However, given the high ROE, we do think that the company is reinvesting a small portion of its profits. This could likely be preventing the company from growing to its full extent.

Most would be very happy with that. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 14% gain in the last three months. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 12% in 90 days).', ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Nucor ', ""In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During five years of share price growth, Nucor achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 25% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 28% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.', ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", ""It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Nucor, it has a TSR of 289% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""It's nice to see that Nucor shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 35% over the last year.

Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

He serves with the South Dakota Air National Guard 114th Fighter Wing as an active-duty National Guardsman. He also welcomes veterans home after Honor Flights to Washington, D.C. Alongside his colleagues at U.S. Bank, he strives to help active-duty military members transition into civilian life as business owners.', 'The more than 18 million veterans in the U.S. can serve as a powerful economic force as consumers, employees and employers. In fact, veteran-owned businesses make up about 5% of all businesses in the United States, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau published in 2023, covering industries from manufacturing to beauty and healthcare.', 'At the recent bank-sponsored event, dozens of veteran business owners came together to share challenges, find solutions and hear from Eimers and his U.S. Bank colleagues about starting and growing a business.', '""We want our veteran business owners to find success, and being able to provide financial tips and business development strategies alongside my small business banking colleagues is central to that,"" said Eimers, who sat on a panel during the first Brewing Financial Connections event in 2023. ""Knowledge can be a key difference maker in whether a business can successfully grow and thrive.""', ""While the bank's partnership with the VBOC of the Dakotas is new, the outreach center - which is part of the U.S. Small Business Administration - has been helping veterans for years.

""U.S. Bank\'s commitment to supporting veteran-owned entrepreneurs aligns perfectly with our mission. It has been instrumental in helping us organize this event, which allowed us to reach a broader audience and offer valuable resources to veteran and military spouse business owners throughout the Dakotas.""', 'Recalling the first conversation he had with Hinker, Jesse Mamaril - the U.S. Bank community affairs manager for North and South Dakota - said an introduction call quickly turned into a brainstorming session on how to better serve veteran business owners. For both VBOC of the Dakotas and U.S. Bank, that centered around knowledge.', '""There is wealth in knowledge,"" Mamaril said. ""Bringing together small businesses, nonprofits and other community leaders to share their expertise only builds a more sustainable community. Success in small business means a more vibrant local economy.""', ""It's a sentiment echoed by Hinker."", '""Supporting veteran-owned businesses is a way of giving back to those who\'ve served our country,"" Hinker said. ""By choosing to buy from or collaborate with veteran-owned businesses, the community helps boost our economy and create more job opportunities for veterans. It\'s a win-win situation that fosters a stronger sense of community and support.""', 'That resonates with Eimers, who spends his days supporting aspiring and current veteran business owners in healthcare at U.S. Bank while actively serving in the National Guard', '""Helping a business owner start out, find their footing and grow is not something any one person or group can do,"" Eimers said.

""That obviously has not proven to be the case.""', '""But the very reason that we started this company and the very reason that consumers are reaching for a product strengthens every single day, whether it\'s the health angle, whether it\'s climate, whether it\'s the energy and water use or animal welfare,"" Brown continued. ""All of those issues are intensifying, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.""', ""Today, Beyond Meat stock trades at $8.95 a share — well off its dizzying post-IPO heights. The company's market cap is $577.6 million compared to $18.46 billion for meat king Tyson (TSN), per Yahoo Finance comparison data."", '""In terms of what’s driving the US softness, it’s more of the same: Consumers just continue to shy away from the category for a variety of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or the lack thereof),"" JPMorgan packaged food analyst Ken Goldman said.', 'Goldman rates Beyond Meat shares Underweight, the equivalent of a Sell rating.', 'Meanwhile, Brown remains focused on defying the critics. Beyond Meat has recently opened a sprawling 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, Calif., steps away from the HQ of Barbie maker Mattel (MAT). The location is outfitted with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a generally open floor plan that may foster the next big thing in plant-based food.', 'The new facility even has a McDonald’s (MCD) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.', 'The 6-foot-5 Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries with highest coal consumption by year.', 'While the world is attempting to move away from coal consumption globally, the coal industry is not going down without a fight, especially in light of the recent energy crisis. In fact, in 2022, global coal consumption, undoubtedly led by the countries with the highest coal consumption by year, increased by 6.3% in 2022 as compared to the previous year. Most of this growth is led by emerging markets where industries are continuing to grow at a fast pace, with a growth of 8.8.% in China, 52% in Indonesia and 8.3% in India.', ""While advanced economies have been focusing on switching to renewable energy industries, Russia's war with Ukraine and the ensuing massive increase in natural gas prices have further shifted the focus to coal, which is why even Europe saw coal consumption increase by a modest 2.3% in 2022, led by Italy with saw an increase of 48%, followed by Germany (+3.5%) and Turkiye (+3.2%). On the other hand, other countries and regions across the world registered a significant decline with the U.S. seeing coal consumption fall by 5.1% in the U.S. while South Africa led a 6% drop in Africa. Currently, China is easily among the countries with the highest coal consumption by year, and along with India, is mostly responsible for Asia accounting for around 75% of total global coal consumption. Europe follows Asia by accounting for 14% of global coal consumption which itself is then followed by the U.S. for 6%."", ""An aerial view of an open cut coal mine, showing the vastness of the company's mining operations."", 'While the aforementioned statistics seem to bode well for the coal industry and the countries with the highest coal consumption by year, the truth is that the long-term future for coal is still uncertain, as the transition to green energy continues globally. In China, one of the biggest coal consumers and the biggest coal producer in the world, coal usage has stagnated in the past decade as the country aims to become the global hub for green technology and has been phasing out fossil fuel usage in favor of renewable energy. Meanwhile, lower natural gas prices led by the shale gas revolution also resulted in coal usage in the U.S. dropping significantly. According to the International Energy Agency, demand for coal will decline to 2026, even though 2023 has seen growth of 1.3%, allowing production to cross 8.5 billion tons for the first time. However, 2023 will see double digit drops of 10% in both the U.S. and the European Union, which will drive a decline of 2.3% in 2026 as compared to 2023.', 'Even now, major coal companies are missing earnings, with one such company being Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) whose reported EPS of $0.82 missed analyst expectations of $1.16 for Q3 2023. In its Q3 2023 earnings call, the CEO of Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) was still optimistic and stated ""In the third quarter of 2023, we delivered strong operational results with better-than-expected production and effective cost management. We also advanced initiatives at Shoal Creek in North Goonyella that illustrate our ongoing commitment to continue investing in our seaborne metallurgical portfolio. During the quarter, our Board approved full funding at North Goonyella for the completion of initial development through the commencement of longwall operations in 2026. We are also excited to announce that we have reached an agreement to acquire a large portion of the Wards Well coal deposit adjacent to our existing North Goonyella mine. This is a tremendous opportunity to extend a world-class coal deposit and leverage our existing infrastructure and equipment. Before I expand on the quarter, I want to thank our global employees for their continued focus and commitment to working safely and efficiently. Now, turning to the global coal markets. Seaborne thermal coal markets remained volatile during the quarter with modest pricing improvements. Robust, but moderating coal and natural gas inventories in the Northern Hemisphere have continued to weigh on demand for high-energy thermal coal, coupled with better supply prospects due to drier weather on Australia\'s East Coast, resulting in Newcastle coal trading within a range of $130 to $160 a ton. China\'s year-to-date imports of lower-grade thermal coals continue to significantly surpass the prior year, with an increase in the annual thermal coal input run rate of approximately 93% over 2022 levels. India has also increased seaborne market participation, as our power demand continues to grow. Recent import trends have led the IEA to report that elevated global demand for thermal coal imports so far during 2023 are pointing to 6% year-on-year growth in overall seaborne coal trade versus 2022. Within the seaborne metallurgical market, global crude steel output during the quarter continued to be variable, with weaker production rates in Europe and South America, offset by notable year-on-year crude steel production growth in some Asian markets.""', 'While the share price of Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) fell in the first three quarters, a late rebound in December means that its share price is where it was around a year ago. Meanwhile, another major coal company in Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR) has had a fantastic year where its share price jumped by 148% YTD 2023. This was achieved despite the declining price of coal, which was called out in the company\'s Q3 2023 earnings call, where it stated "" Realizations in the incidental thermal portion of the Met segment decreased to $92.22 per ton in Q3 as compared to $115.50 per ton in Q2 due to the lower market pricing for thermal coal. And all other category realizations were also down as a result of the declining pricing environment for thermal coal coming in at $68.32 for the third quarter, as compared to $99.66 per ton in the second quarter. Third quarter cost of coal sales for our Met segment increased to $109.95 per ton, up from $106.35 per ton in the second quarter. Cost of coal sales in the all-other category decreased quarter-over-quarter to $84.73 per ton as compared to $88.59 per ton in the second quarter 2023.""', 'Methodology', ""To rank the countries with the highest coal consumption by year, we considered data for each country for both 2020 and 2021, with said data obtained from BP's Statistic Review of World Energy.

But what can investors expect heading into 2024? Let's start with Ted Pick."", ""He's going to take the helm at Morgan Stanley on January 1 here. This is one that you've been tracking in this transition here."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. Some of the stories are starting to pop up on Ted Pick. Of course, an announcement was made a couple of weeks ago, really cool, really helpful, I should say, piece by the FT, looking at what some of the challenges that Pick has to confront.', ""Looking into next year, of course, Ted, coming up, I would say, more through the trading and investment banking side of the business, now Morgan Stanley under outgoing CEO James Gorman, who is staying as executive chairman for one year, he has really positioned Morgan Stanley into wealth management. So I think it's going to be important to see how Pick manages, really, what is now seen as the growth driver inside of Morgan Stanley in wealth management, just given the acquisitions he has made. But, Brad, also let's keep in mind that Pick takes this position."", 'Morgan Stanley shares are down about 12% since December 8. Really, continue to be under pressure one of the more underperforming stocks in the big banking space, as our very own David Hollerith, our senior banking reporter here has been writing about. So this stock is not doing well.', 'Some concerns of Pick can be like Gorman, who has really driven, really, a massive turnaround since he took over more than a decade. So it will be interesting to see if he can get through that. And a lot of regulatory issues over at Morgan.', ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And to this point, I mean, you've had a lot of the banking executives have to continue to make trips to Washington DC, discussing what Basel III Endgame could mean for capital requirements here.

Next up-- we have Starbucks with its new CEO Laxman Narasimhan looking to orchestrate a turnaround plan. And Brad, I continue to be very focused on how Lax handles the push to unionize Starbucks stores.', ""Now, Starbucks, in typical form, has-- I really think has brushed this aside as someone who has covered this company for close to 20 years, first under Howard Schultz. They typically push a lot of these issues to the back burner. They think because they're Starbucks, it's their world, and everybody gets to live in it. It's not working like that, has not worked like this in terms of the Union issue for more than a year."", 'I think Lax has to finally figure this out. Has to offer potentially some concessions.

I just didn't like that letter from Lax that you mentioned. It looks to be that he wants to continue using that Starbucks blog, like Howard Schultz long did weighing in on social issues."", ""I think for Lax to turn around investor sentiment, just be a good Starbucks, be a good operator, drive better results, be good to your employees, and let the results speak for themselves. You don't need to hop on to that Starbucks blog and try to be Howard Schultz light."", ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah, well, yeah, exactly. Howard Schultz, eventually, when he did leave Starbucks eventually, went on to go into politics for a brief stint, and very brief. Also here, we got to finally talk about Elon Musk from X to SpaceX. There's a lot on tap for 2024."", ""I think investors just want to know what is going to take place in 2024 that Elon Musk just places so much of his time around? Because that's going to have a broader overhang on what the stock actually does, what the margins look like. Is he ready honestly to continue to cut in order to just to get some of the Tesla models into driveways, into garages, into charging stations as well?"", 'Where does the network grow out in terms of the superchargers? Because that is the overhang for the amount of people who are looking to purchase or even finance. So where financing is even, perhaps, rosy, I dare. I say rosy because financing a vehicle, financing anything right now, not the most rosy environment.', ""But in the event somebody does still enter into a purchase of that vehicle, where do they then look across that network and feel confident? Because that's the hang up for a lot of people that were looking to buy an EV right now. Demand waning, a lot of the vehicle companies have had to pull back on some of their ambitions that they have as well."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: Among many things I'm watching, Brad, really, is how does Tesla perform potentially in another year where EV prices continue to fall? The used values of Tesla vehicles continue to decline. You also have GM and Ford continuing to roll out large number of EVs in this country and do so very aggressively. So, lots of concerns here, I think, on Tesla after a pretty good year.""]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries with highest coal consumption by year.', 'While the world is attempting to move away from coal consumption globally, the coal industry is not going down without a fight, especially in light of the recent energy crisis. In fact, in 2022, global coal consumption, undoubtedly led by the countries with the highest coal consumption by year, increased by 6.3% in 2022 as compared to the previous year. Most of this growth is led by emerging markets where industries are continuing to grow at a fast pace, with a growth of 8.8.% in China, 52% in Indonesia and 8.3% in India.', ""While advanced economies have been focusing on switching to renewable energy industries, Russia's war with Ukraine and the ensuing massive increase in natural gas prices have further shifted the focus to coal, which is why even Europe saw coal consumption increase by a modest 2.3% in 2022, led by Italy with saw an increase of 48%, followed by Germany (+3.5%) and Turkiye (+3.2%). On the other hand, other countries and regions across the world registered a significant decline with the U.S. seeing coal consumption fall by 5.1% in the U.S. while South Africa led a 6% drop in Africa. Currently, China is easily among the countries with the highest coal consumption by year, and along with India, is mostly responsible for Asia accounting for around 75% of total global coal consumption. Europe follows Asia by accounting for 14% of global coal consumption which itself is then followed by the U.S. for 6%."", ""An aerial view of an open cut coal mine, showing the vastness of the company's mining operations."", 'While the aforementioned statistics seem to bode well for the coal industry and the countries with the highest coal consumption by year, the truth is that the long-term future for coal is still uncertain, as the transition to green energy continues globally. In China, one of the biggest coal consumers and the biggest coal producer in the world, coal usage has stagnated in the past decade as the country aims to become the global hub for green technology and has been phasing out fossil fuel usage in favor of renewable energy. Meanwhile, lower natural gas prices led by the shale gas revolution also resulted in coal usage in the U.S. dropping significantly. According to the International Energy Agency, demand for coal will decline to 2026, even though 2023 has seen growth of 1.3%, allowing production to cross 8.5 billion tons for the first time. However, 2023 will see double digit drops of 10% in both the U.S. and the European Union, which will drive a decline of 2.3% in 2026 as compared to 2023.', 'Even now, major coal companies are missing earnings, with one such company being Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) whose reported EPS of $0.82 missed analyst expectations of $1.16 for Q3 2023. In its Q3 2023 earnings call, the CEO of Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) was still optimistic and stated ""In the third quarter of 2023, we delivered strong operational results with better-than-expected production and effective cost management. We also advanced initiatives at Shoal Creek in North Goonyella that illustrate our ongoing commitment to continue investing in our seaborne metallurgical portfolio. During the quarter, our Board approved full funding at North Goonyella for the completion of initial development through the commencement of longwall operations in 2026. We are also excited to announce that we have reached an agreement to acquire a large portion of the Wards Well coal deposit adjacent to our existing North Goonyella mine. This is a tremendous opportunity to extend a world-class coal deposit and leverage our existing infrastructure and equipment. Before I expand on the quarter, I want to thank our global employees for their continued focus and commitment to working safely and efficiently. Now, turning to the global coal markets. Seaborne thermal coal markets remained volatile during the quarter with modest pricing improvements. Robust, but moderating coal and natural gas inventories in the Northern Hemisphere have continued to weigh on demand for high-energy thermal coal, coupled with better supply prospects due to drier weather on Australia\'s East Coast, resulting in Newcastle coal trading within a range of $130 to $160 a ton. China\'s year-to-date imports of lower-grade thermal coals continue to significantly surpass the prior year, with an increase in the annual thermal coal input run rate of approximately 93% over 2022 levels. India has also increased seaborne market participation, as our power demand continues to grow. Recent import trends have led the IEA to report that elevated global demand for thermal coal imports so far during 2023 are pointing to 6% year-on-year growth in overall seaborne coal trade versus 2022. Within the seaborne metallurgical market, global crude steel output during the quarter continued to be variable, with weaker production rates in Europe and South America, offset by notable year-on-year crude steel production growth in some Asian markets.""', 'While the share price of Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) fell in the first three quarters, a late rebound in December means that its share price is where it was around a year ago. Meanwhile, another major coal company in Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (NYSE:AMR) has had a fantastic year where its share price jumped by 148% YTD 2023. This was achieved despite the declining price of coal, which was called out in the company\'s Q3 2023 earnings call, where it stated "" Realizations in the incidental thermal portion of the Met segment decreased to $92.22 per ton in Q3 as compared to $115.50 per ton in Q2 due to the lower market pricing for thermal coal. And all other category realizations were also down as a result of the declining pricing environment for thermal coal coming in at $68.32 for the third quarter, as compared to $99.66 per ton in the second quarter. Third quarter cost of coal sales for our Met segment increased to $109.95 per ton, up from $106.35 per ton in the second quarter. Cost of coal sales in the all-other category decreased quarter-over-quarter to $84.73 per ton as compared to $88.59 per ton in the second quarter 2023.""', 'Methodology', ""To rank the countries with the highest coal consumption by year, we considered data for each country for both 2020 and 2021, with said data obtained from BP's Statistic Review of World Energy.

These returns have crushed the otherwise impressive 24% gain for the S&P 500. And the explanation for Salesforce's outperformance can be simplistic."", 'In the earnings call for the fiscal third quarter of 2024, co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff started his commentary liberally, using words like ""unbelievable,"" ""incredible,"" and ""exciting."" And he was largely referring to Salesforce\'s cash flow.', ""In Q3, Salesforce had an operating cash flow of $1.5 billion, up a stunning 389% year over year. And to be clear, the company's cash-flow growth isn't entirely recent. The trend has been ongoing for years and is a big reason Salesforce stock has been a winner, as the chart below shows."", ""Could Salesforce's long-term cash-flow story continue in 2024 and beyond? Or will it come back down to earth? Well, the future is uncertain. But there are reasons to believe the company could keep gaining ground in the coming year. Here's why."", ""In general, 2023 has been a difficult year for enterprise software companies. And Salesforce's revenue growth has admittedly slowed to an all-time low. But through the first three quarters of its 2024 fiscal year, the company's revenue is still up 11.3% from the comparable period of fiscal 2023, which isn't too shabby."", ""In recent years, Salesforce has acquired other software companies, including Slack and Tableau. The company's broader range of products is leading to more services being bundled and larger contract values with customers."", ""Accordingly, Salesforce's million-dollar deals were up 80% year over year in Q3. And with these bigger deals, the company's remaining performance obligations (future revenue from existing contracts) are also growing nicely. It ended Q3 with remaining performance obligations of $48.3 billion, up 21% year over year."", ""Give Salesforce's management a lot of credit. Some of its impressive cash-flow growth has been driven by exercising discipline on spending. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, operating expenses were down 1.5% from the comparable period of fiscal 2023."", ""However, Salesforce's Q3 cash-flow performance was largely driven by higher-than-normal collections than what's customary during the third quarter. This is more of a timing issue than a material improvement to the business, which is something to be mindful of."", ""Collections will vary from quarter to quarter, so this isn't a material part of the investment thesis for Salesforce. To grow cash flow, therefore, the company can grow revenue, cut expenses, or facilitate a combination of the two."", ""Looking at expenses, Salesforce is already putting up impressive numbers, so it feels greedy to expect it to do much more than it already is. Just look at the chart of the company's operating margin over the last decade."", ""Therefore, if it's going to grow cash flow, I believe it's more important for investors to think about Salesforce's revenue growth potential. And, as mentioned, there's reason for optimism."", ""Salesforce has been piloting new products built on its artificial intelligence\xa0(AI) software. But as of Dec. 14, it's making its AI generally available through a package called Unlimited Edition+ (UE+).\xa0UE+ plays on the current customer trend of bundling more Salesforce services into one contract."", 'According to management, Salesforce customers who switch to UE+ increase their spending by 70%. That is a huge revenue growth opportunity just within its current customer base.', ""In short, the trends regarding revenue growth in the coming year are in Salesforce's favor. The company's customers want to bundle more services, so it now offers UE+ to its entire base. And so far, customers switching to UE+ have spent significantly more money. If Salesforce's management can maintain financial discipline, it's very possible the company's cash flow will continue growing as it's done over the long term."", ""Currently trading at roughly 30 times its free cash flow, Salesforce stock isn't necessarily cheap in absolute terms. But the chart below does show that this is about the cheapest it's ever been."", ""In conclusion, it's unrealistic to expect Salesforce stock to double in value two years in a row. But on its current path, I believe it very well could deliver positive returns in the coming year and beyond, meaning its shareholders would do well to keep holding, even after the impressive gains in 2023."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Salesforce wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

EMR is benefiting from healthy demand across most end markets and accretive acquisitions. The company’s shareholder-friendly policies are encouraging.Let’s delve into the factors that make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company a smart investment choice at the moment.End-Market Strength: Strong demand in the process and hybrid markets is boosting EMR’s underlying orders. The company anticipates sales in the process and hybrid end markets to increase in mid to high single-digits in fiscal 2024 (ending September 2024), driven by energy security, sustainability and decarbonization, nearshoring and digital transformation. Also, a robust demand environment and improving supply chains are supporting underlying sales growth.Given the strength across its end markets, Emerson has provided a bullish forecast for fiscal 2024. The company expects net sales to increase 14-17.5% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending December 2023). Underlying sales are expected to increase 6.5-8.5%. For fiscal 2024, the company expects net sales to increase 13-15.5% year over year. Underlying sales are anticipated to increase 4-6% in the same period.Business Strength: Solid momentum in the measurement, analytical and final control businesses due to strong demand in the hybrid and process end markets is aiding the Intelligent Devices business unit. Revenues from the unit increased 7% year over year in fiscal 2023 (ended September 2023). Improved supply chains, easier availability of electronic components and strong backlogs are driving the growth of the Software and Control business group. Revenues from the unit jumped 20% year over year in fiscal 2023.Expansion Efforts: The company’s expansion initiative is expected to drive its growth. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Emerson acquired Afag and Flexim. The acquisition of Afag expands Emerson’s capabilities in factory automation, helping the company expand into lucrative end markets, which include battery manufacturing, automotive, packaging, medical, life sciences and electronics. The acquisition of Flexim adds to EMR’s existing flow measurement positions in coriolis, differential pressure, magmeter and vortex flow measurement and expands its automation portfolio and measurement capabilities.Also, in October 2023, Emerson completed the acquisition of National Instruments for $8.2 billion. The acquisition is in sync with the company’s focus on global automation to drive growth and profitability. The buyout strengthens EMR’s global automation foothold, helping the company expand into high-growth end markets, including semiconductor and electronics, transportation and electric vehicles and aerospace and defense.Rewards to Shareholders: The company’s measures to reward its shareholders through dividend payments are noteworthy. In fiscal 2023, the company paid dividends of $1.2 billion. In November 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 1%. EMR plans to repurchase shares worth $500 million in fiscal 2024.Northward Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EMR’s fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised 6.2% upward in the past 60 days.', 'Emerson Electric Co. price-consensus-chart | Emerson Electric Co.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) share price has flown 266% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. In the last week shares have slid back 1.3%.', ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' View our latest analysis for Marathon Oil ', 'While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""Marathon Oil became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly."", 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', 'We know that Marathon Oil has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Marathon Oil stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.', ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Marathon Oil's TSR for the last 3 years was 282%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Investors in Marathon Oil had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.5% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 27%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Marathon Oil (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", 'If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Three key factors are working together to improve the chances of that becoming a reality.', ""2024 hasn't yet started, but some companies are already projecting bigger payouts for 2024 than they gave investors in 2023. Canadian energy pipeline giant Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), for instance, declared a 3.1% increase in its quarterly dividend that's payable in March. That increase marks 29 consecutive years of rising payouts, which is a testament to the company's stable cash flow."", ""While there are open questions about the long-term future of natural gas and oil as energy sources, those fuels should remain in demand over the next few decades. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's outlook projects roughly stable demand for both fuel types through 2050."", ""Stable demand for decades is a perfect environment for slow and steady dividend growth from an already-established pipeline giant like Enbridge because it can continue to leverage its existing installed capacity. If it's not investing much in expansion, it can improve its cash flow (and ability to pay dividends) by paying down debt over time."", ""In addition to planned payout increases for 2024, there's also the carryforward effect for companies that increased their dividends in mid-2023. As long as they can maintain their new, higher rates in 2024, more dividends will be paid in 2024 than in 2023."", 'For instance, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) paid a $0.68 per-share dividend each quarter for the first three quarters of 2023, then increased it to $0.75 for the fourth quarter. As long as that $0.75 rate is maintained throughout 2024, its total dividend of $3 per share for 2024 will be larger than the $2.79 it paid in 2023.', ""Thanks to Microsoft's leading position in artificial intelligence, along with its already strong operating systems and office productivity software lines, maintaining that dividend should be feasible. Its dividend only consumes around 27% of the company's earnings. Microsoft might even continue increasing that payment in 2024, thanks to its modest payout ratio and anticipated solid earnings growth."", 'Back in August, I accumulated around $12,000 in cash -- mostly from dividends from other investments -- that I decided to invest in Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ: FITB). Shortly after I made that purchase, Fifth Third Bancorp decided to boost its quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share per quarter, up from its previous $0.33 level.', 'With that boost, the 486 shares I bought are now projected to pay $680.40 in dividends in my first year of ownership. These dividends were generated by an investment funded by previous dividends -- and a great example of how compounding can come to life.', ""Of course, banks are tough to value, and the Silicon Valley Bank collapse earlier this year spooked investors when it came to smaller banks. That's a key reason I was able to buy Fifth Third Bancorp's shares at what looked like a reasonable value."", ""On top of that value price, Fifth Third Bancorp was paying interest rates on CDs that were below what the overall market offered, and that attracted me. Banks advertise higher interest rates as a way to attract deposits. The fact that Fifth Third Bancorp didn't feel the need to compete on yield suggested to me that it felt comfortable with its capital structure and balance-sheet strength."", 'Beginning Jan. 1, 2024, new IRA contribution limits open up for the new year. For 2024, the standard limit for IRAs is $7,000 per person under age 50 or $8,000 for those ages 50 and up.', 'I plan to put my 2024 IRA contributions toward companies that pay dividends, have increased their dividends, and look capable of continuing to increase those payments. That adds new capital to the amount being put toward that strategy.', 'Like a snowball rolling down a mountain, dividend compounding starts out small but has the potential to grow pretty large over time. To get to that point, though, you need to take those small initial steps by investing in companies with that potential.', ""Make today the day you start seeking out companies that could serve as the beginning of your own personal compounding machine. If they're able to deliver on those prospects over time, you could find yourself waking up some day very glad you took those steps."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

Three companies in particular are in focus for many investors next year — Morgan Stanley (MS), Starbucks (SBUX), and Tesla (TSLA).', 'Morgan Stanley will have new leadership in CEO Ted Pick, succeeding James Gorman who will stay on as executive chairman for one year. Pick has been with the company since 1990, starting as an analyst and was involved in capital-raising activities during the 2008 financial crisis.', 'Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan will face ongoing challenges in handling growing unionization efforts across Starbucks locations nationwide. Ongoing union pushes and calls for boycotts, which have reportedly cost the coffee chain $11 billion in value, will be an uphill battle for Narasimhan.', ""Lastly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk will be under close watch as multiple headwinds for the company mount including massive recalls, unionization efforts in Europe, and Musk's time spent as leader of multiple companies including the Boring Company and X.com (formerly Twitter)."", 'Yahoo Finance Anchors Brad Smith and Brian Sozzi break down the latest developments with these company leaders and the challenges they will face in 2024.', 'For more Yahoo Finance coverage of Tesla:', 'Tesla: Is Elon Musk too distracted by his other companies?', 'Catalysts for Tesla stock in 2024', ""Tesla is 'the AI company': Analyst"", ""Tesla: Car buyers missing out 'because they don't like Elon'"", ""Musk's social commentary hurting Tesla, other brands: Bill George"", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '[AUDIO LOGO]', ""BRAD SMITH: It's been a difficult year for leadership companies as companies grapple with high inflation and shaky economic backdrops. But what can investors expect heading into 2024? Let's start with Ted Pick."", ""He's going to take the helm at Morgan Stanley on January 1 here. This is one that you've been tracking in this transition here."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. Some of the stories are starting to pop up on Ted Pick. Of course, an announcement was made a couple of weeks ago, really cool, really helpful, I should say, piece by the FT, looking at what some of the challenges that Pick has to confront.', ""Looking into next year, of course, Ted, coming up, I would say, more through the trading and investment banking side of the business, now Morgan Stanley under outgoing CEO James Gorman, who is staying as executive chairman for one year, he has really positioned Morgan Stanley into wealth management. So I think it's going to be important to see how Pick manages, really, what is now seen as the growth driver inside of Morgan Stanley in wealth management, just given the acquisitions he has made. But, Brad, also let's keep in mind that Pick takes this position."", 'Morgan Stanley shares are down about 12% since December 8. Really, continue to be under pressure one of the more underperforming stocks in the big banking space, as our very own David Hollerith, our senior banking reporter here has been writing about. So this stock is not doing well.', 'Some concerns of Pick can be like Gorman, who has really driven, really, a massive turnaround since he took over more than a decade. So it will be interesting to see if he can get through that. And a lot of regulatory issues over at Morgan.', ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And to this point, I mean, you've had a lot of the banking executives have to continue to make trips to Washington DC, discussing what Basel III Endgame could mean for capital requirements here. It'd be interesting to see the tone that Ted Pick needs to strike with a lot of those regulators going into next year as well."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: All right. Next up-- we have Starbucks with its new CEO Laxman Narasimhan looking to orchestrate a turnaround plan. And Brad, I continue to be very focused on how Lax handles the push to unionize Starbucks stores.', ""Now, Starbucks, in typical form, has-- I really think has brushed this aside as someone who has covered this company for close to 20 years, first under Howard Schultz. They typically push a lot of these issues to the back burner. They think because they're Starbucks, it's their world, and everybody gets to live in it. It's not working like that, has not worked like this in terms of the Union issue for more than a year."", 'I think Lax has to finally figure this out. Has to offer potentially some concessions. Because the alternative, as you see on the stock chart, this union issue will continue to weigh on Starbucks shares for the foreseeable future if he does not get out in front of this finally once and for all.', ""BRAD SMITH: Plus, Internationally, you've got to think about what the expansion plan looks like and what Laxman is going to continue to push for as of right now. I mean, we just came weeks off of what his international scope and what was perhaps defined as a cold brew type of employee memo that he put out from the desk of the CEO. And essentially, looking out at some of the exogenous risks that exist."", ""Sure, they do exist. But at the end of the day, it's also the mark of a leader in those times, how you're bringing your customers, your employees, the rest of the management team through that, and continuing to grow out the business and the prospects there."", ""And I think China is one area where investors have continued to ask the question of where will they ensure that they maintain the market share they've developed while also improving the brand sentiment within that particular region as well."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: I'll just say real quickly here, Brad, before we jump to one other one. I just didn't like that letter from Lax that you mentioned. It looks to be that he wants to continue using that Starbucks blog, like Howard Schultz long did weighing in on social issues."", ""I think for Lax to turn around investor sentiment, just be a good Starbucks, be a good operator, drive better results, be good to your employees, and let the results speak for themselves. You don't need to hop on to that Starbucks blog and try to be Howard Schultz light."", ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah, well, yeah, exactly. Howard Schultz, eventually, when he did leave Starbucks eventually, went on to go into politics for a brief stint, and very brief. Also here, we got to finally talk about Elon Musk from X to SpaceX. There's a lot on tap for 2024."", ""I think investors just want to know what is going to take place in 2024 that Elon Musk just places so much of his time around? Because that's going to have a broader overhang on what the stock actually does, what the margins look like. Is he ready honestly to continue to cut in order to just to get some of the Tesla models into driveways, into garages, into charging stations as well?"", 'Where does the network grow out in terms of the superchargers? Because that is the overhang for the amount of people who are looking to purchase or even finance. So where financing is even, perhaps, rosy, I dare. I say rosy because financing a vehicle, financing anything right now, not the most rosy environment.', ""But in the event somebody does still enter into a purchase of that vehicle, where do they then look across that network and feel confident? Because that's the hang up for a lot of people that were looking to buy an EV right now. Demand waning, a lot of the vehicle companies have had to pull back on some of their ambitions that they have as well."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: Among many things I'm watching, Brad, really, is how does Tesla perform potentially in another year where EV prices continue to fall? The used values of Tesla vehicles continue to decline. You also have GM and Ford continuing to roll out large number of EVs in this country and do so very aggressively. So, lots of concerns here, I think, on Tesla after a pretty good year.""]"

The drive-thru coffee chain went public in 2021, jumped 108% within about a month, and promptly plunged. It's now nearly 60% off its highs."", ""There has been a mix of factors leading to the poor stock performance, and there are plenty of reasons to envision it becoming a star stock. Here's why things could turn around in 2024."", ""Starbucks has changed the way people consume their morning coffee, making it an all-day event and a reason to gather. The company is undergoing its own transformation right now, but it has paved the way for other chains to leverage the trend and create a differentiated coffee shop culture. That's the theory behind Dutch Bros."", ""Dutch Bros has a friendly, customer-oriented culture with a focus on quality service and speedy preparation. Its beverages aren't essentially different than those from other coffee shops, but they come with their own spin and interesting names like Double Torture and Annihilator. They also offer cold drinks."", 'The company has made a name for itself in the markets it serves, which as of the end of the third quarter include 16 states in the Western and Southern United States. It operates 794 stores, most of which are company-owned, but about a third of which are franchised, and it sees the opportunity for 4,000 stores over the next eight years or so.', 'That itself will be a robust revenue driver. Dutch Bros has reported solid double-digit sales growth since it went public, and most of that is coming from new stores. It opened 39 locations in the third quarter, with plans for 150 total for the year.', 'In that way, it looks like a no-brainer stock to buy right now. In eight years, when it could own several thousand stores, revenue will be exponentially higher than it is today, and that will lead to stock growth.', 'So why has Dutch Bros stock plunged so far off its highs?', ""Everyone knows the statistics about how many small businesses fail. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20% of small businesses fail in their first year, and only 33% remain by their 10th year. Even fabulous business ideas won't make it if they're not shepherded to the finish line with competent management and efficient operations."", ""Dutch Bros has a lot going for it, but it's facing strong headwinds due to inflation. It's a young start-up with a bright future, but it's untested in this challenging economy. Starbucks has a long history of experience and the resources and sheer size to withstand these times, but Dutch Bros is still trying to make a go of it. That leads to high pressure -- and, for confident investors, incredible opportunity."", ""One place Dutch Bros is having trouble is in growing its comparable-store sales (comps). This is an important metric for retailers and restaurants because it demonstrates how happy customers are and if they're returning. That speaks to the long-term viability of the business."", 'It also leads to expanding margins since many of the expenses of running a restaurant are fixed, and each sale, or higher sale, leads to more-efficient use of fixed costs and higher profits.', 'Dutch Bros recently announced that its founder and leader is handing over the reins to an experienced food executive. That creates some uncertainty as it transitions, but it ultimately looks like the right move to bring the company to the next level.', 'As inflation eases, customers might be able to spend more money on little luxuries like a custom-made beverage, and that should result in accelerating comps growth in 2024.', ""At the current price, Dutch Bros stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of just under 2. That's a reasonable valuation for a company with its growth rate. As it continues to post high growth and positive net income, it looks more likely to rebound and become a stable, expanding business."", ""However, it's not without risk. Dutch Bros could be a standout stock in 2024, but risk-averse investors should wait for more sustained profitability and comps growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dutch Bros wasn't one of them.

The company has since changed its name to Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST), and expansion into energy drinks led to such significant share price appreciation that the company has split its stock five times in the last 20 years, as detailed below:', 'August 2005: 2-for-1 stock split.', 'July 2006: 4-for-1 stock split.', 'February 2012: 2-for-1 stock split.', 'November 2016: 3-for-1 stock split.', 'March 2003: 2-for-1-stock split.', 'Shares of Hansen Natural/Monster Beverage soared 65,610% over the last two decades, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during that time.

But the company also makes money from various alcoholic beverages, mostly craft beers and hard seltzers acquired through its purchase of CANarchy in February 2022. However, Monster recently expanded into flavored malt beverages (The Beast Unleashed), and it will launch a line of hard teas in 2024 (Nasty Beast Hard Tea).', 'Monster has two important competitive advantages. First, the company has built immense brand authority through effective marketing, and it has maintained that brand authority through regular innovation. The company added more than a dozen products to its energy drink portfolio in the third quarter alone. Second, an exclusive partnership with Coca-Cola positions Monster as the only energy drink brand with access to the largest beverage distribution system in the world.', 'Those advantages have helped Monster achieve a leadership position in many geographies. Red Bull is the most popular energy drink brand in the U.S., but when all brands are included, Monster Beverage Corporation is the market leader in the U.S. (the largest economy in the world). The company also leads the market in energy drink sales in Japan (the third-largest economy in the world). , South Korea, and parts of Latin America', 'Monster reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 14% to $1.9 billion despite a 180-basis-point headwind from unfavorable foreign exchange rates. That top-line figure reflects sales increases of 13% and 58% in energy drinks and alcoholic beverages, respectively.', 'Growth was particularly pronounced outside of North America. Monster continued to gain market share across Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany (the fourth-largest economy in the world). And management is optimistic about future growth prospects in China (the second-largest economy in the world).', 'Monster also reported GAAP net income of $0.43 per diluted share, up 41% from the prior year. That bottom line momentum can be attributed to gross margin expansion brought on by pricing power, as well as cost control efforts and share repurchases. Investors can expect similar results in the future.', 'Global energy drink sales are forecast to increase at 8.3% annually through 2030. But Monster could grow more quickly for two reasons. First, the company has historically outpaced the industry average in energy drink sales, as evidenced by its leading market share, and its strong brand should keep that momentum alive in the years ahead.', 'Second, its alcoholic beverages business is growing much more quickly than its energy drinks business, and that trend should continue as the company leans into new flavored malt beverages and hard tea products. Monster expects to achieve national distribution with The Beast Unleashed by the end of 2023, and management is targeting similar coverage with Nasty Beast Hard Tea in the first half of 2024.', 'Collectively, Monster has a good shot at annual revenue growth ranging from high single-digits to low double-digits through the end of the decade.

The recovery in group and business transient demand for the company’s well-located properties in markets with strong demand drivers positions it well for growth. Also, aggressive capital-recycling efforts and a healthy balance sheet augur well.Shares of this Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) have gained 25.7% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry's rise of 7.3%.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has been raised 1.1% over the past month."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Healthy Operating Performance: Host Hotels has a strong Sunbelt exposure and presence in the top 20 U.S. markets. Its properties are advantageously located in central business districts of major cities with proximity to airports and resort/conference destinations.The improvement in group and business transient travel demand has aided occupancy and revenue per available (RevPAR) growth at the company’s properties lately. From the beginning of 2023 through Sep 30, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 10.4% from the 2022 levels. Given the healthy demand for Host Hotels properties in strategic locations, it is likely to witness healthy operating performance in the upcoming period.For 2023, management expects comparable hotel RevPAR growth to be between 7.25% and 8.75%. We expect the metric to exhibit year-over-year growth of 7.8% this year.Capital-Recycling Efforts: Over the years, the company has made concerted efforts to dispose of non-strategic assets that have lower growth potential or properties with significant capital expenditure requirements through its capital-recycling program. It has redeployed the proceeds to acquire or invest in better-yielding assets, highlighting its prudent capital-management practices.It has also broadened its acquisition focus to include urban markets beyond the top 25 in search of higher portfolio EBITDA and revenues. Per the company’s November 2023 Investor Presentation, from 2021 through the end of the third quarter of 2023, total dispositions amounted to $1.53 billion, which is 17.5 times the EBITDA multiple. Its acquisitions during this period amounted to $1.87 billion, which is 13.1 times the EBITDA multiple.Capital Expenditure: Host Hotels is focused on undertaking strategic capital allocations to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen its position in the United States, where it has a greater scale and competitive advantage. From the beginning of 2023 through Sep 30, the company has incurred $472 million of capital expenditure. For 2023, HST expects to incur capital expenditure in the range of $615-$695 million.Notably, the REIT reached an agreement with Hyatt to complete transformational reinvestment capital projects at six properties in its portfolio, intended to position the targeted hotels to compete better in their respective markets and enhance long-term performance. Of the total investment of $500-$600 million, it expects to invest nearly $125-$200 million per year over the next three to four years on this program. Such efforts seem encouraging.Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Strength:\xa0 Host Hotels maintains a healthy balance sheet and had $2.6 billion of total available liquidity as of Sep 30, 2023. Moreover, it is the only company with an investment-grade rating among lodging REITs. It enjoys investment-grade ratings of Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from both Fitch and S&P Global, rendering access to the debt market at favorable costs. Hence, with ample financial flexibility and no material debt maturities until April 2024, the REIT is well-positioned to carry on with its growth endeavors.HST’s current cash flow growth is projected at 71.75% compared with 8.07% growth estimated for the industry. In addition, its trailing 12-month return on equity is 11.01% compared with the industry’s average of 3.08%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Dividends: Solid dividend payouts are the biggest attraction for REIT investors, and Host Hotels remained committed to that. After a brief suspension of its dividend payments during the pandemic, the company reinstated its dividend payment and resorted to regular dividend hikes. This December, it announced an 11% hike in its dividend payout, bringing it on par with the pre-pandemic level of 20 cents per share. This reaffirms shareholders’ confidence in this lodging REIT.Encouragingly, Host Hotels has increased its dividend eight times in the last five years.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has been raised nearly 1% over the past month.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""Let us now decipher the factors behind the increase in the stock price and check whether the trend will last.The retail real estate market fundamentals have remained solid in 2023. Retailers were seen renting out more physical store spaces to meet the growing consumer demand. As a result, Simon Property’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad experienced solid leasing activity, driving occupancy levels and rent growth across its portfolio.In the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, the company signed 922 new leases and 1,440 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio.The occupancy for this portfolio improved 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 95.2% as of Sep 30, 2023. The base minimum rent per square foot for this portfolio was $56.41 as of the same date, up from $54.80 recorded a year ago.Retail real fundamentals will likely remain strong in the upcoming period, benefiting retail REITs like Simon Property. The company’s healthy leasing pipeline and continued broad-based demand from the retail community across several categories will drive its performance.Simon Property’s adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers have paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omnichannel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. The company is also focused on tapping its growth opportunities by assisting digital brands enhance their brick-and-mortar presence.Also, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, has enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.The retail REIT maintains a healthy balance sheet position and had $8.8 billion of liquidity as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The fixed-charge coverage ratio was 4.5 as of Sep 30, 2023, well ahead of the required level.SPG also enjoys a corporate investment-grade credit rating of A- (stable outlook) from Standard and Poor's and a senior unsecured rating of A3 (stable outlook) from Moody’s, rendering it favorable access to the debt market. The company’s solid financial footing with ample financial flexibility is likely to support its growth endeavors going forward.In addition, SPG’s trailing 12-month return on equity is 64.91% compared with the industry’s average of 4.50%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Solid dividend payouts are a massive enticement for REIT investors, and SPG has remained committed to boosting shareholder wealth even during the pandemic. Encouragingly, the company has raised its dividend payout 10 times in the last five years, with the latest hike being announced in August 2023, concurrent with the second-quarter 2023 earnings release. Check out Simon Property’s dividend history here.Given SPG’s solid operating platform, opportunities for growth and a decent financial position compared with the industry, we expect the dividend rate to be sustainable in the upcoming period.Nonetheless, growing e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates may pose key near-term concerns for the company."", 'Some better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Realty Income O, Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and TANGER INC SKT.

If you want to read about some more stocks in the Mark Cuban portfolio, go directly to Mark Cuban Stock Portfolio: 5 Stocks To Consider.', 'Mark Cuban is known for many things. He is a famous television personality for appearances on a startup funding show called Shark Tank. He is also an angel investor, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Up until a few weeks ago, Cuban was also the majority owner of basketball team Dallas Mavericks. Over the past few decades, Cuban has earned the respect of the finance world by turning his investments into a multi-billion dollar empire. His first claim to fame was selling video portal Broadcast to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in 1999.\xa0', 'Cuban recently pulled off a similar coup with his basketball team. In the year 2000, just after his first big sale, Cuban bought the Dallas Mavericks for $285 million. Earlier this week, the NBA approved the sale of the company to a Las Vegas casino family for $3.5 billion. Cuban, after selling his majority stake in the team, has pocketed more than $3 billion from the trade. Despite the sale, Cuban maintains a minor ownership stake in the team and also retains the control over basketball operations. He has said the deal will bring in more revenue for the team.\xa0', 'Even though Mark Cuban is more than sixty years old, his investment philosophy closely mirrors that of a new generation of stock traders at the market who are bullish on high growth themes such as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and technology in general. Cuban is worth more than $6 billion and some of the top stocks to consider in his investment portfolio include e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), streaming leader Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and tech behemoth Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\xa0', 'Cuban has been bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) for many years, backing the shares to go higher on multiple occasions during interviews. In 2019, he disclosed that he owned close to $1 billion worth of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock that he had purchased for a split-adjusted price of $25 to $35 per share. As of December 29, the multinational tech firm trades at over $153 per share. Cuban noted how ecommerce was changing how retailers did business because of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\xa0', '“Obviously, online matters. Ecommerce has had the impact that everybody expected it to. I think traditional retailers, brick-and-mortar retailers, had hoped there would be ways to work around it, and some have found some solutions. But it’s not business as usual anymore, and if you opened up a store 10 years ago when rents were significantly higher and your rents escalate, you’re in trouble. And it is hard to regenerate traffic. Yeah you have an online component but if you have a thousand locations [stores] that is going to dominate your business.”', 'Cramer also picked up on the artificial intelligence trend at the stock long before other investors, identifying Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one his top picks in the space. In a LinkedIn interview last year, he identified AI as one of the sectors that young investors should target for future growth. In early 2021, via\xa0 a post on social networking platform X, Cuban said the foundation of his investing strategy was how good a company was at AI, noting Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was part of an AI Squad that was the best at it.\xa0', 'The “AI Squad”. The companies that have harnessed AI the best are the companies dominating.\xa0 To paraphrase a great movie line, “They keep getting smarter while everyone else stays the same “ It’s the foundation of how I invest in stocks these days. “How good is the company at AI”', 'Our Methodology', 'It is important to clarify that the stocks listed below were picked from the public comments that Cuban has made on his investments.

The list is compiled according to the number of hedge funds having stakes in each firm. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Here is what the fund said:', '“Fidelity National Financial (“FNF”) is the largest title insurance agency in the United States and a leading provider of title-related real estate transaction services. FNF also owns 85% of F&G Annuities, a life insurance and annuity business. Real estate transaction volume is tied to the interest rate cycle; therefore, title insurers are cyclical and often dismissed as bad businesses. FNF’s title profits will likely decline by over 50% in 2023, a cyclical trough, versus profits in 2021, a cyclical peak. Lumpiness in FNF’s title profits is to be expected, yet investors over-extrapolate FNF’s earnings power to the upside and downside. Since 2021, FNF’s stock peaked at ~$50 per share and troughed at ~$32 per share, a greater than 60% dispersion in equity valuation (including share repurchase accounting but excluding spin-offs).', 'Though volume is cyclical, real estate transactions are a constant feature of the American economy and FNF’s title profits will normalize. FNF earns the highest title margins in the industry and remained profitable this year despite the challenging operating environment. This is important because title fees are regulated at the state and local level, restricting excessive take rates, so effective expense management is essential. Fee regulation entrenches the title market’s status quo because returns on capital are good but not high enough to justify new competition.

Given that we are looking at Amgen as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.886. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Public Service Enterprise Group is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.087 = US$3.8b ÷ (US$50b - US$5.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, Public Service Enterprise Group has an ROCE of 8.7%.

The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 57% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward."", ""In summary, we're delighted to see that Public Service Enterprise Group has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a solid 42% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue."", ""One more thing: We've identified   3 warning signs  with Public Service Enterprise Group (at least 2 which are concerning)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful."", ""While Public Service Enterprise Group may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$258). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 3.9% of Phebe Novakovic's holding."", 'Over the last year we saw more insider selling of General Dynamics shares, than buying.

NASDAQ 100 missed that record just by a hair. But it's impressive to see how all of these have stacked up and come to record highs throughout the year. And up first was the tech sector. And what's really interesting is that tech and homebuilders went neck and neck. The mag seven, for all of what we talked about them were met with several homebuilders stocks, and I'll show you that in a second, that were just going up with them into July. Then there was a period of recess, and then they ended up exploding in November, December and that's what we're looking at now."", ""But we're also seeing chip stocks that stocks at a record high 67% for the year. Covered homebuilders and tech want to talk about infrastructure. We got Pave, that's up 37%, or 30.7%. European financials, the Dow, you look at defense and aerospace, that's the ITA, ETF. Gold, we were just talking about that reaching a record the other day. And also insurance, although this peaked a couple of weeks ago."", ""So these are all record highs within the month of December. And these are individual stocks. This covers everything in the S&P 500, the NASDAQ 100, and meme stocks. So it's not completely representative of all US stocks, but it's pretty close. What's really interesting, I was talking about the homebuilders. Here, here's builder. This is highly levered to the building sector, and we can see this is a stock that rose through July, had a little bit of a comeback there to the downside, and then really went off to the races starting in November."", ""That's very similar to this chart of Apple. I'm just going to show you the market cap weighted view here. Very, very similar charts. Apple didn't quite surge as much as some of the others as part of the year end sprint here, but definitely worth writing home about, up almost 50%. Let me go back to the equal weighted and just show you what a broad swath of industries we have seen these record highs take place in."", ""So PulteGroup, that's number two. That's also in construction. But then we have Pan W, Palo Alto networks, the software company up 111%. Chip stock, AVGO, Broadcom. Then we have FICO, Fair Isaac, that's in the financial sector. And it goes down the line. Booking, here's one, up 76%. This stock pretty impressive, completely different industry than the others we've been talking about. We got Lennar, another home builder up 65%."", ""What's been interesting too is to see some of these smaller or these less, these smaller return stocks really finally come into their records towards the end of the year. Here's General Dynamics. It's only up 4% for the year, and you can see it spent almost the entire year in the red, but it is finally climbed back here. And if you look at a Mac's chart you can see, this is, they build submarines, but this has been a volatile stock throughout the pandemic. But nevertheless at a record high here."", ""Here's another one Textron up 14%. AME up 18%. Let's take a look at Ross Stores. This is a retail name. Let's take a look at the year to date. I think this was in the red for much of the year, then we came alive starting just before September, and then really exploded towards the end of the year."", ""I guess the closing comment here is, you can't really predict what's going to happen at the beginning of the year with a lot of certainty, because I don't think anybody would have expected this towards the beginning. I will say, however, we are still in the midst of the Santa Claus rally. If we do manage these last five trading days of the old year and the first two of the new year, if we manage to close green, that's somewhat predictive of a year end close in 2024.

However, instead of super-normal rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. The GARP strategy considers growth rates between 10% and 40% ideal.Another metric considered by growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors but it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.

These risks and uncertainties could require NEP to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP\'s ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by the performance of its renewable energy projects which could be impacted by wind and solar conditions and in certain circumstances by market prices; operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects and pipelines involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output or capacity, personal injury or loss of life; NEP\'s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather; NEP depends on certain of the renewable energy projects and pipelines in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; NEP may pursue the repowering of renewable energy projects and could expose NEP to project development risks; geopolitical factors, terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events could impact NEP\'s projects, pipelines or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; the ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP\'s insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP\'s projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP\'s business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP\'s cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP\'s renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the subsidiaries\' of NEP that directly own the natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between the U.S. and Mexico; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP\'s rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP\'s operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and Mexico; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; if the energy production by or availability of NEP\'s renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP\'s growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; reductions in demand for natural gas in the U.S. or Mexico and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP\'s pipeline operations and cash flows; government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP\'s growth strategy; NEP\'s growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc.

107,6239c006-4e0f-3d0e-9ce5-959dbd0f4722,TSN,2023-12-29,Beyond Meat: How the plant-based CEO leads an uphill battle,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/beyond-meat-plant-based-ceo-203007194.html,1703800807,VIDEO,"['TGT', 'TSN', 'NOMD', 'BYND']","['Ethan Brown is one of the leaders taking on the meat industry, as Founder and CEO of Beyond Meat (BYND). Brown has managed to make deals with brands like Target (TGT) and Dunkin Donuts, and in May of 2019 he took the company public as part of the plant-based meat boom.', 'Brown invited Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to Beyond Meat headquarters in El Segundo, CA to share insights on what it takes to lead the company through the challenges of competing in the meat industry and the qualities that keep him going, like building a trustworthy team, focusing on the company’s true mission of changing how consumers consume meat, and embracing failure along the way.', '“We have to figure out how to get people comfortable with quick iteration, quick failure, and then quick recovery,” says Brown. “It’s a big part of our culture.”', 'Beyond Meat is not the only brand in the plant-based meat space, with many competitors, including Nomad (NOMD) and Impossible Foods. Traditional meat companies, like Tyson (TSN) and Cargill, are also adding plant-based meat offerings. Brown is aware of this reality and leads to create a sense of urgency within the company.', ""“There's always somebody that's working really hard,” Brown says. “If it doesn't motivate you enough to just bring this goodness to the world, you know, competition can also motivate you.”"", 'Lead This Way is a new series that features personal, in-depth interviews with the business leaders shaping our world today. In these one-on-one conversations, they reveal how their approach to leadership helped them reach the top of their field.', 'For more of our Lead This Way series, click here, and tune in to Yahoo Finance every Thursday at 3 p.m. ET.', 'ETHAN BROWN: People can say what they want, but we just keep doing the work. You just keep repeating and envisioning that and helping the team to see that. You can get through almost anything.', '[MUSIC PLAYING]', ""BRIAN SOZZI: Beyond Meat and its CEO Ethan Brown burst onto the scene with a sizzling IPO at the NASDAQ on May 2, 2019. The company's market valuation quickly surpassed $14 billion, as seemingly everyone was excited about the future of plant-based meat. There were deals with Target, Dunkin' Donuts, you name it, everyone wanted a piece of Beyond Meat."", ""ETHAN BROWN: Every reason that we started this company and every reason that the consumers are reaching for a product, strengthens every single day. It's hard not to be passionate about it because you can help so many people. We know that people love animal protein, right?"", 'And so if we can create that directly from plants in a way that eliminates the animal, get the taste exactly right, make sure that people understand the health benefits, and the third is get the price to the point where it is at parity or below that of animal protein. This transition will occur, and it will start to occur more quickly.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: Brown's vision was dealt a serious setback during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Beyond Meat's stock price took a big hit."", 'ETHAN BROWN: We expected it to be pushed back, but just seeing it happen and being on the receiving end of it has been eye-opening.', 'BRIAN SOZZI: Despite everything that has gone on with the company, how have you stayed centered?', ""ETHAN BROWN: I appreciate that question. One, I have a great core team of people around me. We're trying to do something that is not going to happen overnight, that has fits and starts. We're going to make this thing into the long-term success that we've been after. I would be dishonest if I said, it hasn't been difficult. There have been challenges. But there's been more reward than there have been challenges. There's been more opportunity to impact change than not. And if you look at this from a historical perspective, you should expect this."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Why is it so hard to change consumer mindsets?', ""ETHAN BROWN: I think this is something that unlike, let's say, shifting from the fax machine to digital communication, to the landline, to the mobile phone, we're not trying to change something that has just been around for a couple hundred years."", ""Now, the way to think about it in my mind, though, is to not change it. Is to simply change the material, right? So provide the consumer with that delicious whole muscle steak, provide the consumer with the burger, provide the consumer with sausage, and it's just a different source of the protein. That's it."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: How have you dealt with some of those challenges from your perspective as a leader, not just as a CEO, as the founder?', ""ETHAN BROWN: I think it gets back to who you surround yourself with. And whether it's my team here or my board. My board has been incredibly supportive of this effort. They have a-- they're seasoned enough to have a long-term view."", ""I think the other piece is organizationally, I've gotten to really embrace the horizontal flow of value through an organization. If you think about the way we've set up businesses and we think of organizations in general, is always vertical. We've got the sales, marketing, operations, finance team, et cetera."", ""But that's not the way value flows. The value flows from product ideation all the way through to the consumer. So it's really horizontal. And so from a leadership perspective, it's really how do you teach people to think about the team as one single team and not as a department. This is really the lean style of management. And it's the lean management principles. And that is really the right way to run a business."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: In 2021, Beyond Meat opened a sprawling 288,000 square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, California. The location is outfitted with a state of the art test kitchen that may foster the next big thing in plant-based food.', 'Eating this stuff looks really good. I watched it being cooked. It grills like steak.', ""ETHAN BROWN: I love this product, and it really starts with what were talking about earlier about at the farmer level. So this is made from fava beans, which are being grown in North Dakota. Fava beans fixed nitrogen back into the soil, so the farmer is able to use less fertilizer, which means they're able to make more money with each acre, right? So there's no animal in this entire process."", '[MUSIC PLAYING]', 'BRIAN SOZZI: Is your mindset still-- and I think we talked about this in the past-- to fail fast and fail often.', ""ETHAN BROWN: Absolutely. So our program, our innovation program-- the Beyond Meat rapid and relentless innovation program-- that's at the center, is that we're going to move more quickly than anybody else, and we're going to fail and recover more quickly, right?"", ""And I think one of the challenges, of particularly young people have, is they're being dealt perhaps their first failure, right? And so many of the people that work here are coming out of really great academic backgrounds. And so it takes them a moment to realize that not delivering on something is not the end of the world, as long as they get back up and fix, right?"", ""And so we have to figure out how to get people comfortable with quick iteration, quick failure, and then quick recovery. And so it's a big part of our culture."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: So, Ethan, as someone dealing with these big leadership challenges, tell us about your style. How do you rally the troops and how do you get out the message that you're trying to change a category that is well established? It's meat. You're going up against big meat."", ""ETHAN BROWN: Yeah. We talk about this every day. I mean, first and foremost, is the true north. And that's what most leaders will have the team focus on. And so if we stay true to that true north, which in our case is to provide a plant-based meat that is indistinguishable from animal protein, do that at a price that everyone can pay, you just keep repeating and envisioning that and helping the team to see that, you can get through almost anything."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: So, Ethan, you see this upstart industry-- lab-grown meat-- it's out there. It's taking form. As a founder and a leader who have a company that does it differently, does that change how you lead Beyond Meat?"", ""ETHAN BROWN: The moment you walk in this building, you should feel a sense of urgency. Whether or not it's in-vitro meats or some other technology, you know, you're always going to be acting with a sense of urgency. In fact, I have--"", 'BRIAN SOZZI: I wanted to ask you about that. It says, ""Somewhere, someone is working harder on your idea than you are."" Does that still power you today?', ""ETHAN BROWN: It just summed it up for me. Because whether you're an athlete or a professional, there's always somebody that's working really hard. And so you just have that competitive mindset, that if it doesn't motivate you enough to just bring this goodness to the world, you know, competition can also motivate you."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Is it tough to turn it off?', ""ETHAN BROWN: Yeah. When your work is your mission, it's almost impossible."", '[AUDIO LOGO]']"

That is evident from the successful execution of various nodes like\xa0Intel 7 and Intel 4 and upcoming nodes like Intel 3, Intel 20A and Intel 18A. These nodes represent different levels of technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing. The smaller nodes indicate higher transistor density and improved performance.', 'Additionally, there are deployments of nearly\xa0150\xa0million units using Intel 7. These deployments include Alder Lake, Raptor Lake and Sapphire Rapids in Q3 2023. That magnitude highlights Intel’s ability to produce and distribute products in large quantities using advanced nodes. Also, initial shipments of Meteor Lake on Intel 4 have commenced, indicating Intel’s aggressive approach to ramping up production using state-of-the-art technology.', 'At its core, the utilization of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) tools for Intel 4 provides Intel with a competitive advantage in terms of capital efficiency compared to earlier EUV tool launches.

Does it all add to make the stock a buy? Here's the lowdown."", ""When determining what kind of yearly return you might get from a stock, it's usually a good idea to picture a snapshot of how it will look to other investors this time next year. Based on Wall Street analysts, Lockheed Martin is an attractive stock to buy."", 'For example, Wall Street has Lockheed Martin generating $26.74 in earnings per share and almost $6.3 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in 2024. Based on the current price, it trades at 16.8 times the estimated 2024 earnings and 17.7 times the estimated FCF. They are reasonable, but not startlingly cheap, valuations for a mature large-cap industrial stock.', ""While the stock looks slightly undervalued, there's no guarantee it will hit these earnings or FCF targets. At the same time, Lockheed Martin could exceed the estimates. Defense stocks are usually a favorite among investors for their relatively stable outlook. Defense spending isn't dependent on the economy, and the U.S. government is about as reliable a customer as you can find."", ""That said, there's a more than an usual amount of uncertainty around Lockheed Martin in 2024."", 'There are ongoing defense budgets to consider. During the company\'s third-quarter earnings call in mid-October, CEO James Taiclet departed from his usual practice of commenting on 2024 because of ""the current status of the 2024 U.S. Defense budget, global geopolitical tensions, and the macroeconomic environment."" The excellent news, at least from Lockheed Martin\'s perspective, is the defense bill has now been signed into law, giving authority for $886 billion worth of spending.', ""It's a considerable figure; in fact, it's a record defense budget. Still, investors need to consider a few things. It's only a 3% increase on last year's budget, highlighting that defense is a low-single-digit growth industry. And note that this 3% growth comes at a period of heightened geopolitical tensions, which may subdue in the future."", ""Moreover, given that the U.S. defense spending is larger than the combined sum of the following 10 countries , and accounts for 12% of federal spending, it's hard to see how U.S. defense spending will ever break out of the low-single-digit growth ceiling."", ""As such, while Lockheed Martin's outlook for defense spending in 2024 is positive, it might not look so good going into 2025."", ""While companies like Lockheed Martin, RTX, and Boeing's defense business have grown backlogs in recent years, they have all had issues delivering on those backlogs. In addition, margins have been pressured. In both cases, it comes down to raw material cost inflation and supply chain and labor pressures over the past few years. It's been a particularly problematic issue on fixed-price programs signed in less inflationary times."", ""These supply chain issues will probably subside at some point, which could lead to future profit margin expansion. These issues have extended longer than expected in 2023, and RTX and Boeing missed profit expectations in their defense businesses. It's a watch item for both bulls and bears in 2024."", 'CFO Jesus ""Jay"" Malave has already told investors to expect the unexpected regarding profit margins at the company in 2024. As noted earlier, management didn\'t give formal guidance on 2024 in October. However, Malave said he expected Lockheed Martin\'s segment margins to be ""relatively flat year over year"" but anticipates ""variability caused by the timing of impacts from"" a classified missile program in its missiles and fire control segment.', 'He went on to say the program could provide ""25 to 50 basis points of headwind"" in 2024. For reference, Lockheed Martin\'s business segment margin was 11% in the first nine months of 2023, so a reduction of 0.25% to 0.5% from that figure is significant.', ""In addition, deliveries of its key F-35 airplane will fall short of initial expectations in 2023, with 97 expected compared to a prior expectation of 100-120. Management believes it's on track to hit a delivery rate of 156 a year by 2025. However, that will still depend on getting validation for its technology refresh on the F-35 in 2024, and the refresh is already a year behind schedule."", 'Lockheed Martin looks somewhat undervalued, provided it hits market expectations and the defense spending outlook for long-term growth of low-single-digit growth remains the same at the end of 2024. Unfortunately, there are enough question marks around next year to make these assumptions open to question.', 'As such, the stock probably needs to go lower, or some negative risks dissipate, before tempting most investors to buy in.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lockheed Martin wasn't one of them.

Companies don't have to pay dividends. That's why they are often among the first cuts when companies face financial trouble. Over a dozen companies have cut their payouts in 2023, including former dividend stalwarts Intel and VF Corp."", 'However, there are a lot of safe dividend stocks out there. Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI), Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX), and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) are three super-safe dividend stocks because they generate contractually secured cash flow and have strong financial profiles. That makes them great options for those seeking to fortify their dividend income in 2024 and beyond.', ""Kinder Morgan offers investors a hefty dividend that currently yields 6.3%. That puts it among the top 5% highest yields in the S&P 500, where the average is 1.5%. While a high dividend yield is often a warning sign that a cut could be forthcoming, that's not a risk facing Kinder Morgan's payout."", ""The natural gas pipeline giant generates incredibly stable cash flow. It gets 61% of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts (meaning it gets paid even if customers don't use their contracted capacity) while hedging contracts lock in another 6% of its earnings."", ""Meanwhile, fee-based contracts supply 26% of the company's earnings (while these contracts have volume risk, it's paid the same fee regardless of commodity prices). That leaves only 7% of its cash flow exposed to commodity price and volume risk. Kinder Morgan's highly contracted cash flows give it lots of visibility into its earnings. It expects to generate $5 billion, or $2.21 per share, of cash flow in 2024."", 'Kinder Morgan will pay out a little over 50% of its stable cash flow in dividends next year. That enables it to retain substantial cash to fund expansion projects while maintaining a strong balance sheet.', 'The company currently expects its leverage ratio to end next year at around 3.8 times, well below its long-term target of 4.5 times. That gives it tremendous financial flexibility to continue growing its business and dividend (Kinder Morgan expects to increase its payout by around 2% in 2024, its seventh straight year of dividend growth). With natural gas demand expected to continue rising through at least 2030, Kinder Morgan should have lots of fuel to continue increasing its dividend.', ""Equinix pays a decent dividend. At 2.1%, it's ahead of the S&P 500. More importantly, that above-average payout is rock-solid and should grow at a decent clip in the coming years."", 'The data center REIT generates very predictable cash flow backed by long-term leases with companies renting capacity in its data centers. Meanwhile, it pays a conservative portion of that cash in dividends (45% for 2023). That allows it to retain lots of money to fund new investments while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. Equinix has the strongest financial profile among data infrastructure REITs.', 'That gives it the funding capacity to invest in expanding its data center platform. The company plans to invest $3 billion annually through 2027 on maintaining and expanding its data center portfolio. Equinix estimates that those growth-related investments will help support 8% to 10% annual revenue growth through 2027. That should power dividend growth of more than 10% annually. The REIT has already boosted its payout twice this year (10% in February and 25% in October).', ""Lockheed Martin's dividend currently yields 2.8%. The aerospace and defense company has increased its payout for 21 straight years."", ""The company generates lots of steady cash flow, expecting to produce around $8.2 billion in cash this year and $6.2 billion in free cash after funding capital expenses to sustain and grow its business. Lockheed aims to return all that cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given its A-rated balance sheet, the company doesn't need to retain that cash."", 'The defense contractor expects its cash flow to grow in 2024 and beyond. Given its massive backlog of defense contracts ($156 billion at the end of the third quarter), it has lots of visibility into its cash flow. Meanwhile, that backlog should continue increasing, with defense spending rising due to wars in Ukraine and Israel.', ""In addition, the company sees its 21st Century Security Solutions strategy driving incremental growth. That strategy is already paying off. Lockheed recently won a transformational award for an integrated air and missile defense program from the Australian Defense Force. The company's growing cash flow will enable it to buy back more shares and increase its dividend."", 'Kinder Morgan, Equinix, and Lockheed Martin pay safe dividends and earn contractually secured revenue, enabling them to produce predictable cash flow. On top of that, they have very strong balance sheets. Those features make them some of the most bankable dividends for 2024 and beyond.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kinder Morgan right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kinder Morgan, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Kinder Morgan wasn't one of them.

That may be the key question heading into 2024. Retail spending has been stout since the middle of the year, all while pundits have poked holes in household balance sheet trends, including the excess savings figure across income cohorts. Still, holiday spending trends appear generally impressive, even as the consumer prefers experiences and services over goods that trend could be slowly reversing.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with NKE.', 'Following a weak outlook, I see some risks in shares of Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE). The valuation appears fair to me at current levels, while the technicals are lukewarm at best as 2024 approaches.', 'According to Bank of America Global Research, Nike is among the leading athletic footwear and apparel companies in the world. It designs, develops, markets and sells its products across international markets. With about 40% of global market share in the footwear market, the company commands a heavy presence with its Jordan brand, Converse line and Nike golf shoes, among other athletic apparel. It produces and distributes through independent contracts while sourcing abroad.', 'Sporting a $164 billion market cap, the Oregon-based apparel and footwear company within the consumer discretionary sector trades at a high 29.8 forward price-earnings ratio and pays a modest 1.4% dividend yield as of Dec. 22. Following a disappointing second-quarter earnings report, shares trade with a low implied volatility percentage of 21%, while short interest on the stock is low at just 1.3%.', ""Earlier this month, Nike issued a mixed second-quarter report, but it was some of its internal numbers that resulted in a very poor stock price reaction. Second-quarter GAAP earnings of $1.03 per share topped the Wall Street consensus estimate of 85 cents, while revenue of $13.4 billion, up just 0.5% compared with year-ago levels, missed by $40 million. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the quarter declined 1% year over year. The results themselves were not all that bad, but it was the company's second-half outlook that drew concerns among investors. Having just completed its second quarter, all eyes were on the guide for the balance of fiscal 2024."", ""The management team lowered its outlook for the year due to weakness in China and emerging markets writ large. Its digital channels, key for future sales growth, were also cited for weakness and had its growth forecast slashed. What should have assuaged some shareholder concerns was the good news that the company was undertaking a cost-cutting initiative and reported margins that were actually quite healthy Nike's earnings beat was largely the result of a margin beat, while selling, general and administrative costs were in check. The company now sees $3.48 of 2024 operating earnings per share, reflecting a third quarter restructuring charge."", 'The goal is to accumulate $2 billion in cost savings over the next three years, with that potential cash flow being reinvested in growth opportunities. Something to watch for will be how the China market unfolds in the coming quarters sales from that geographic segment rose 8%, below the 10%-plus forecast. With growth under pressure, the high-20s earnings multiple appears rich.', ""Compared to its peers, Nike has a premium valuation with above-average growth prospects. Still, it is among the most profitable athletic footwear and apparel companies in the world and earnings per share revisions have been decent as of late, with a soft quarterly report notwithstanding. Finally, share price momentum has turned weaker compared with its retail peers. Key risks for Nike include adverse growth shifts in China, weakness in the company's direct-to-consumer business and unfavorably currency changes."", 'On valuation, analysts at Bank of America see earnings rising nearly 8% this year with strong earnings per share growth expected in 2024 and 2025. The current consensus forecast calls for normalized earnings per share growth of around 15% over the next three fiscal years, while the top line advances at a single-digit pace. Dividends, meanwhile, are expected to rise very steadily as the company focuses on cutting costs and reinvesting capital. With a forward enterprise value/Ebitda multiple of 23, prospective shareholders must still pay a significant valuation premium compared to the broad market and consumer discretionary industry. Nike remains solidly free cash flow positive, though, with $2.89 of free cash flow per share over the last 12 months.', 'If we assume $4 of operating earnings per share over the next four quarters and apply a price-earnings multiple of 26, then shares should be between $100 and $110. If we assume the consensus earnings per share growth rate going forward, near 15%, and a sector-median PEG ratio of 1.6, then that valuation appears fair to me. Thus, I see the stock near fair value today amid what appears to be both rising macro and company-specific issues heading into the 2024 calendar year.', 'Source: BofA Global Research', 'Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show an unconfirmed third-quarter 2024 earnings date of Thursday, March 21. A quarterly dividend of 37 cents will be paid on Tuesday, Jan. 2. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar.', 'An important pattern is emerging in the chart of Nike. Notice in the graph below that a series of lower highs has been established while prices on pullbacks may be consolidating after hitting a low in October 2022. Shareholders and those looking to enter the stock should wait for either a bullish breakout or a decent risk-reward level at which to buy on a further decline. As it stands, support is near $95 and that is a key spot because there is an old earnings-related price gap right near that level ($89), so scooping up shares on a retest under $100 could make sense.', ""On the upside, a rally through $125 to $130 would help confirm the bulls have overtaken the reins from the bears. Still, considering that Nike's long-term 200-day moving average is flat in its slope, there is no clear trend right now. The short-term 50-day moving average may be about to cross above the 200-day moving average in a bullish golden cross feature, but that could be short-lived following the stock's second-worst single-day move since 2008. That major down day took all the steam out of the relative strength index momentum oscillator (at the bottom of the graph). Finally, there is a high amount of volume by price starting at around $95, so we could be in a trading range for a bit here as the bulls and bears continue to battle it out."", 'Overall, buying on a pullback into the low-mid $90s appears as a better risk-reward strategy today while momentum traders could wait for a breakout above the noted resistance levels.', 'Nike continues to face challenges at the economy-wide level as well with its own operations, it appears. While gross margins were healthy, issues out of China, among other challenges, led the management team to focus on cost-saving plans rather than going for growth in 2024. The valuation appears fair while the technicals are mixed heading into next year.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

This alliance focuses on developing a plan complementary to Nike’s direct-to-consumer strategy. Additionally, it is focused on expanding its footprint at WSS, the company’s off-mall banner. International expansion is another catalyst.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Foot Locker’s digital business has been performing well for a while now. The company has been investing significantly to reinforce its digital presence and augment its direct-to-consumer operations. The company has activated a Shop Your Store feature on its website. Moreover, it has added Apple Pay and Google Pay to its digital payment options to provide greater flexibility and convenience to customers. During third quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s digital sales penetration rate was 17%, up 150 basis points year over year, excluding East Bay, which closed last year.Concerning cost-saving efforts, management had unveiled a $200 million cost-saving program opportunity. It expects to capture roughly 40% of the overall $350 million targeted savings this year. The company’s cost optimization program generated total savings of about $30 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.Additionally, the company is progressing well with the membership program FLX, which inspires customers to remain within the Foot Locker portfolio of banners. The FLX program continues to exhibit momentum and helps the company efficiently serve customers. Management remains encouraged to continue refining FLX globally.

Only about a dozen or so names clearly in the red over the past week. But I'm going to go through a couple of them. Starting it off with Moderna. This name getting pummeled this year. It's actually the second biggest laggard in the S&P year-to-date not being able to hold on to those gains during the COVID-19 pandemic. And how could they? How could they hold on to the growth that they got following the creation of that vaccine?"", ""They're going to be looking to some other potential growth areas heading into 2024. The street has not necessarily rewarded them for their investment in cancer research, cancer drugs, but they are looking to get regulatory approval in the US and Europe for respiratory virus vaccine. That could be a boon for this name moving forward. And that's why we could see some potential upside to this name heading into the new year. But watching that regulatory approval is going to be the thing to look at for investors."", ""I also want to talk about Nike guys. This name really struggling in earnings over the course of this year. And this latest earnings report was no different for this name. That forward guidance is the thing that investors were looking for. And they did not hear what they needed to hear, particularly when you look at sales, especially in China. And this is the thing that we've been talking about so much. When are we going to see recovery in China?"", 'Now, some of my sources, including Jay Hadfield who we recently had on our program said that the growth story in China is there because the situation is so dire.

Not so much today.', ""But they have gone up over the past four trading days, hitting above that Bollinger Band, though, twice, which could indicate that there's a little bit of overbuying in this name.

That's one potential explanation for some of the upside movement we're seeing here."", ""Also, we'll have to watch what they do with boots heading into 2024.

The company operates across three main business categories: Footwear, Apparel and Equipment.', ""In 2023, the Footwear segment was the most significant revenue contributor, generating $35.3 billion, which accounted for 68.9% of Nike's total revenue. The Apparel segment followed, bringing in $13.9 billion in sales and representing 27.2% of the total revenue. Meanwhile, the Equipment segment, though smaller, contributed $1.8 billion, amounting to 3.4% of the total revenue for the year."", ""In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Nike's revenue increased marginally by 1% to $13.4 billion. However, when adjusted for currency fluctuations, it decreased by 1%. This revenue figure fell slightly short of analysts' expectations of $13.43 billion. The most promising regions for the company's sales growth were Asia, Latin America and China. During the quarter, China experienced a sales growth of 4%, while the ALAP region saw a significant jump of 13%. Despite these gains, North America, traditionally the largest market, faced a 4% decline in sales."", ""Nonetheless, Nike's net income showed a robust increase. It surged by 19% to reach $1.6 billion, and the diluted earnings per share saw an impressive growth of 21% to $1.03. This higher earnings per share can be attributed mainly to a lower cost of goods sold, reduced income tax expenses and a decreased share count."", ""Over the past decade, Nike has consistently achieved both revenue and operating income growth. The company's revenue climbed from $25.3 billion in 2013 to $51.2 billion in 2023. Similarly, its operating income increased, rising from $3.24 billion to $5.9 billion over the same period. However, there was a contraction in both revenue and operating income in 2020. This downturn, triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, led to a 4.4% decrease in revenue and a significant drop of nearly 35% in operating income."", 'In the decade between 2013 and 2023, Nike demonstrated a generally upward trend in its operating and free cash flow, albeit with some fluctuations. The operating cash flow grew from $3 billion to $5 billion, achieving an annual compounded growth rate of 5.24%. Similarly, free cash flow also increased, rising from $2.43 billion to $4.87 billion. This represents compounded annual growth of 7.2%.', ""Nike has grown its revenue, profitability and cash flow, and it has also done so with remarkable efficiency, consistently achieving a high return on invested capital over time. Over the past decade, the company's ROIC, despite some fluctuations, has remained within a range of 15% to 33.35%. In 2023, it settled at 23%."", ""Nike's solid balance sheet offers reassurance to shareholders, demonstrating the company's financial stability. As of November, the company reported shareholders' equity of approximately $14.15 billion, which includes $7.92 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $2 billion in short-term investments. These short-term investments are highly liquid, with maturities of more than three months.

With its operating cash flow growing to $5 billion, Nike can comfortably meet its interest and principal payments.', ""Source: Nike's 10-K"", ""For the full year of 2024, Nike's revenue is projected to be approximately $52.2 billion. However, considering the company's management recently anticipated a softer revenue outlook for the second half, let's consider a 10% reduction in this forecast, bringing the expected revenue down to $47 billion. With Nike's average 10-year Ebitda margin standing at 15%, this revised revenue estimate suggests an Ebitda of around $7 billion. Applying a five-year average Ebitda multiple of 30 to this figure, Nike's enterprise value would be estimated at $210 billion. This represents a 26% increase over its current valuation."", ""Despite the recent turbulence in its share price, Nike's overall financial and operational health remains robust. The company's consistent growth in revenue, operating income, operating cash flow and free cash flow over the past decade underscores its resilience and strategic acumen. Nike presents a stable investment opportunity with a solid balance sheet, a low debt-to-equity ratio and efficient long-term debt management. The company's adaptability in navigating market changes and its strong foothold in key global markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America, are promising signs for future growth. Looking ahead to 2024, even with a conservative revenue estimate, Nike's projected enterprise value indicates a decent potential for appreciation."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

While Ozempic maker\xa0Novo Nordisk dominates medications designed to treat obesity and diabetes, two other companies are looking to get their slice of the pie -- but only one is succeeding.', ""Let's break down some alternatives to Novo Nordisk, and assess why one competitor looks like a great buy in 2024 while the other appears too risky."", ""Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) manufactures a diabetes treatment called Mounjaro. Chances are you've seen the commercials for the drug or may even know people who are prescribed it. Although Mounjaro has only been commercially available since mid-2022, demand for this medication is off the charts. Mounjaro generated $3 billion in revenue through the first nine months of 2023, making it Eli Lilly's second-largest top-line contributor."", ""And just last month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Mounjaro's sister product, Zepbound. While Mounjaro is used to treat diabetes, Zepbound's focal area is obesity. This is a major development for Eli Lilly as the company faces a fierce contest with Novo Nordisk."", ""By some estimates, the market for weight-loss medications could reach $200 billion by 2030. Although it's probably too early to know whether these forecasts are accurate, the main takeaway is that the demand for products like Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, or Mounjaro don't seem to be going away. Now, with the approval of Zepbound, Eli Lilly is well-positioned to acquire additional market share in the growing diabetes and obesity markets."", ""The thing investors should keep in mind is that Eli Lilly's stock has rocketed 56% in 2023 thanks to its all-around successful portfolio. As of now, Eli Lilly stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 87 -- roughly quadruple that of the S&P 500. It's clear that the capital markets are placing a premium on Eli Lilly and are bullish on the company's growth prospects."", ""But when thinking about the long term, investors should consider that Eli Lilly has yet to really benefit from Zepbound. Right now, the company's sales related to weight-loss medications stem from Mounjaro and Jardiance. The approval of Zepbound for obesity adds an entirely new layer of opportunity for Eli Lilly and should not go overlooked. Although the stock isn't exactly cheap, I would caution investors about trying to time the perfect opportunity to open a position."", ""I see Eli Lilly as much more than a developer of weight-loss medications given the depth of the company's portfolio in addition to weight-loss products. The drugmaker also has treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases, with both of these areas contributing billions in revenue. The company's cancer drug Verzenio grew 62% through the first nine months of 2023, but an expanded indication approval from the FDA could imply that its long-term prospects could be far more robust."", ""To me, Eli Lilly represents a compelling opportunity in the pharmaceutical industry in general. With its long-term returns in excess of 1,000%, patient investors have been handsomely rewarded by owning this stock, and I don't see that changing."", ""Another pharmaceutical company that's looking to participate in the race among weight-loss treatments is Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)."", ""While the company's vaccine played a monumental role combating COVID-19, its pursuit of the diabetes and obesity markets isn't looking too good. Although Pfizer still has some opportunities in its weight-loss pipeline, I wouldn't hold my breath. The company is far behind Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and even if it makes some inroads eventually, I think it'll be too little, too late."", ""Don't get me wrong. Pfizer has a large portfolio of medications, and its waning aspirations toward the weight-loss market isn't catastrophic. However, investors should keep in mind that its treatments for COVID-19 are not necessarily a catalyst anymore."", ""And as Pfizer enters the closing stages of its Seagen acquisition, I surmise that a significant amount of transaction costs will take a toll on the company's earnings growth. The markets are clearly accounting for the company's dwindling prospects given that shares of Pfizer stock are trading near their lowest point in a decade."", 'Moreover, with free cash flow generation both unpredictable and much lower than historical levels, Pfizer may face liquidity constraints as it integrates Seagen next year. While this is purely speculation, the company may be forced to seek further cost-saving efforts, which could come in the form of slashing its dividend.', ""I think there are simply too many risks associated with an investment in Pfizer right now, and I don't view its current price action as an opportunity to buy the dip. Unless Pfizer can prove that it's on a more respectable path for revenue and profit growth, I'd leave the stock alone and seek better opportunities."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Eli Lilly wasn't one of them.

What rate will the company have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 129%, which is rather optimistic!

NASDAQ 100 missed that record just by a hair. But it's impressive to see how all of these have stacked up and come to record highs throughout the year. And up first was the tech sector. And what's really interesting is that tech and homebuilders went neck and neck. The mag seven, for all of what we talked about them were met with several homebuilders stocks, and I'll show you that in a second, that were just going up with them into July. Then there was a period of recess, and then they ended up exploding in November, December and that's what we're looking at now."", ""But we're also seeing chip stocks that stocks at a record high 67% for the year. Covered homebuilders and tech want to talk about infrastructure. We got Pave, that's up 37%, or 30.7%. European financials, the Dow, you look at defense and aerospace, that's the ITA, ETF. Gold, we were just talking about that reaching a record the other day. And also insurance, although this peaked a couple of weeks ago."", ""So these are all record highs within the month of December. And these are individual stocks. This covers everything in the S&P 500, the NASDAQ 100, and meme stocks. So it's not completely representative of all US stocks, but it's pretty close. What's really interesting, I was talking about the homebuilders. Here, here's builder. This is highly levered to the building sector, and we can see this is a stock that rose through July, had a little bit of a comeback there to the downside, and then really went off to the races starting in November."", ""That's very similar to this chart of Apple. I'm just going to show you the market cap weighted view here. Very, very similar charts. Apple didn't quite surge as much as some of the others as part of the year end sprint here, but definitely worth writing home about, up almost 50%.

We got Lennar, another home builder up 65%."", ""What's been interesting too is to see some of these smaller or these less, these smaller return stocks really finally come into their records towards the end of the year. Here's General Dynamics. It's only up 4% for the year, and you can see it spent almost the entire year in the red, but it is finally climbed back here.

I will say, however, we are still in the midst of the Santa Claus rally. If we do manage these last five trading days of the old year and the first two of the new year, if we manage to close green, that's somewhat predictive of a year end close in 2024.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.', 'While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.', ' See our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Operations & Technology, Vivek Jain, for US$3.1m worth of shares, at about US$184 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$200). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was 75% of Vivek Jain's stake."", ""Analog Devices insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap."", ""Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Analog Devices insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$351m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders."", ""An insider sold Analog Devices shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Analog Devices is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales.

Most millionaires are self-made and through smart financial moves they reach the million-dollar mark. The emergence of the e-commerce market and digital infrastructure has paved the way for young enthusiasts to become millionaires and take their businesses and ideas global. According to the Global Wealth Report 2023 by Credit Suisse, there were an estimated 59.4 million millionaires in the world by the end of 2022. With an overall decline in global wealth, the number of millionaires worldwide fell by 3.5 million in 2022. A major reason for the downfall in the total number of millionaires was high inflation in 2022. In the next five years, global wealth is projected to grow by 38%, reaching $629 trillion by 2027. During the same period, the number of millionaires is expected to reach 86 million, while the number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) is likely to rise to 372,000 individuals.

The overall wealth gains are purely a phenomenon of the top 1% and top 10% wealthy people. The median wealth has increased more than the average wealth between 2019 and 2022, by 37%. That means wealth inequality did improve and narrowed in the last couple of years. There are almost 16 million American families with a wealth of more than $1 million, as of 2022. Approximately 8 million families are multimillionaires, whose accumulated wealth exceeds $2 million. New York City, The Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston are the top US cities with the most millionaires in the world.

While, around 21% of millionaires estimate the markets to remain relatively flat due to uncertain economic conditions such as government dysfunction, high inflation, and increasing national debt. For 2024, around 30% of millionaires are bearish on the economy and 28% expect the economy to remain similar to 2023. The majority of 42% of millionaires expect the economy to be weaker in 2024. Millionaire investors who own 85% of individually held stocks are not positioned for a rally and they are on the defensive side, holding the majority of their cash. The millionaire sentiment regarding the Fed cutting rates in 2024 isn’t strong. Almost 40% of millionaires expect the Fed to cut rates during the second quarter of 2024, while 34% of millionaires expect the Fed to cut rates by or after 2025.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

The good news is that it is likely to sustain its terrific momentum in the new year as well.', ""However, the downside to Nvidia's surge is that it now carries a rich valuation. And given that it trades at 27 times sales and 64 times trailing earnings, value investors will likely be looking for alternative ways to capitalize on the AI boom. This is where Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) comes in."", ""Shares of Marvell are up by 62% in 2023, which may seem a bit surprising at first given the chipmaker's tepid financial performances in recent quarters, when it faced headwinds due to weak spending by its data center and enterprise business customers."", ""But a closer look at Marvell's business reveals signs that its fortunes are set to turn around, and that AI will play an important role in driving improvements in its financial performance."", ""Marvell released its fiscal 2024 third-quarter results on Nov. 30. For the period, which ended Oct. 28, revenues fell nearly 8% year over year to $1.42 billion, while non-GAAP earnings were down 28% to $0.41 per share.

The silver lining, however, is that Marvell's guidance for the current quarter suggests that it is on the verge of a turnaround. The company's expects its revenue and earnings will be flat on a year-over-year basis in fiscal Q4. More importantly, analysts are expecting Marvell to return to growth in the next fiscal year, which will begin in February."", ""The company's cloud business, which is benefiting from the growing adoption of its AI offerings, is likely to play a central role in this growth."", ""According to Murphy, the company's AI business is growing at a faster-than-expected pace. As he remarked on the latest earnings call:"", 'In our last earnings call, we provided a forecast for AI revenue to cross a $200 million quarterly run rate exiting this year. Since then, demand has continued to grow, and we now expect our AI revenue in the fourth quarter to come in significantly above our forecast.', 'In other words, Marvell\'s AI-related business is on track to generate more than $800 million in revenue on an annual basis in the next fiscal year. Murphy\'s estimate that he expects AI revenue to be ""significantly above"" management\'s quarterly revenue run rate of $200 million indicates that this business could clock even $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, based on a $250 million quarterly run rate.', ""If that's indeed the case, AI could account for a sixth of Marvell's top line in the next fiscal year based on its $6.1 billion revenue forecast.

As such, Marvell\'s AI business seems set for long-term growth, which is why investors would do well to buy the stock before it heads higher.', ""Marvell Technology stock trades at 9.4 times sales, which is significantly cheaper than Nvidia. Additionally, Marvell's forward earnings multiple of 38 is lower than Nvidia's multiple of 55.

That would represent a 26% gain from current levels.

But the shortage of AI chips won't last forever as competitors race to bring alternatives to market, and neither will the gold rush mentality surrounding AI. Nvidia's software advantage will be chipped away, although that process may take a while."", ""Nvidia is valued at around $1.22 trillion.

For reference, it pays a base dividend of $0.20 and retains the flexibility to pay 50% of its excess free cash flow (which includes the base dividend) in the form of a variable dividend."", 'Since its earnings and cash flow are guided by its production and the price of energy, its overall dividend is also led by energy prices.', ""The question is: What kind of dividend yield can investors expect at what price of oil?

More than one-third of adults living in the USA eat fast food every day, and 83% of American families feast on fast food at least once a week. In addition to the convenience it offers, fast food is also preferred due to its low cost. The fast food consumption by state varies to a great extent.

(NYSE:CMG), reported buying 877 shares at around $2,280 per share, with a total value of about $2 million. In contrast, Chief Operating Officer Scott Boatwright sold 1,300 shares for $3 million. Should investors follow Engles or Boatwright's moves? Let's take a closer look."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CMG.', 'The company owns and operates 3,129 Chipotle outlets across the U.S., 53 locations in other countries and five non-Chipotle restaurants. Its main food offerings include burritos, burrito bowls, quesadillas, tacos and salads.', ""Chipotle has demonstrated a rising trend in its revenue, achieving growth in nine out of the past 10 years. The exception was in 2016, when the company faced a decline in sales of 13.3%, dropping from $4.5 billion in 2015 to $3.9 billion, primarily due to incidents related to food-borne illnesses. This decline was also reflected in a 20.4% drop in comparable sales. However, over the last decade, Chipotle's revenue has increased from $3.2 billion in 2013 to $8.63 billion in 2022, resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of 10.43%."", 'A critical metric for assessing growth in the restaurant industry is comparable restaurant sales, which indicate organic growth from outlets that have been operational for at least a year. Many restaurant chains generate sales growth from two sources: the opening of new restaurants or sales increases in existing restaurants. I favor the latter as it represents organic and sustainable growth. Over the past five years, Chipotle has consistently demonstrated growth in comparable restaurant sales. Remarkably, even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company saw an increase of 1.8% in its comparable restaurant sales. Subsequently, the comparable restaurant sales growth came in at 19.3% and 8% in 2021 and 2022, respectively.', 'Along with the growing sales is the operating income growth. Although its operating income fluctuated widely, especially during the time of the food-borne illness incident, its operating income bounced back strongly afterward. The operating income was $539.5 million in 2013, dropping to $58.4 million in 2016 before growing to $1.18 billion in 2022. During the same period, its operating cash flow increased from $529 million to $1.92 billion, while the free cash flow also followed the same path, growing from $223 million to $844 million.', ""In the third quarter, Chipotle sustained its growth momentum with robust rise in sales and earnings. The company's sales surged by over 11%, reaching $2.5 billion, buoyed by a 5% increase in comparable restaurant sales. This growth was complemented by an improvement in the restaurant-level margin, which rose by 100 basis points to 26.3%. Additionally, there was a notable 19% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share, climbing to $11.36."", ""Looking forward, Chipotle is setting its sights on expansion, with plans to open approximately 285 to 315 new restaurants by 2024. This strategic move indicates the company's confidence in its growth trajectory and commitment to broadening its market presence."", ""Chipotle maintains a balance sheet free of debt despite the extensive operations of its restaurants. The company's liabilities are primarily confined to operating lease obligations, which amount to nearly $3.16 billion. Looking ahead to the 2023 to 2027 period, the average annual payments for these lease liabilities are projected to be between $383 million and $404 million. Given that Chipotle's operating cash flow exceeded $1 billion in 2022, the company can comfortably manage these lease payments."", ""Compared to its competitors, including Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) and Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), Chipotle stands out with the most premium valuation. Chipotle's enterprise value/Ebitda ratio is the highest at 35.2, significantly surpassing the Ebitda multiples of Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International. Yum Brands' valuation is measured at 19.3 times Ebitda, whereas Restaurant Brands International has the lowest valuation at nearly 18.7 times."", ""When considering the historical five-year average Ebitda multiple, Chipotle's valuation of nearly 39 remains substantially higher than Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands. The five-year average enterprise value/Ebitda rati for Restaurant Brands International is only 15.80, while Yum Brands' five-year average is 20.20."", ""By 2024, Chipotle is projected to generate approximately $11 billion in revenue. Its 10-year average Ebitda margin at 14% translates to an expected Ebitda of around $1.54 billion. If we apply Chipotle's five-year average Ebitda multiple of 39 to this figure, the calculated enterprise value for the company would be about $60 billion. This estimated valuation is nearly 9% lower than its current market valuation, indicating that Chipotle is overvalued at the moment."", ""While Chipotle Mexican Grill showcases a promising profile with its increasing revenue, strong cash flow and robust balance sheet, the current valuation suggests it is overvalued. Given this scenario, it would be prudent for investors to monitor the company. A strategic approach would be to wait for a market correction before initiating a long position, thereby capitalizing on the company's solid fundamentals while also ensuring a more favorable entry point in terms of valuation."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

The company priced its IPO at $25 a share, opened for trading at $46, and then surged to $65.75 by the close. The gain when that closing bell sounded: a tasty 163%.', 'From there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, with big deals with global restaurant chains such as Yum! Brands-owned KFC and Dunkin’ Donuts (YUM), expansion plans into the refrigerated food sections at Target (TGT) and retailers overseas, and efforts underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items.', 'By July 2019, shares of Beyond Meat hit a peak of $234.90 a share.', 'However, the COVID-19 pandemic hammered the restaurant industry, and its financial toll sent people back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat’s impressive momentum stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including at rival Impossible Foods.', 'Along the way, attacks from entrenched parties in the meat industry and media on the healthiness of plant-based items hurt Beyond Meat’s standing with consumers. By November 2022, with losses eating into cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its workforce.', 'Then in November of this year, Beyond Meat — which has cut prices to stimulate demand — said it would slash 19% of its non-production workforce after a softer-than-expected third quarter.', 'Third quarter sales fell 8.7% from the prior year to $75.3 million.

That's not huge on an absolute basis, but it is notably higher than industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) bellwether Prologis (NYSE: PLD), which is yielding 2.6%."", 'If you are a dividend investor looking for an industrial REIT, that yield advantage might have you leaning toward Stag. Here are three things you need to know before you buy it.', ""Investors looking at Prologis will likely find its portfolio highly attractive, given that the REIT owns assets in key transportation hubs across the globe. Then there's an industrial landlord like Rexford Industrial (NYSE: REXR), which owns a highly concentrated portfolio in prime markets in California (this REIT's yield is 2.7%)."", ""The common thread here is that these two prominent industrial REITs are focused on what might be called primary industrial markets. That's not what Stag does."", ""Stag explains that it is more geographically diversified, at least in the domestic market (it doesn't own foreign properties like Prologis). But what that really means is that the company owns a lot of properties in secondary markets. This isn't a bad thing."", 'Primary markets are highly competitive and often see the most construction. Secondary markets are the purview of smaller investors, often mom-and-pop owners with just a few properties. That gives Stag an advantage because, as a public REIT, it has easy access to capital via stock and debt sales. This helps it to make quick decisions and allows Stag to buy larger properties more easily.', 'In this way, Stag has a differentiated business model, but investors need to understand and believe in the approach here before buying the stock.', 'At the end of the third quarter of 2023, occupancy was 98%. So demand is strong for Stag\'s properties, which is a good thing and currently a feature of most industrial space. The supply chain distributions left behind from the coronavirus pandemic have resulted in companies looking to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. market, and left other companies looking to strengthen their supply chains via a larger domestic footprint. The growth of e-commerce has also increased demand, often for ""last-mile"" locations that are closer to customers.', 'The high demand for industrial space benefits more than just occupancy. In the third quarter, Stag Industrial was able to increase rents on expiring leases by a lofty 54%. Through the first nine months of 2023, that figure was a still impressive 42%.', ""So not only is occupancy high, but Stag has material pricing strength today. There are clear reasons to like the company's prospects, at least in the near term."", ""Stag owns a portfolio of around 560 properties. The average remaining lease term of the portfolio is roughly 4.5 years. The negative takeaway from this is that, in around five years' time, Stag will have worked through its lease portfolio, pushing tenants with expiring leases up to higher rates (or releasing assets to different tenants at market rates)."", ""That's a long time, but the truth is that the strong renewal market isn't new, so the outsized increases may not actually be as robust as the REIT moves to the end of that average lease term. In other words, the big rent bumps won't last forever, even though they are very pleasing to see right now and will likely continue for a bit longer."", ""But there's also the potential impact of a recession that investors need to consider. Normally, an economic downturn would depress demand and thus impact both occupancy and rent growth. That could bring a premature end to the strong results Stag is experiencing today."", ""There's no telling when a recession might come about, but there are concerns on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases could bring one about in the near term. That said, the REIT's core funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio was roughly 62% in the third quarter, so there's ample room for adversity before the dividend would be at risk."", ""Still, investors need to recognize that Stag's strong business performance can't be extended indefinitely into the future."", 'Stag Industrial is a differentiated industrial REIT, given its focus on secondary markets. It is performing well today and has a higher yield than bellwether industrial REITs like Prologis and Rexford, which will be attractive to income-focused investors looking at the industrial property market.', ""However, it is also important to remember that the good times can't go on forever, for company-specific reasons (rolling over leases to higher rates can only go on for so long) and market-wide risks (recessions happen, and they can be bad news for industrial REITs). As long as you go in with your eyes wide open to both the risks and rewards, Stag could be a good long-term addition to your portfolio."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Stag Industrial right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Stag Industrial, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Stag Industrial wasn't one of them.

But fundamentals have been declining. And there are questions about whether the company's margin expansion is sustainable or if it was just a result of a pandemic-induced boost."", ""UPS is in for a challenging 2024. Even so, it stands out as my top high-yield dividend stock to buy next year. Here's why."", ""The greatest challenge in valuing a stock like UPS is separating its lasting improvements from its cyclical performance. Looking at recent numbers, there's no denying that UPS benefited from a surge in consumer goods spending and package delivery demand from the pandemic. At least part of its outsize gains were a one-time windfall."", ""But for years now, UPS has been making meaningful improvements to its logistics, routes, and operations. It has also been expanding its engagement in healthcare, automotive, and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The proof is in the numbers. UPS' digital access program for SMBs, paired with its healthcare segment, are expected to earn $2.7 billion more in 2023 revenue than in 2021 even though overall revenue is expected to decline by over $5 billion."", ""That's a telling statistic that some of UPS' growth is more permanent and not simply a benefit of the cycle. And that its long-term investments are partially offsetting cyclical challenges."", 'The biggest mistake UPS investors are making is assuming that all of its post-pandemic growth was temporary and that the company will revert back to 2019 levels. In reality, the company has done an excellent job of using its outsize 2020 and 2021 gains to improve the foundation of its business and make it more resilient to cyclical downturns.', ""UPS has earned more net income in the first three quarters of 2023 than in 2019 or 2018. And that's even when considering the company has cut its full-year guidance as growth is decelerating faster than expected."", 'UPS generates the majority of its revenue from its U.S. domestic segment. But its operating profit distribution may surprise you. In the third quarter of 2022, UPS generated $24.1 billion in revenue (63.6% of which was from the U.S.) and $3.1 billion in operating profit -- 53.5% of which came from the U.S. In Q3 2023, UPS made $21.1 billion in revenue (64.9% from the U.S.) and just $1.34 billion in operating profit -- with just 42.5% of operating profit from the U.S.', ""The takeaway is that the U.S. domestic segment is a lower-margin business relative to the company's international business and usually its supply chain solutions segment, too. So make sure not to read too much into U.S. cyclical trends, particularly delivery volumes, since U.S. residential deliveries are the company's lowest-margin business."", 'On its third-quarter earnings call, UPS said it is on track to pay about $5.4 billion in dividends this year. For comparison, UPS paid $5.1 billion in 2022 dividends but just $3.4 billion in 2021 dividends. Ten years ago, in 2013, it paid $2.3 billion in dividends.', ""Even if UPS endures a period of low growth in the short term, the stock is now in a completely different category than in years past, given how high the dividend is. There's only so far the stock can go before the yield becomes too attractive to ignore for such a high-quality business."", 'Even now, UPS is up over 21% from its 52-week low. And yet, the stock still yields 4.1% -- which is higher than the risk-free 10-year Treasury rate of 3.9%.', ""For investors who are willing to take on a little bit of risk, investing in UPS stock for essentially the same yield as the risk-free rate, but with added exposure to the potential upside (and downside) of the stock market and economic growth, makes a ton of sense. After all, UPS benefits from long-term e-commerce trends. And the stock is dirt cheap at a mere 16.4 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Even if UPS' earnings decline in 2024, it would take a major disappointment for UPS to even come close to the S&P 500 P/E of 26.3."", 'Simply put, UPS is too good of a company with too cheap of a valuation and too high of a dividend yield to pass up.', 'There are a couple of key attributes to look for when searching for a quality cyclical company. The first is the ability to endure a downturn by supporting growth projects, operations, and dividends with cash while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Another quality to look for is where the company lands on the other side of the cycle.', 'Ideally, investors want to see something of a smoothed-out staircase -- with flat or slight declines during downturns followed by ""higher highs"" during the next growth cycle.', ""In the case of UPS, the company has what it takes to manage a downturn and achieve new heights when the cycle improves. CEO Carol Tomé has consistently emphasized the company's long-term investments on earnings calls, and that many of these investments may take a while to pan out but will ultimately benefit the company and its shareholders."", ""UPS stands out as the perfect dividend stock to own in 2024 because the dividend is a sizable incentive to hold the stock through periods of volatility, while there's also the chance the business rebounds faster than expected, and the market rewards patient investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?', 'Before you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and United Parcel Service wasn't one of them.

Outcomes of ablation with the FARAPULSE PFA System – a nonthermal treatment in which electric fields selectively ablate heart tissue – will be compared to outcomes following use of anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy, which is commonly prescribed for patients living with persistent AF.', 'Unlike paroxysmal AF, which describes symptoms that last for seven days or fewer, persistent AF is a sustained arrhythmia that lasts for more than a week1. Early treatment of persistent\xa0AF can reduce the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure, and may prevent the disease from becoming permanent. Patients are often treated with AADs as frontline therapy for heart rhythm maintenance, though some can experience adverse effects and limited efficacy. Cardiac ablation is a potential alternative interventional strategy for those living with persistent AF.', '""With nearly 40,000 patients treated to date in clinical and commercial settings, the FARAPULSE PFA System continues to demonstrate a promising safety and effectiveness profile, upon which this study seeks to build,"" said Dr. Brad Sutton, chief medical officer, AF Solutions, Boston Scientific. ""The AVANT GUARD trial is exciting in that it has the potential to change clinical practice by advancing the therapy to be utilized as an earlier treatment for persistent AF, which may lead to better long-term outcomes and establish the FARAPULSE PFA System as the preferred method for treating the disease.""', 'The randomized AVANT GUARD trial will enroll more than 500 patients diagnosed with persistent AF at up to 75 sites globally. Patients in the study will be randomized to undergo pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and left atrial posterior wall ablation using the FARAPULSE PFA System, or receive AAD treatment, and followed for three years. The trial will evaluate the outcomes of therapy provided with the FARAPULSE PFA System versus AADs, including device-or procedure-related adverse events, the rates of freedom from AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia, as well as AF burden – a measurement of the amount of AF an individual experiences.', 'All patients in the trial will also be inserted with the Boston Scientific LUX-Dx™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor. This device simplifies the monitoring process for patients by automatically capturing and transmitting arrhythmia episode data, and is designed to detect recurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and assess AF burden by providing continuous rhythm monitoring.', 'This week, the Cleveland Clinic enrolled the first patient in the AVANT GUARD trial, overseen by Dr. Oussama Wazni, vice chair of cardiovascular medicine and section head, Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacing, Cleveland Clinic, who is also serving as the lead investigator of the trial.', 'Earlier this year, clinical trial data presented demonstrated the FARAPULSE PFA System is noninferior to standard-of-care therapies for the treatment of paroxysmal AF, with superior efficiency, while additional real-world data from more than 17,000 patients demonstrated continued real-world safety, efficacy and efficiency of the system. Boston Scientific also completed enrollment in the first phase of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial in the third quarter of 2023, which is studying the system for the treatment of patients with drug refractory symptomatic persistent AF, and commenced enrollment in an extension arm of the study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of adjunctive use of the FARAPOINT™ PFA Catheter for cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablations, a procedure used to treat atrial flutter.', 'The company now anticipates U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the FARAPULSE PFA System in the first quarter of 2024.

With the global coffee market steaming toward an impressive valuation, these companies stand at the forefront, each with a distinct blend of strategies poised to capitalize on 2024's opportunities. From Dutch Bros' rapid expansion to Starbucks' enduring dominance and Keurig's innovative approach, let's examine how these stocks might just deliver a caffeine kick to your portfolio."", ""Dutch Bros is known for its rapid expansion and an unmistakable quirky vibe that resonates with its loyal customer base. The company's recent financials strongly support its growth story. A 33% jump in year-over-year revenue to $265 million and the addition of 39 new shops in the third quarter offer clear indicators that its aggressive expansion strategy is paying off."", ""Dutch Bros also focuses on creating community hubs where customers feel a sense of belonging, thereby driving repeat business. Innovative approaches, including the company's app and rewards program, further enhance customer experiences and drive loyalty, building on a strategy aimed at bolstering long-term profitability and market share."", ""Dutch Bros's high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk rating from Morningstar Sustainalytics points to potential concerns that the company must navigate as it grows. ESG ratings reveal how a company manages its ethical behavior, environmental sustainability, and internal systems, factors that can significantly influence a company's long-term success and stability."", 'Dutch Bros continues actively trying to bolster its brand reputation and operational efficiency. By strengthening community ties and focusing on customer engagement, along with behind-the-scenes financial maneuvers like upgrading credit facilities to ensure ample liquidity, Dutch Bros is gearing up to tackle these challenges head-on, even in the face of stiff competition.', 'Starbucks has long been a leader in the global coffee market, delivering innovative strategies and consistent performance. As the company expands its global footprint and enhances customer experiences through digital innovation, it builds a history of growth and resilience. With a focus on operational efficiencies and strategic market investments, particularly in lucrative regions like China, Starbucks continues brewing a potent mix of brand loyalty and international prowess.', ""Backing Starbucks is essentially investing in a harmonious mix of established reliability and progressive expansion. The latest financials showcase growth, with net revenues hitting an all-time high of $9.4 billion, marking 11% growth, alongside a notable 8% increase in global comparable-store sales. Starbucks' loyalty program and digital strategies act as dynamic catalysts, enhancing customer engagement and driving sales. The brand's noted tactical investments in streamlining operations and growing its global presence signify a roadmap to sustained growth and a commanding market presence."", ""However, market saturation and stiff competition present real challenges. Starbucks' innovative reinvention plan, focusing on operational efficiency and a tailored customer experience, showcases its proactive stance in staying ahead of the game. Its medium-risk ESG rating by Sustainalytics reflects a conscientious approach to environmental and governance issues, setting it apart from emerging competitors like Dutch Bros."", 'This forward-thinking and responsible strategy aligns with contemporary consumer values. Starbucks provides a compelling choice for those looking to invest in a company with a long-term vision.', ""Keurig Dr Pepper, renowned for its innovative coffee brewing systems and diverse beverage portfolio, continues brewing up a storm of disruption in the competitive food and beverage markets. The company's third-quarter financials reveal a robust 5.1% increase in net sales, hitting $3.8 billion, alongside a significant expansion in gross margin."", ""Strategic moves, like the foray into sports hydration through a partnership with Grupo PiSA for Electrolit and investments in burgeoning sectors like ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee, bolster these strong results and help build the company's future. These initiatives demonstrate Keurig Dr Pepper's proactive approach to capturing new market segments and reinforcing its presence in the beverage industry."", ""The company's strategic focus on diversifying its product offerings and enhancing operational efficiency taps into a proven recipe for sustained growth, one likely to prove critical in the face of stiff competition in the beverage market. Moreover, its medium ESG risk rating indicates a mindful approach to sustainability and governance, reflecting a commitment to responsible business practices that resonate with modern consumers and investors alike. As Keurig Dr Pepper continues to expand its horizons and refine its brew, the company stands poised to deliver a rich blend of returns and growth opportunities for investors."", ""Statista notes that the 2022 coffee-shop market was worth over $165 billion, and its analysis predicts continued compound annual growth above 4%. As 2024 percolates, Dutch Bros, Starbucks, and Keurig Dr Pepper all offer attractive options for investors looking to tap into the coffee market's potential."", 'Dutch Bros impresses with its rapid expansion and distinct culture, Starbucks continues to innovate and dominate globally, and Keurig diversifies its portfolio with strategic partnerships and new market ventures. Investors might find the vibrant coffee market suits their tastes very well next year. A tougher choice might be one favored by café regulars: deciding which coffee selection delivers the blend that best aligns with your investment palate.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dutch Bros wasn't one of them.

A stock price can tell you a lot, but it doesn't tell you everything."", ""Before committing your cash, it's important to look beyond recent share performance and at the underlying business you want to buy. With that in mind, here are two remarkable healthcare companies to consider now."", 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is trading up by about 42% over the trailing 12 months. The company is riding on the wave of multiple business successes, the most recent being the earliest slate of approvals for the first-ever gene-editing therapy to garner the regulatory green light. The therapy, called by its brand name of Casgevy (also known as exa-cel), was developed in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics.', 'Casgevy is being marketed as a potential one-time functional cure for two rare blood disorders: sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT). Under the terms of the deal, Vertex takes on 60% of the program costs and will garner 60% of the profits from Casgevy. Casgevy is expected to commercialize for $2.2 million a treatment.', ""The therapy has just been approved in the U.K. for qualifying patients with sickle cell disease and TDT aged 12 and up, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration just gave its seal of approval for the former indication in early December. The FDA's decision to indicate the drug for TDT is expected in early 2024. The European Commission's decision to approve Casgevy is also anticipated in the first quarter of next year."", 'Vertex cut its teeth on the rare disease drug market with a focus on disorders that have historically been underserved by the medical community at large. Its business, which produces billions in revenue and profits annually, currently revolves around a lineup of four products, which are the only drugs on the market that treat the rare genetic illness cystic fibrosis. The company is also working on therapies for other disease areas, including a non-opioid drug for acute pain and two stem cell therapies for diabetes.', ""This first wave of Casgevy approvals is initially expected to open up the therapy to close to 20,000 patients. However, just looking at the incidence of sickle cell disease, it's estimated that there are close to 100,000 individuals living with the disease in the U.S. alone and 20 million globally. In short, this could be the beginning of a new era of growth for Vertex's business, which is already coming from a position of strength."", 'Now looks like it could be a good time to scoop up some shares of this healthcare business before it rockets higher.', 'Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) has seen shares soar by about 66% over the past year. The platform has become a one-stop shop for travel enthusiasts with a range of needs and interests, from business travelers to leisure travelers to individuals capitalizing on the remote work revolution.', 'The proof is in the pudding. Airbnb brought in revenue of $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2022 alone, while profits totaled $4.4 billion for the three-month period. That revenue figure was up 18% from one year ago and 107% from four years ago.', 'The company also saw nights and experiences booked reach the 113 million mark, 14% higher than one year ago and 32% higher than in the same quarter in 2019. Airbnb is also proving to be a free-cash-flow machine: That figure totaled $4.2 billion in the trailing 12 months ending on Sept. 30.', ""The company's business model is inherently capital-light, because Airbnb doesn't actually own or operate the properties on its platform. Instead, it provides a two-sided travel solution to connect hosts around the world to guests looking for everything from a one-night stay to a months-long booking."", 'Not only can hosts generate primary or secondary streams of income on Airbnb, but guests can find the stay that best aligns with their travel needs and preferences. The concept is simple, but effective. Business continues to boom in the period following the pandemic era, as travelers are continuing to spend cash even as wallets are more tightly constrained than in past periods.

We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing."", 'Procter & Gamble already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Procter & Gamble, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.', ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Procter & Gamble is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.6%. With 6.5% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders."", ""Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder."", ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily."", 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.', 'Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.', 'Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Procter & Gamble Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$184m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

However, the situation appears to be improving lately as inflation continued to show signs of a steady decline and expectations of multiple rate cuts in 2024 heightened. The industrial sector put up a great fight against the odds as demand remained high.The easing of supply-chain disruptions amid a healthy demand environment has led to a slow but steady improvement in industrial production of late. Per the latest report published by the Federal Reserve, production at U.S. factories increased 0.2% month over month in November, and manufacturing output rose 0.3%. Also, capacity utilization inched up 0.1% point from the previous month’s level to 78.8% in November.As momentum in the U.S. economy continued, strength across several end-markets, including mining, aerospace, transportation equipment, appliances and components and electrical equipment are expected to drive the performance of industrial stocks. We believe that stocks like Eaton Corporation plc ETN, Axon Enterprise, Inc. AXON, A. O. Smith Corporation AOS, Kadant Inc. KAI and Alamo Group Inc. ALG are worth adding to your portfolio now.', 'Despite a sharp decline in inflation, activity in the manufacturing sector has not been impressive over the past few months. Per the Institute for Supply Management’s report, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) touched 46.7% in November, contracting for the 13th consecutive month. However, the manufacturing sector has been showing signs of gradual improvement.In November, the New Order Index increased 2.8 percentage points from the previous month’s level. The uptick in new orders, especially for durable goods, in conjunction with the improvement in supply chain, is expected to bolster manufacturing activity in 2024.Also, in the face of easing inflation and price pressures, the industrial sector is expected to gain as the Federal Reserve hinted at multiple rate hikes in 2024. The central bank is expected to go for at least three 25 basis point rate cuts next year, which will likely drive orders and bolster manufacturing activity.Lower interest rates will enable people to come out of their cautious spending pattern and allow them to spend more freely. Additionally, the reduction in raw material costs should aid the bottom line of industrial companies. Given this situation, investing in industrial stocks seems to be a prudent choice.', 'The below-mentioned stocks, having put up solid performances in 2023 so far, make for good investment options. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) each and have a market capitalization of more than $1 billion. Stocks with larger market capitalization can better withstand market downturns and hence are considered safer bets.

Improved supply-chain performance, efforts to improve efficiency and lower costs are likely to boost its margin.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALG’s 2024 earnings growth rate is pegged at 13.6%.

(NASDAQ:PEP) experienced a challenging 2023 as its share price declined nearly 8% over the past 12 months. This performance fell short of the S&P 500's 24% return over the same period. The lackluster progress of the shares could be attributed to the market concerns about GLP-1 and Ozempic weight loss drugs. These drugs might lead consumers to reduce their snack consumption, impacting PepsiCo's sales rather than reflecting the company's fundamentals."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with PEP.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', ""I believe PepsiCo's current share price is undervalued to its business potential."", ""PepsiCo is a leading corporation in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, manufacturing and distributing a wide range of convenient food and beverages. It serves consumers in over 200 countries and territories, boasting a portfolio of renowned brands, including Pepsi, Doritos, Lay's, Mountain Dew and SodaStream. The company is structured into eight operating segments, including Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which focuses on branded convenience businesses in the U.S. and Canada, and Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), known for its branded cereals, rice, pasta and other food products. The other segments are PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), Latin America (LatAm), Europe, Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA) and Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China (APAC)."", ""In 2022, the most significant revenue contributors were PBNA, generating $26.2 billion, which accounted for 30.3% of the total revenue, and FLNA, with $23.3 billion in revenue, representing 27% of the company's total sales. This segment breakdown highlights the diverse and global nature of PepsiCo's operations, underlining its status as a dominant player in the convenience food and beverage market."", ""Recenly, weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy have gained significant popularity. They function by delaying the transfer of food from the stomach to the small intestine, leading to a quicker and longer-lasting sensation of fullness in consumers. As a result, consumers would purchase less salty and fatty snacks. This shift in consumer behavior could potentially affect snack-producing companies, including PepsiCo. Nonetheless, the accessibility of these drugs to the broader population is restricted by their high cost, with Wegovy's annual price tag exceeding $16,000."", ""In a recent earnings call, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta noted the impact of these drugs on the company's business has been minimal so far. Moreover, it has been proactively diversifying its offerings into healthier food and beverage options, including zero-sugar Pepsi, Gatorade and Cytosport's protein bars. The company has set ambitious targets for its product portfolio: aiming for at least two-thirds of its beverage volume to contain 100 or fewer calories and 75% of its global foods portfolio volume to contain less than 1.3 milligrams of sodium per calorie and less than 1.1 grams of saturated fat per calorie. This strategic shift toward healthier options positions PepsiCo well in a global market that is increasingly health-conscious."", 'In the third quarter, PepsiCo reported a 7% increase in revenue, reaching $23.45 billion, while its operating margin saw notable growth of 20%, surpassing $4 billion. This improvement in operating margin, rising from 15.3% in the same quarter of the previous year to 17.1% this year, can be attributed to productivity savings and mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives. Indeed, the company has kept delivering growth and improvement in profitability.', ""At first glance, investors might express concerns regarding PepsiCo's substantial debt obligations recorded on the balance sheet. In the third quarter, the company's shareholders' equity stood at $18.8 billion, in contrast to a considerably higher long-term debt of nearly $35.84 billion and a short-term debt close to $9 billion. Consequently, the debt-to-equity ratio approached 2.4. However, it is important to note these long-term debt obligations, which feature low interest rates, have been extended to 2060."", ""Between 2023 and 2027, PepsiCo is scheduled to make principal payments ranging from $2.4 billion to $3.2 billion annually. Given the company's track record of generating an average annual operating cash flow exceeding $10 billion over the past decade, it is well-positioned to manage both interest and principal payments comfortably."", ""Source: PepsiCo's 10-K"", ""Additionally, the low shareholders' equity is primarily due to the company's extensive share repurchase program, which amounted to $40 billion as of September 2023. PepsiCo has consistently repurchased shares every year, reducing its share count from 1.56 billion in 2023 to approximately 1.39 billion at the time of writing."", ""Income investors are particularly fond of PepsiCo for its consistent dividend payments. Over the past decade, the company has increased its dividend per share from $2.24 in 2013 to $4.52 in 2022, achieving an annual compounded growth rate of approximately 7.3%. During this period, the cash flow from operations has more than sufficed to cover the dividend payments, representing 35% to 55% of the operating cash flow. Consequently, PepsiCo's robust operating cash flow is more than adequate to sustain annual dividend distributions to its shareholders. With the upcoming annual dividend per share of $5.06 in 2023, the annual dividend yield reaches 3%."", ""By 2024, PepsiCo is projected to generate approximately $96.5 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $8.16. Using its five-year average earnings multiple of 25.30, the company's share value is estimated at around $204, 21.5% higher than its current trading price."", ""Despite the challenges faced in 2023, PepsiCo's fundamental strength and strategic initiatives position it as a resilient and promising investment. The company's diverse global operations, proactive shift toward healthier products and consistent financial performance underline its capacity to adapt and thrive in a dynamic market. With a robust operating cash flow supporting its dividend payments and an estimated share value significantly higher than its current trading price, PepsiCo demonstrates potential for growth and value creation for its shareholders. Investors looking for long-term stability and growth in the fast-moving consumer goods sector would do well to consider PepsiCo as a key component of their investment portfolio."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"
