We disagree and believe that SCHW has ample short-term financing to shield them from having to realize any losses on their securities book.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Charles Schwab with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab How Fast Is Charles Schwab Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Charles Schwab grew its EPS by 14% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Charles Schwab's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. While we note Charles Schwab achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 15% to US$21b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.4b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!Is Charles Schwab Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Charles Schwab is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. If you think Charles Schwab might suit your style as an investor, you could go straight to its annual report, or you could first check our discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for the company.Although Charles Schwab certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

SICNX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSICNX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab International Core Equity made its debut in May of 2008, and since then, SICNX has accumulated about $507.38 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund is currently managed by Wei Li who has been in charge of the fund since June of 2013.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 0.93%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 8.1%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SICNX's standard deviation comes in at 17.27%, compared to the category average of 20.95%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 17.98% compared to the category average of 18.25%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsWith a 5-year beta of 0.86, the fund is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&amp;P 500. With a negative alpha of -7.82, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SICNX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.86% compared to the category average of 1.13%. From a cost perspective, SICNX is actually cheaper than its peers.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, even with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab International Core Equity ( SICNX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and therefore looks a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.Don't stop here for your research on Mutual Fund Equity Report funds.

8,28d5721b-cf3f-3f81-a32d-c004a7e9caef,NUE,2023-06-30,Nucor Corporation's (NYSE:NUE) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporations-nyse-nue-stock-110053086.html,1688122853,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor's (NYSE:NUE) stock is up by a considerable 23% over the past month. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Nucor's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nucor is:36% = US$7.1b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.36 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Nucor's Earnings Growth And 36% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Nucor has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, Nucor's exceptional 41% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.We then compared Nucor's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 31% in the same 5-year period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Nucor's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Nucor Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Nucor's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 9.8%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 90% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Moreover, Nucor is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 18% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 12%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Nucor's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

We developed Design Select to elevate our service for the specification community by making it easy for them to choose superior solutions with dependable service. Design Select consists of 3,000 configurable products that meet important specification needs from some of our core families of lighting and lighting control brands, including Aculux, Gotham, Lithonia Lighting, nLight and SensorSwitch. Design Select is an important addition to our service strategy. ABL Lighting and Lighting Control products are now organized into 3 clear categories: Contractor Select is 300 of the most important everyday lighting and lighting control products available in stock at retailers and electrical distributors; Design Select is 3,000 configurable products that meet the key choices of lighting specifiers with dependable service; and the remainder is made to order. Through the combination of high product vitality and improved service levels with the specification community, distributors and contractors, we continue to differentiate ourselves and challenge the existing industry standards. We also continued to introduce new products during the quarter. Our Luminis brand launched the in-line family of exterior luminaires for use in plazas and arenas. Each light module can rotate 355 degrees and can be individually controlled, allowing installers to position the Luminaire on site for improved flexibility to create optimal illumination solutions. The recognition of our product vitality efforts is important to our team and our customers. And this quarter, several of our products won prestigious Red Dot Design Awards, including products from Luminis and Eureka. The Eureka Tangram-Trace was awarded a Red Dot Best of the Best distinction for its groundbreaking design. Other winners in this category included products from Apple, IBM and Sonos, and span categories from VR headsets to first responder drugs. We're proud to be in this company of innovators. Now moving to our Intelligent Spaces Group. This was a big quarter for our spaces team both at Distech and at Atrius. First, on Distech. Our strategic priority is to expand our addressable market, which we are doing in 2 ways. The first is geographic, which continues to progress successfully. The second is by increasing what we control in a built space. During the quarter, we announced the completion of the acquisition KE2 Therm, which allows us to expand Distech's addressable market by entering the commercial refrigeration control space. By controlling commercial refrigeration, we are able to more effectively sell the entire Distech portfolio in verticals like retail, restaurants and schools.The timing is significant as the refrigeration industry responds to the need for ultra low global warming potential refrigerant technologies. This has led to growing demand for transcritical CO2 solutions, which require the precision of digital controls to provide safety, efficiency and reliability while delivering cost savings to the customer. I now want to spend a few minutes on Atrius. Our strategy with Atrius has been to build a data layer that connects the edge to the cloud and use that data to develop applications that make a difference in built spaces. Earlier this month, we showcased our products at the IBcon 2023 Conference in Las Vegas. This is the largest smart building conference for commercial real estate and facilities companies.At IBcon, we launched Atrius DataLab, a powerful data layer that supports a portfolio of Atrius applications that is foundational to our ability to automate the environment of a built space. Atrius Data Lab captures data from a building management system and organizes it in the cloud. From there, it harmonizes the data for accessibility and usefulness and creates a digital twin. Applications are built on top of that digital twin, allowing users to analyze historic scenarios, get live updates of the current building environment and model other scenarios.This service is important because every building is different. Our Atrius applications have been built to ensure that our partners achieve their specific energy and sustainability goals through the collection, measurement and management of data in each of their built spaces. Atrius Sustainability and Atrius Energy are live and were built on the foundation of Atrius Building Insights. Atrius Sustainability is an automation tool that captures, categorizes and reports on carbon emissions within built spaces. Atrius Energy facilitates the reduction of energy and carbon usage by allowing facilities teams to benchmark their usage against Science Based Targets. Later this year, our team will be rolling out Atrius Facilities and Atrius [Resolve]. Now looking to the remainder of fiscal 2023. Our third quarter played out as expected with sales being impacted by both lead time normalization and the macro environment. Entering our fourth quarter, we believe that there will be a continuation of these trends. While our order rates and our shipment rates are returning into closer alignment with each other, we have not yet returned to normal sequential seasonality. In ABL, we are going to focus on strategic pricing, continued productivity improvements and managing material costs. In ISG, we're going to focus on the continued growth of Distech and Atrius and the successful integration of KE2 Therm. We will continue to prioritize managing margin, generating strong cash flow and allocating capital effectively. Now I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will update you on our third quarter performance.Karen J. HolcomThank you, Neil, and good morning to everyone on the call. In the third quarter of 2023, we delivered sequential and year-over-year adjusted operating profit margin improvement despite a decline in net sales. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share and generated strong cash flow from operations. For total AYI, we generated net sales of $1 billion, which was 6% lower than the prior year as a result of the decline in net sales in our ABL business. As Neil described, this was the result of lower volumes, consistent with lead time normalization trends and the impact of the wider macro environment.As we made clear on our last call, our focus is on delivering margin and operating cash flow. During the quarter, both operating profit and adjusted operating profit were flat on lower sales. We expanded adjusted operating profit margin to 16.3%, which was an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the prior year and an improvement of 230 basis points sequentially, driven by the improvement in gross profit margin. During the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.75 increased $0.23 or 7% over the prior year.Moving to our segment performance review. ABL net sales were $941 million in the quarter. This decrease of 7% compared with the prior year was largely driven by declines in the independent sales network and lower OEM sales. This was partially offset by infrastructure projects in the direct sales network and continued strong performance in our retail channel. ABL's operating profit and adjusted operating profit were both flat on lower net sales, and we delivered adjusted operating profit margin of 17%, a 120 basis point improvement over the prior year and a 200 basis point improvement sequentially as price held and material input costs improved, particularly steel and inbound freight. The spaces segment continued to perform well with another good quarter. Sales were $66 million, an increase of 13% as both Distech and Atrius continued to grow. Spaces' operating profit was $9 million and adjusted operating profit was $13 million as we continued to invest in the business for longer-term growth. Now moving to our cash flow performance. We generated $472 million of cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of fiscal 2023, an increase of $306 million over the same period in 2022, driven largely by improvements in working capital. We have improved both days of inventory and accounts receivable compared to the end of the year. As we've discussed on prior calls, we've continued to bring inventory down by 22 inventory days from the peak in February 2022, and we've also brought inventory levels down by over $36 million sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Year-to-date, we invested $48 million in capital expenditures and allocated $219 million to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We have invested for growth in our current businesses through R&amp;D and CapEx. We've expanded our platform through acquisitions, as evidenced by the purchase of OPTOTRONIC in our lighting business and KE2 Therm in our spaces business. We've maintained our dividend, and we've created permanent shareholder value with approximately $1.2 billion share repurchases since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at an average price of approximately $142 per share, which was funded by organic cash flow.To summarize our performance for the quarter. We delivered strong margin and cash flow despite sales being down year-over-year. Based on year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now expect full year net sales to be between $3.9 billion and $4 billion. Our expectations for full year adjusted diluted earnings per share have not changed. Our focus continues to be on meeting the needs of our customers and delivering margin and cash flow. Thank you for joining us today. I will now pass you over to the operator to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.Timothy Ronald WojsMaybe just to start out on the market. I appreciate kind of the color around kind of order rates and shipment rates and kind of how those are normalizing. I was curious if there was any way to kind of break that out by the channel or segmentation, whether it's kind of the project business or what you're seeing on the stock and flow side and then maybe some of your more direct accounts?Neil M. AsheYes. Tim, so let me start from kind of back to front. So first, on the corporate accounts and on the OEM side, that's where those are obviously going to be volatile, and those are down and those order rates are relatively low. There's lots of reasons for those, the timing of renovations at our big customers on the corporate account side; and then second, on the OEM side, there's probably some continued destocking going down in the driver market. Then as you kind of get to our direct sales network and our project business, that's where the C&amp;I order rate is relatively stable at this point. So -- and our direct sales is also consistent. So they're finding a level here where they're relatively consistent. And then finally, we've had continued strong performance in retail. So when you blow it all back together, I think it's a continuation of the trends we've seen from this quarter and looking out to what we can see right in front of us.Timothy Ronald WojsOkay. And I guess, like as you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're not really quite back to normal revenue seasonality yet. I mean, is there any kind of expectation or thought when you might be back to that kind of normal seasonality?Neil M. AsheYes. We're not ready to call that yet, Tim, as we sort our way through this. I mean, we're looking at the same kind of windshield metrics that you are to try and understand. So because we haven't gone through a period that looks like this one, we don't have a perfect proxy for where that is. So we're, at this point, going to take it one quarter at a time.Timothy Ronald WojsOkay, okay. Makes sense. And then just the last one, and this is maybe more of a bigger picture question. Just with how you're bucketing sales with just under the Contractor Select, the Design Select and kind of the MTO products. I mean, I guess, could you talk about what's different with that segmentation versus before? And if you're aligning it this way, does that have more of a top line sales impact for you, just easier to order? Or is that more of a benefit to margins because maybe it eliminates a lot of, like cats and dogs on some of the products?Neil M. AsheYes. So I think the delineation -- the clarity of the delineation is powerful on a number of levels. First, as you know we've had a lot of success for Contractor Select. So building a product of 300 SKU product line that's built for stocking and resale and retail and electrical distribution provides us the ability to be very -- have very high product vitality, have very high service levels and be an important partner to the retail and electrical distribution industry, and it allows us to compete effectively with whoever wants to enter the market through that channel. So that's been a real success for us. Design Select is then about configurable products for the specification community. And what this allows them to do is choose -- basically make good choices among the product families. So this is the next step in that process. So our expectations aren't that this creates a new line of revenue, but it is -- our expectations are that we will create a lot more efficiency for them as well as for us. And then finally, we can isolate made to order. So when we isolate made to order, then we can treat it as such, which is made to order. And we can price it accordingly, we can -- and we can service it accordingly. So that's the import of creating those different buckets, is ultimately that we're trying to make the light and lighting control business more predictable, repeatable and scalable.OperatorOur next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.Joseph John O'DeaWanted to start on the margin front. Really strong gross margins during the quarter. I think just sort of if you could unpack a little bit on the price/cost dynamic. And maybe if we go back a couple of years, you were talking about a gross margin target of around 42%. It looks like you should be north of 43% this year. So how do we think about the sustainability of that? And then what you might be seeing on the price side, any sort of incoming pressure you're seeing there?Karen J. HolcomJoe, thanks for the question this morning. I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Neil to add on. So as we talked about on the call, at ABL, we're really focused on strategic pricing, continued productivity improvements and managing material costs. So again we've demonstrated discipline in all these areas this year, which is resulting in the strong gross margin that you see in the quarter, and that's going to continue to be our focus. And the other thing I would add is that we're having continued growth at ISG, and so that's helping us as well.Neil M. AsheYes. And I would only build on that a little bit, Karen. I think you summarized it well to say that, Joe, I think we have made an improvement from where we were when we were targeting the 42%. So clearly, we've improved the business since then. And I would just pick up on 2 things that Karen pointed out there. First, around strategic pricing, so that's where on the Contractor Select portfolio, we can compete with anyone that wants to enter the market through those channels, which is very effective. And we can choose which projects we want to participate in based on pricing. So we're significantly more strategic about how we're pricing. Second is that we're really working hard, and our teams have done a nice job on the combination of productivity improvements and material cost savings. That's a combination of our product vitality efforts and the work that we're doing in our supply chain to level load. And then finally, I'd emphasize that the continued growth of ISG is growth accretive, margin accretive and returns accretive.Joseph John O'DeaAnd then just a question related to outlook, both this year and next. I think this year, the earnings outlook, sounds like maintaining that but it's $1.50 range. And so any anything that you would talk to in terms of what's most likely within a narrowing of that band? And then as you think about a '24 guide in a few months, Neil, just what are sort of the most important watch items for you over the next few months to sort of inform how you'd be thinking about that outlook?Neil M. AsheYes. So let me contextualize first and then I'll dig in to answer the specifics of your question. We -- as we've said consistently, our plan is to provide annual guidance and not update that guidance through the year. We felt it important to identify for you that we weren't going to meet the lower end of our net sales guidance for the year, but we still are in the adjusted EPS range that we gave at the beginning of the year. And to be transparent, we're proud of that. So this has been a -- our teams have done really hard work to deliver the results that we're delivering this year to maintain dollar profit margin on lower sales, to increase margins, et cetera. So we feel really good about that. As we look forward to '24, as I said, we're going to take this one quarter at a time for right now. So we're not going to get too far ahead of ourselves on predicting '24. Our general indications are that the rest of this calendar year feels like it's going to be similar trends that we're having now, that could change. And we're confident in our ability to continue to grow the ISG business and then some of the growth initiatives that we're planning for ABL going forward. So our priority, as we've said through this environment, is to layer in margin, which we've demonstrated that we're doing. Whether or not we have sales growth, we're trying to layer in margin. We're trying to continue to deliver free cash flow, and we've delivered a ton of it, and we're going to continue to grow the Intelligent Spaces Group.OperatorOur next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.Ryan James MerkelI wanted to pick up on the orders again. Just sort of clear it, it sounds like orders are tracking sort of down mid-single digits, and you mentioned lead times and the macro. Can you just unpack those a little bit more? Is it distributor destocking? Is it tighter credit? What are some of the factors that are impacting the order rate decelerating a little bit here?Neil M. AsheYes. I will take a shot at that and, Karen, fill in any gaps that I leave in the explanation. So first, just to reiterate the bigger picture here. So looking back to last year, we had a combination of longer lead times and a price increase environment, which basically pulled forward a lot of orders. So we had a swelled backlog and we've been working through that backlog through this year. And through this quarter, it's starting to be back to about normal. So which means that in any period, we will basically ship what's ordered. So over the long arc of time, obviously, we will. But in a normal quarter, we will ship generally what's ordered in that quarter and a little bit from the quarter before. So we're starting to get to kind of more normalized levels there. On the positive side, those numbers are relatively consistent, absent volatility of the corporate accounts and the OEM, which I discussed in the first question. So that's -- we feel good about kind of where we are on that front. So as you look forward off of that, then the quarters as the next one, and this is why we're saying we're taking this one quarter at a time will be impacted by kind of normal macroeconomic trends. And I don't think -- we're looking at the same data you are, and we don't pretend to have a crystal ball. So our focus there is that we're going to -- or continue to get every piece of business we can get. All indications are from all of our data sources that we're either holding or taking share and we'll continue to try and layer in margin and deliver free cash flow in this environment.Ryan James MerkelGot it. That's helpful. And then another question I had was on project releases. I was hearing that tighter credit and shortage of switch gear was delaying the releases of projects. Are you guys seeing that? And any visibility as to when maybe that gets a little bit better?Neil M. AsheYes. So I'll take switchgear and then projects. First on switch gear. The lead times, as we understand it, have not yet -- have not compressed for switch gears. So just to put that in context, they were in the kind of 50-week range, so not days, weeks range. So they have been the bottleneck on many of the already funded projects. So that's the switch gear thing. Those will -- all those projects will continue to happen. And now that our lead times are basically normal, our expectation is that they will order their lighting for those projects on a more normal schedule. So that should play out over a while. In terms of new projects, that's really -- from our perspective, that's the macro environment. So with higher rates, I think everyone is going to relook at their projects. And so anecdotally, we have projects that are -- we have a fair number of projects in our independent sales network that are in queue, but they're being changed, modified, kind of reevaluated, those sorts of things, which is frankly normal. It's not abnormal. But it doesn't make it clear exactly what the market size is going to be, which is why again we're taking it quarter by quarter and we're focused on kind of layering the margins, delivering cash flow.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.Christopher M. SnyderSo the last couple of quarters, we've seen very significant 300 basis points gross margin expansion, but also pretty steep volume declines. And I know there's destocking headwinds. But is there a negative volume impact in response to the company's increased focus on margins? And Neil, I would just be interested in hearing about how you think about that trade-off and why the focus on margins is the right one for Acuity.Neil M. AsheYes. So I'll happily address that. And from our perspective, the -- we're very clear with our company on how we create value. We grow net sales, we turn profits into cash and we don't grow the balance sheet as fast. So as we look out strategically around price, volume, et cetera, our objective with the lighting, lighting control business is to be predictable, repeatable and scalable and we're delivering on that. So in the current environment, you're right, and Karen has indicated this on other call, that we have had more price than volume over the course of kind of this year. So -- and that's a combination of kind of all of the factors we've talked about before. And that is delivering the results that we are seeing. We also have all indications from our external sources that we're either maintaining or taking share in the process. So we're trying to guide the company to -- or steer the company to, as I said, this ability to be more predictable, repeatable and scalable in this business. So we do think these are the right choices. That is how we will create value. We'll grow net sales, we'll turn profits into cash and we won't grow the balance sheet as fast. And we're demonstrating that we can do that in a number of different market environments. We succeeded through the challenge of the pandemic when it was -- when things fell off. We succeeded when they shot up. And now I believe we're succeeding as we try and return to some normalized marketing -- or market environment.Christopher M. SnyderI appreciate that. And I wanted to follow up on the commentary around share gains, which is very impressive considering raising gross margin and taking share. I guess what gives you confidence that the company is taking share? Because I think investors see construction markets up 20% on the nonres side and obviously ABL down 7%. So how do we -- obviously, a big lag there. How should we think about -- or how do you guys think about the impact from the destock within that versus the potential share shifts, which are maybe more structural in nature?Neil M. AsheYes, sure. And so this is a -- this could be a soliloquy -- a long kind of PhD level soliloquy, but let me just kind of summarize it, that with the benefit of a lot of the data work that we've done, there is not a like-for-like correlation between the lighting industry and a specific same quarter external macro number that we can point to. That requires a basket to have any kind of a correlation and the correlations we've gotten are, kind of our squares of like 0.8. So we're in the good, not great range on the predictability of that. It takes multiples of those. The second is that our research has shown that generally, we are performing ahead of the general macroeconomic cycle, both for the good and for the not as good. So we're working through that now. So the direct answer to your question is there is -- it is not a surprise to us that those numbers would diverge the way you described it. Second thing that I would highlight there is the difference between nominal and real in the construction data. So that also, to the last question, is consistent with our performance as well. So there's -- I wish there were a more algebraic kind of tied to external market data that would predict our results, but there isn't. It's a basket, and we're not surprised by the relationship between those numbers that you described.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.Brian K. LeeI might have missed this, but -- and I hate to kind of beat a dead horse, but the lead time issue, could you elaborate a bit more maybe in quantitative terms just sort of where they are, where you want them to be, the sort of trajectory from here? And is it a purely destocking issue at the moment? Just maybe give us a frame of reference with some of the quantification, that would be helpful.Neil M. AsheYes. Brian, we covered this in some detail on the last quarter call. So I'll summarize it now, which is that kind of at the end of last fiscal year, our lead times and days were in the 50s range and now they're in the 20s range. So basically, we've reduced lead times by about 30 days. So that resulted in a buildup of backlog kind of towards the end of last fiscal year that we've been working through this year. And correspondingly, obviously, a little bit of an order drought as projects have been -- and needs have been pulled forward. So that's the big picture view of that and why -- and also why we've identified that we're starting to come back into balance and that basically we ship what's ordered over kind of basically a 60-day period.Karen J. HolcomYes, Brian, the only thing I would add is that last year, if you recall, we had several price increases as well, and that resulted in some of that pull forward that Neil described in addition to the lead time.Brian K. LeeOkay. Fair enough. Yes. I appreciate that clarification. And then I guess second question I had, and thanks for bringing it up, Karen, just around the price. I know you guys have gone away from talking specifics on price. But as you alluded to, last year, price was a meaningful tailwind. Historically, price has generally been, I think, maybe a plus or minus kind of low single-digit type of number for you all. Is that kind of where we are in terms of back to being toward a more normal? And then in relation to that, you've had a decent amount of product vitality, You introduced some new stuff and the Design Select as well. So maybe any high-level sense you can provide as to the impact on mix and price just as you're introducing a lot of these new products as well?Karen J. HolcomYes. Brian, I would just go back to our posture on strategic pricing that we talked about earlier. We have really focused on this discipline over the past couple of years. We talked about it with our Contractor Select portfolio, which is really a combination of 300 everyday lighting products that we're able to compete with the right product, the right place at the right price. So that gives us the ability to compete in a certain part of the market that a while ago we weren't able to compete in. And then if you look on the project side of the business, our strategic approach there is that we're able to pick the projects that we want and just be more disciplined about our pricing overall. So that's really what's driving the pricing that we're seeing today.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.Jeffrey Todd SpragueA lot of ground covered. I want to go a little bit further back just into what you're seeing in kind of the renovation markets in general. You obviously addressed kind of what you see in corporate account level. But anything you could kind of add there on kind of the vertical markets within that? You think this is mostly kind of a function of rates squeezing out marginal projects? Or any other color there would be interesting.Karen J. HolcomSure, Jeff. At ABL, the sales decreases by vertical are really what you would expect to see. We had declines in Industrial. If you recall, last year, we had a lot of warehouse and logistics projects that were taking place. And then also, we're seeing declines in health care and commercial office due to the impact of the wider macro environment. So really, nothing -- kind of nothing surprising on the vertical front.Neil M. AsheAnd on the renovation front, Jeff, I would say that change for us is good. So we've gotten a lot of questions about kind of what happens if the -- in the commercial office space or the commercial around the broader lending environment, valuations, et cetera. And so I would just use, I think everybody saw the Wall Street Journal article about the building on Market Street in San Francisco that had a $300 million valuation in 2019 and then was sold for $60 million recently. So while it's unpleasant experience for the capital side of that trade, the reality with that building is that it will now be reset at different rates, new tenants will move in and they will need to customize the space to what they want. And so they're going to need lighting and lighting controls. So that's kind of -- so that's anecdotally how renovation will play out for us over the next foreseeable future.Jeffrey Todd SpragueYes. And I guess that could be a 2- or 3-year process though, right, as kind of work from home and everything resettles. No great visibility on that, I would think. The -- could you just address a little bit more on -- also just on the price side. You were pretty explicit about managing the algorithm, right? And you've said it a couple of times, gross margin, lagging growth in the balance sheet to kind of leverage the capital base. But do you see an environment emerging where it, in fact, would make sense in that algorithm to just kind of overtly seed share in the name of protecting margins and cash flow? And do you see that sort of competitive pressure brewing or starting to emerge anywhere?Neil M. AsheYes, Jeff, the part of the reason we talk a lot about Contractor Select is that we have fundamentally changed our posture on product vitality. So we now have a product portfolio on a relatively consistent basis that is able to compete with all comers, and it allows us to deliver a margin at a price that's competitive in the marketplace. So that's a -- I think about the strategy around Contractor Select as really like what Kirkland is to Costco, Contractor Select is to the electrical distribution industry. In other words, it doesn't necessarily have to be the lowest priced product out there, but it is the highest value price and is competitive -- very competitive. That's allowed us to be in a very interesting position. And so we've tested this on price and whether we drive volume with price. And the -- and we've had really good results on that. So a little bit can go a long way there, which allows us to manage that. And to your ultimate question about which one -- which would we choose, I don't think we will unnecessarily chase share if we think it's going to impact us negatively on our value-creation algorithm. So we are very competitive. We're comfortable with our position in the marketplace from a competitive perspective because of all the vitality and productivity improvements we've demonstrated. And so now we really want to -- we want to make the Lighting and Lighting Control business as predictable and repeatable and scalable as we can for a longer period of time, which would deliver value for a lot of us. And then I don't want to answer this question without also highlighting the importance of the Intelligent Spaces Group and our portfolio. So as you saw this quarter, we continue to grow with Distech, we continue to grow Atrius, we continue to find -- we are finding ways where we can put capital to work to make that business better. So then the whole company hopefully looks different going forward. The lighting business is more predictable and repeatable and scalable with an obvious value creation algorithm, and we're growing the technology business at ISG.OperatorThank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Neil Ashe for any closing remarks.Neil M. AsheThank you, Liz. I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate the engagement and the questions. We had a solid quarter. We delivered margin and cash flow despite a decline in sales. We allocated capital effectively, and we continue to improve our underlying businesses. So thank you for your interest in Acuity Brands, and we look forward to seeing you again next quarter.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

The continued ""secret sauce"" of Cintas Corporation’s (Nasdaq: CTAS) award-winning ergonomics program? It begins with the impactful work done internally by its employee-partners on a daily basis.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230629405328/en/Cintas Corporation’s award-winning ergonomics program encourages solutions from the field where its frontline partners identify and invent creative solutions to make the jobs they do easier on their bodies. Through an in-house ergonomics competition and participation in international events like the annual Applied Ergonomics Conference (pictured), Cintas’ program has established leadership and innovation in the field. (Photo: Business Wire)""Our program is driven by frontline employee-partner activity,"" said Dr. Davana Pilczuk, Cintas’ Corporate Ergonomist. ""At Cintas, we feel the field employee-partners have inside knowledge as to how to improve their jobs, so our program is designed to listen to them. Most other companies have ergo programs that are expert-driven, meaning they have a staff of ergonomists making decisions and solving problems.""June is National Safety Month and an opportunity to shine light on the meaningful and impactful efforts of Cintas’ ergonomics program. The company’s heralded Health &amp; Safety team is focused on the well-being of Cintas’ employee-partners year round, and the ergonomics team has a specific emphasis on not only the workforce’s safety, but also improving workmanship quality and overall productivity.&gt;&gt; WATCH: Cintas at the 2023 Applied Ergonomics ConferenceThat also includes a pair of tentpole events that highlight the innovation and ingenuity that comes from the company’s front lines: an internal ergo competition and the company’s ongoing leadership and success at the field’s international competition and conference.Story continuesCintas’ award-winning ergonomics solutions begin in-house with a program that helps employee-partners perform their jobs more safely and efficiently, and inspires personal involvement in developing ergonomic solutions. The result: a true focus on the worker that separates Cintas from other companies in the space.Just one example is its ergonomics competition, which the company has staged for the last five years. The competition seeks to engage the workforce and encourages employee-partners to invent new and creative ways to make the jobs they do easier on their bodies.Last December, the Cintas-hosted competition featured 13 winners from more than 50 entries. Almost 200 employee-partners from the Rental, First Aid &amp; Safety and Fire Protection divisions, as well as its Global Supply Chain arm, logged on to learn the results of the in-house competition that earned the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA’s) Innovation Award in 2019.The internal contest has also served as a benchmark of several Fortune 500 companies.In March, Cintas was well-represented at the internationally recognized 26th annual Applied Ergonomics Conference (AEC) in New Orleans, with multiple employee-partners competing for the elite annual Ergo Cup and Excellence Awards.Since 2018, Cintas’ rich ergonomics leadership has been recognized regularly in the Ergo Cup. The company has won four Ergo Cup awards (2018, two in 2021, 2022) and three Excellence Awards (2019, 2022, 2023) in that time. Further, in 2023, Stephen Jenkins – Cintas’ Director of Health &amp; Safety and 2018 AEC Practitioner of the Year – gave the conference’s keynote address.Cintas’ unique combination of the participation and involvement of its employee-partners, as well as the awards they’ve garnered for their efforts to reduce wear from repetitive motions, provides the company opportunities to feature their frontline partners at international conferences like the Applied Ergonomics Conference.Cintas employee-partners and ergo experts staff booths and presentation spaces to talk about their solutions and how Cintas incorporates ergonomics into everyday work. Visitors at the event can get an up-close look at innovations that Cintas’ ergonomics program has provided for production, service and office situations.The collective buy-in and engagement from employee-partners in the Rental Division – the company’s largest – has identified efficiency improvements that are quantified by its ""motions saved"" metric. In fiscal year 2022 – the last full year of data available – that number reached an astounding 32 billion, with the company’s North Central Group leading the division.""The design of our program intentionally focuses on including each employee-partner as much as possible in the problem-solving process,"" Pilczuk said. ""Culture-driven programs like ours take years to develop, but once it is engrained into our business, we no longer have to solely rely on experts to solve problems.""We believe in empowering partners to speak up, lead and create change where needed,"" Pilczuk added.About Cintas CorporationCintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing products and services that help keep their customers’ facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best.

This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 5% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.25% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Walmart as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Walmart to post earnings of $1.68 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 5.08%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $159.34 billion, up 4.24% from the year-ago period.WMT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.21 per share and revenue of $636.67 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -1.27% and +4.15%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Walmart.

But they are also a treasure trove for criminals looking to trick people out of their hard-earned money.See: I Lost $400K of My Retirement Savings in a Roth 401(k) — If You’re Not Careful, You Could, TooFind: 6 Steps To Take To Become a Millionaire by 30Top Class Actions reported that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has ordered retail giant Walmart to pay a total of nearly $4 million in remission payments to consumers stemming from gift card scams that started in 2015.After discovering the fraud, Walmart reportedly froze card balances in 2016 and 2017, typically for amounts between $500 and $1,000. If you were a victim of one of these scammers between the beginning of April 2016 and the end of July 2017, you could benefit from the Walmart remission payment decision.If you were a victim of a scam resulting from a Walmart gift card bought during the fraudulent scheme period and believe you are owed money, check out eligibility qualifications, remission payment amount and claim filing instructions below.Who is Eligible To Receive a Remission Payment?Fraud victims may be eligible for a remission payment if they purchased and were sent a Walmart gift card from an unknown fraudster between April 1, 2016 and July 31, 2016 — the period when Walmart seized gift cards and froze balances that were connected to suspected fraud. You don’t have to be a U.S. citizen, according to the DOJ Walmart Gift Card Remission FAQ page.How Much Money Will Be Repaid?Remission payments are based on the amount loaded onto the compromised gift card in question (values were typically between $500 and $1,000). The payment issued will most likely be less than the amount a customer lost because many victims have already received recoveries from a bank or other source. Money transfer fees, incidental losses, transfers sent through other companies or other collateral expenses can’t be recovered.Story continuesHow To File a Claim for a Remission Payment From WalmartThose qualifying for a remission payment can file a Petition for Remission online securely on the case website — or you may file a Petition for Remission you received via mail. You may mail the petition to: Walmart Gift Card Remission Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 6175, Novato, CA 94948-6175. Make sure you enter all requested information that applies to your claim. Failure to do so could result in your petition being deemed deficient and potentially delay payment. The deadline for victims to file a remission form is July 14, 2023.Important Things To Keep in MindIf your petition for remission is approved, it will reviewed by the Treasury Offset Program to make sure you don’t owe any money to the federal government or have state government debts. Your remission payment will be used to pay outstanding debts if you owe money. Hence, claimants will need to provide their Social Security number.Filing a false claim is punishable under penalty of perjury. If you do not qualify for this settlement, don’t file a claim. If you’re unsure if you qualify, please read the FAQ section of the DOJ’s settlement website.For the latest information about the remission process, check the Walmart Gift Card Remission home page for updates, email info@walmartgiftcardremission.com or call 1-888-846-6824.More From GOBankingRatesMark Cuban Says This Is the No. 1 Thing To Do To Build WealthWhy Home Prices Are Plummeting in These 6 Cities3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Financial Goals That Are Easy To Stick To All YearThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Walmart Will Pay 4 Million Dollars in Scam Compensation: Are You Eligible for Payment?]"

However, the metrics declined year over year.Results have gained from strong script growth, solid pharmacy margins and progress in its turnaround program. On the flip side, the underperformance in front-end sales in the Retail Pharmacy Segment and a higher-than-expected medical loss ratio at Elixir Insurance acted as deterrents.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have plunged 29.6% in the past three months compared with the industry's decline of 11.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q1 HighlightsRite Aid incurred an adjusted loss of 73 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.49. However, the figure was wider than the prior-year quarter’s loss of 60 cents.Revenues declined 6% from the year-ago quarter to $5,356.2 million but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,352 million. This was mainly due to the reduction in the company’s Prescription Drug Plan membership and the loss of commercial clients at Elixir, partly offset by increased Retail Pharmacy segment revenues stemming from higher pharmacy sales.In the fiscal first quarter, the Retail Pharmacy segment's revenues rose 3.4%, driven by an increase in acute and maintenance prescriptions, somewhat offset by reduced COVID-19 vaccine and testing revenues, and store closures.Retail Pharmacy same-store sales moved up 8.4%, driven by a 13.3% rise in pharmacy sales, somewhat offset by a 4.4% decline in front-end same-store sales. Excluding cigarettes and tobacco products, front-end same-store sales fell 3.8% from the year-ago period’s reading.Prescription count at same-store sales, adjusted to 30-day equivalent, rose 4.7% on the back of non-COVID-19 prescriptions (up 7.4%), acute prescriptions (up 6.8%) and maintenance prescriptions (up 7.6%). Prescription sales constituted 73.9% of overall drugstore sales. The total store count at the end of the reported quarter was 2,284.In the Pharmacy Services segment, revenues declined 31% due to the client loss announced earlier and reduced Elixir Insurance membership, partly offset by increased utilization and a rise in drug costs.In the reported quarter, adjusted EBITDA fell 18% from the year-ago period to $21.7 million.

RGF or Real Good Foods is making waves in the health and wellness food industry as it expands its product line and strengthens its partnership with retail giant Walmart WMT. The leading health and wellness frozen food company has revealed plans to expand its innovative Breaded Chicken and Asian Entrees platforms to more than 4,000 Walmart stores nationwide by the end of June 2023.This expansion represents a major stride toward Real Good Foods' overarching mission of enhancing the lives of millions by making nutritious food more accessible. With more than 90% of Americans residing within a 10-mile radius of a Walmart store, the increased distribution will ensure that a vast number of people have convenient access to Real Good Foods' products.One of the standout offerings from Real Good Foods is Breaded Chicken Nuggets &amp; Strips. Compared to the leading breaded chicken brand available in grocery stores, Real Good Foods' products contain nearly double the protein and significantly lower carbs. Moreover, they are low in sodium. This distinction stems from Real Good Foods' use of proprietary breading that is high in protein, grain-free, and gluten-free, as opposed to processed sugar, flour and grains found in conventional chicken nuggets. In addition, Real Good Foods utilizes whole muscle chicken breast, resulting in just 2-3 grams of net carbs and an impressive 23 grams of protein per serving.Another compelling offering from Real Good Foods is its Asian Entrees, which offers 1 gram of sugar and 20 grams or more of protein per serving. In comparison, other Asian entrees currently available in the market contain over 45 grams of sugar per box and less protein. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBryan Freeman, the executive chairman of Real Good Foods, acknowledged the growing demand for nutritious options among consumers. He emphasized the significance of the company's expansion into Walmart stores, which will now make these healthier food choices easily accessible. Freeman expressed pride in being able to offer delicious and nutritious options that address the lack of access to better foods, a key factor behind the rising diabetes epidemic.Real Good Foods' partnership with Walmart presents an exciting opportunity for both companies. With an increased reach across the nation, Real Good Foods can make a positive impact on the health and well-being of individuals, while Walmart can enhance its product portfolio and cater to the rising demand for healthier food choices. As the expansion rolls out, Real Good Foods remains committed to improving human health and looks forward to further opportunities to accomplish this goal.Story continuesStock PerformanceReal Good Food Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, its focus on the LeoVegas acquisition bodes well. However, the decline in visitation from pre-pandemic levels is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for now.Factors Driving GrowthSports betting and iGaming continue to be a major growth driver for the company. To this end, BetMGM continues to gain market share. As of March 2023, BetMGM achieved a market share of 28% in the iGaming and 17% in the U.S. sports betting space. During the first quarter, net gaming revenues from BetMGM came in at $476 million, up 76% from 2022 levels. Attributes such as robust player economics and a successful bonus optimization strategy added to the positives. Considering the positive market momentum and its unique and unparalleled online and offline offerings, the company is optimistic about long-term growth, with revenue expectations of $1.8-$2 billion in 2023. The company is confident about the improved design and functionality of the BetMGM app launch (of a single wallet) and omnichannel growth prospects.The company emphasizes on international expansion to drive growth. To this end, MGM Resorts made progress related to development plans in Japan and Dubai. It is working on its plans to expand its footprint in New York. The company is currently working through the RFA process and plans to submit the official application in summer 2023. The total spending expectation for its New York expansion is approximately $2 billion (including licensing fee). Going forward, the company intends to invest more than $2 billion into its properties to boost customer experiences and services. Also, the initiative is likely to support the needed technology platform and advanced analytics to better engage and service its guests and drive market share in its principal markets.Story continuesThe company is benefiting from a healthy demand for leisure time, loosened travel restrictions and significant contributions from the Las Vegas market. During the first quarter of 2023, Las Vegas Strip Resorts' net income came in at $2,176.2 million, up 31% year over year. The positive was brought on by an increase in business volume, travel and the opening of The Cosmopolitan. During the quarter, net revenues from regional operations reached $945.8 million, up 6% from prior-year quarter’s levels. The uptick was primarily driven by an increase in non-gaming business volume. MGM remains bullish on its domestic business outlook.The company also emphasized on the completion of the LeoVegas acquisition. The initiative supports the company’s expansion in international markets and online gaming and paves a path to drive its omnichannel strategy and generate incremental earnings between brick-and-mortar and online channels. On May 1, 2023, MGM internationally announced the first major investment by its subsidiary, LeoVegas, which entered into an agreement to acquire the majority of a game developer, Push Gaming. This investment will help the company expand its digital business on an international scale.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, shares of MGM Resorts have gained 46.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 45.5%.ConcernsAlthough the company resumed operations in most of its properties, traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels.

In the three months to the end of June, the contract finished down 6%.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled up 78 cents, or 1.1% at $70.64 a barrel. It posted its second straight quarterly drop, down about 6.5% in the latest three months.Prices have been under pressure from rising interest rates in key economies and a slower than expected recovery in Chinese manufacturing and consumption.Signs of strengthening U.S. economic activity and sharp declines in U.S. oil inventories last week offered some support.For the day, crude was bolstered by a U.S. Commerce Department report showing annual inflation rising last month at its slowest pace in two years.Signs of moderating inflation ""could hold the Federal Reserve off rising interest rates again,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.The market was also supported by upward revisions in demand for crude oil and refined products in the United States.Demand for crude and petroleum products fell slightly to 20.446 million bpd in April but remained seasonally strong, EIA data showed.Prices also drew support from Saudi Arabia's plans to cut output by a further 1 million barrels per day in July in addition to a broader OPEC+ deal to limit supply into 2024.""Despite the announcements of two fresh rounds of cuts from OPEC+/Saudi Arabia, crude prices have largely remained below $80 a barrel as the market has been driven less by fundamentals and more by macroeconomic concerns,"" HSBC analysts said in a note.""We think this will continue to be the case for part of the summer, although the deep deficit of around 2.3 million barrels forecast for 2H23 should help to spur some upwards price momentum.""Story continuesA Reuters survey of 37 economists and analysts showed oil prices will struggle for traction this year as global economic headwinds linger.U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating for a ninth week in a row for the first time since July 2020, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.(Additional reporting by Ron Bousso in London, Arathy Somasekhar in Houston and Muyu Xu in Singapore; editing by Robert Birsel, Jason Neely, David Evans, Louise Heavens and David Gregorio)]"

""Yet despite currently elevated prices, drivers are not cutting back on travel this summer.”More: Gas prices need a fix, and changing Arizona's fuel blend is an option, lawmakers sayNew data released by the Energy Information Administration, as cited by AAA, showed a slight decrease in gas demand since last week, falling from 9.38 million barrels per day to 9.31 million. Total domestic gasoline stocks rose, however, to the tune of 600,000 barrels of crude oil, now resting at 220 million.Story continues""Lower gas demand amid increasing supply has helped to limit pump price increases.

The People’s Bank of China has consistently injected cash into the economy to stimulate growth this year, and recently cut interest rates for the first time in ten months.Brent oil futures rose 0.1% to $74.60 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures were flat at $69.90 a barrel by 22:07 ET (02:07 GMT).

GasBuddy Head of Petroleum Analysis Patrick De Haan joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the international consumption factors that could loom over summer gas prices, while commenting on California's new price gouging law.Video Transcript- Well, gas prices have been steadily declining, with the national average now at $3.55 a gallon. That is welcome news, with nearly 40% of drivers planning a road trip over the July 4th weekend. That's at least according to GasBuddy's new summer travel survey that marks a 9% jump from last year.For more, let's bring-- let's welcome in Patrick de Haan, GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis. Patrick, what does this all mean in terms of the demand picture?PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, you know, a lot of Americans have started to make the transition in light of last year's record setting prices. Some Americans have made the transition over EVs. It probably won't be a record setting holiday weekend for gasoline consumption. There are still some slowdowns that we're seeing when it comes to gasoline consumption.And so I would look for gasoline demand to be about 9.4 million barrels. That's still one of the higher numbers that we've seen so far this year. But that's going to be down from about 10 million barrels that we saw back in 2019. So still a lot of Americans hitting the road. Gas prices now $1.35 on average, below what they were a year ago. That's going to save Americans about $20 every time they fill their tank up.Most welcome is 47 of the nation's 50 states seeing average prices over $1 a gallon less than what we saw a year ago.- Patrick, you just mentioned the average price there, $3.55. There was talk going into the summer that we could retest $4 a gallon. Is that still on the table, do you think?PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, it's still a low level possibility. Especially in August, we've already seen some tropical disturbances. That can affect refinery operations. Half of the nation's refining capacity is on the coast in Texas and Louisiana. So Mother Nature, if we don't see her play nice, there still could be an impact.Story continuesThough I think the odds are rather low. It's something to watch for, especially in August, once we get into the peak of hurricane season.- Yeah, it's certainly a good time to kind of look ahead to the rest of the year, Patrick. The second half of the year, at least. You look at where oil prices have been trading. You know, we're still seeing a lot of supply coming online from Russia despite the cuts that we've heard from OPEC plus or at least Saudi Arabia. As we look to the second half of the year, I mean, where do you expect some of these prices to trend?PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, I think we could go a little bit lower. I think really a lot of the disappointment that has offset OPEC's production cuts has been China. Chinese demand has been very soft, very lackluster, even as their economy has reopened after COVID-19. And the thinking earlier this year was that China could have a tremendous reopening that could spark global consumption. But it really hasn't panned out yet.And I think the second half of the summer, especially as we get into the fall, we could eventually see the national average falling below $3 a gallon with the typical caveats. Again, hurricane season and refinery disruptions are the wild card. But once you get into October and November, we could see the national average making a run at that sub $3 a gallon level.- Patrick, even though we are seeing prices declining we are seeing states, some states taking action, trying to limit some of the very high prices that we saw. Just about a year ago, California has a new law that they just passed aimed at stopping oil companies from what they say inflating gas prices. I was taking a look at your Twitter account, and you were saying that this could potentially backfire. Why?PATRICK DE HAAN: Well, you know, a lot of politicians have demonized the oil sector as being the lone wolf as the reason for higher prices. But what a lot of californians don't realize is the cost of regulations is extremely high. That's why California has almost always led the nation with the highest gas prices, because they have their own blend of fuel. They essentially tell refiners how to do it. In addition to having clap and trade and wildly high gasoline taxes.So it's going to shed light on how the industry works. But it also could shed light onto how those regulations impact the price of gasoline.- Yeah. I mean, looking at just how this would work in California, I mean, it specifically calls for oil companies to hand over additional information. It's not sort of just jumping on and saying, well, you know, we will decide who's actually price gouging. So ultimately, isn't that additional information a good thing?PATRICK DE HAAN: Yeah, the price transparency is certainly good. Especially if people sit down and try to understand how it all works. Especially if the government makes it clear how taxes and regulation impact those refinery operations. So absolutely shining a light on it is not a bad thing. But again, will the government disclose that a lot of the burden from high prices are from regulations in California?- Finally, Patrick, we're noticing this banner here. Norton Shores, Michigan. What's going on behind you? Is that just close to home?PATRICK DE HAAN: We've got a station-- yeah, it's, you know, I've hit the road myself already, making a jump start. The station behind me here today earlier today was at $3.59. And since, then the station is now charging basically the national average. So the perfect example right behind me of a station that's about $1.50 below a year ago to kick off the July 4 weekend.- OK, certainly a good example there. Patrick de Haan, GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis. Great to have you on today. Enjoy the long holiday weekend.PATRICK DE HAAN: Thanks for having me.]"

Per Statista, advertising revenues increased from $194.7 billion in 2014 to $343.5 billion in 2022, delivering a constant growth except 2020 when the industry took a hit due to the pandemic.We believe this is the appropriate time to invest in a booming market and pick regular dividend-paying stocks. Dividends create a reliable source of return without selling shares.Industry and its trendsPer Statista, advertising revenues are expected to reach $424.3 billion by 2027. Internet advertising has been gradually replacing traditional TV advertising, contributing nearly 63% to advertisement revenues in 2022. The metric is expected to be 68% by 2027. Online advertising revenues has seen a surge in the past five years, growing 130% to nearly $210 billion in 2022. The inclusion of artificial intelligence is adding to growth of online advertising. Paid search, podcasts and videos are some of the main avenues of digital ad spend.In the past year,theadvertising and marketing industry has rallied 24.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composites’ 14.6% increase and the Business Services sector’s 3.6% rise.Why Dividend paying stockIn case of market volatility, dividend stocks can be a go to option for investors.

He glanced back briefly at his wife, Taundra, who exited the courtroom with his Perry County Ducks Unlimited ball cap folded in her hands.Ahead of his sentencing, Householder stood before Black to make a personal appeal for leniency, saying it was not himself that a harsh prison sentence would hurt most but his spouse of 40 years, his sons, grandchildren and friends.“I wasn't power hungry. I went home,” he said of his departure from the Ohio House between speakerships. Householder told the judge that he and his wife had given “every ounce of energy we have to make life better for others.”In a blistering rebuke, Black threw back at Householder evidence counter to the family man image he had presented. He quoted Householder's own statements, presented at trial, saying: “If you’re going to f—- with me, I’m going to f—- with your kids,” “we can f— with him later” and “f—- him ’til he’s dead.”Black called Householder “a bully with a lust for power” whose scheme marked an “assault on democracy, the betrayal of everyone in Ohio.” That included the Ohioans who donated to, campaigned for and voted for Householder, the judge said.“That wasn't their way of just saying I like you or I support you. What they were saying is I'm choosing to trust you,” said Black. “They trusted you to do right by them, and you betrayed their trust.”Householder and lobbyist Matt Borges, a former chair of the Ohio Republican Party, were both convicted in March of a single racketeering charge each, after a six-week trial. Borges is set to be sentenced Friday.Story continuesJurors found that Householder orchestrated and Borges participated in a $60 million bribery scheme secretly funded by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. to secure Householder’s power, elect his allies, pass legislation containing a $1 billion bailout for two aging nuclear power plants owned by a FirstEnergy affiliate and then to use a dirty tricks campaign to stifle a ballot effort to overturn the bill.Federal prosecutors had recommended Householder receive 16 to 20 years, holding in a sentencing memo that he “acted as the quintessential mob boss, directing the criminal enterprise from the shadows and using his casket carriers to execute the scheme.” That strategy, they said, gave Householder ”plausible deniability.”His own attorneys had recommended just 12 to 18 months, reporting to the judge that he is “a broken man” who has been “humiliated and disgraced” by the ordeal of his widely reported arrest, high-profile prosecution and seven-week trial by jury.Outside the courthouse Thursday, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Ken Parker said the government was grateful for the judge's sentence.“We heard Mr. Householder indicate that he keeps close his faith, his family and his friends. I would have added one more: He needs to keep close the Ohioans, if he is going to serve this state. That's what he left out,” Parker said. “That's why he was here today and that's why the judge imposed the highest level of accountability under the statute.”Rachel Belz, CEO of the government watchdog group Ohio Citizen Action, expressed hope that Householder’s sentence would help restore public trust and allow the voice of the people to be “heard and valued” by decision makers.“Democracy does not allow our leaders to wield power without the opportunity for the people to exercise a check on that power,” she said in a statement.Householder was one of Ohio’s most powerful politicians, a historically twice-elected speaker, before his indictment. After his July 2020 arrest, the Republican-controlled House ousted him from his leadership post, but he refused to resign for nearly a year on grounds he was innocent until proven guilty. In a bipartisan vote, representatives ultimately ousted him from the chamber in 2021 — the first such expulsion in Ohio in 150 years.All told, five people and a dark money group have been charged so far for their roles in the scheme. A federal investigation remains ongoing.During the trial, the prosecution called two of the people arrested — Juan Cespedes and Jeff Longstreth, who both pleaded guilty and are cooperating — to testify about political contributions they said were not ordinary, but rather bribes intended to secure passage of the bailout legislation. Generation Now, the 501(c) nonprofit through which much of the money flowed, also has pleaded guilty to racketeering.Cespedes and Longstreth face up to six months in prison each under their plea deals. Neither has been sentenced.The last person arrested, the late Statehouse superlobbyist Neil Clark, was heard on tape in the courtroom. Clark had pleaded not guilty before dying by suicide in March 2021.All the alleged members of the conspiracy benefited personally from the scheme, using sums that an FBI agent described colloquially as “bags of cash” from FirstEnergy. Householder spent around $500,000 of FirstEnergy money to settle a business lawsuit, pay attorneys, deal with expenses at his Florida home and pay off credit card debt. Another $97,000 was used to pay staff and expenses for his 2018 reelection campaign.]"

The work also involves the installation of fresh underground transformers and safety equipment that can quickly identify and isolate damage when issues arise and redirect electricity through nearby lines to stop or reduce the length of power outages.Additionally, a new transformer and protective device were recently changed, and crews plan to replace another six pieces of crucial equipment this summer and fall. This electrical circuit replacement is a part of Penelec’s Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP II), a $200 million initiative to accelerate capital investments in the company's electric distribution system over five years.Need for UpgradesUnderground cables increase the resilience of the entire electric distribution system and allow the utility operator to provide 24x7 services to customers during extreme climatic conditions. Even though the maintenance requirements of the underground cables are lower compared with overhead lines, maintenance of the underground cables is essential for smooth operation during summer months when demand for electricity rises.The Regulated Distribution segment of FirstEnergy plans to invest more than $9 billion (or 53% of the entire FirstEnergy investment plan) from 2021 to 2025. Strengthening the transmission and renewable generation assets will allow the company to transmit electricity even during adverse weather conditions.Utilities’ Focus on InfrastructureAlong with FirstEnergy, other utility companies like DTE Energy Co. DTE, NiSource Inc. NI and Xcel Energy Inc. XEL are adopting measures to strengthen their existing infrastructure.DTE Electric expects to make capital investments of $18 billion over 2023-2027.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) implies an increase of 1.6% over 2022’s reported figure.NiSource invested $2.6 billion in 2022 and expects to invest $3.3-$3.6 billion in 2023. It projects an investment of approximately $15 billion during the 2023-2027 period, including capital investments to support the generation transition strategy.NI’s long-term earnings growth rate is 7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS implies an increase of 8.8% over 2022’s reported figure.Xcel Energy aims to spend $29.5 billion during the 2023-2027 time frame. It plans to invest nearly $18 billion for strengthening its electric distribution and transmission operations in the same period. Nearly $0.9 billion will be invested to enhance its renewable power generation operations.XEL’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.3%.

51,744aea2a-dec3-370f-85a4-c4e7e782d58f,CRM,2023-06-30,"The U.K. loves Big A.I., and Big A.I. is returning the favor",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-k-loves-big-big-162356510.html,1688055836,STORY,['CRM'],"[In the past couple days, both OpenAI and Salesforce have announced significant investments in the U.K.—the ChatGPT maker said yesterday that it would be opening its first non-U.S. office in London, while Salesforce said today that it would be investing a whopping $4 billion in its British operations.It’s not too hard to figure out why the U.K. is so popular with Big A.I. Under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the country has adopted a light-touch approach to the regulation of A.I., to help it “seize the opportunities” of the A.I. boom. (See also Sunak’s welcoming approach to crypto, which led a16z to open its first international office in London.) Instead of proposing new laws, the U.K. is leaving oversight of A.I.’s rise to existing regulators such as the British health and safety agency and its antitrust watchdog.Salesforce in particular is being very clear that this friendly stance spurred its mega-investment, which dwarfs the $2.5 billion it put into the U.K. over the past five years.“A clear pro-innovation regulatory framework that compels safe and responsible use of A.I. is vital, and Salesforce is fully focused on bringing secure, trusted, enterprise ready generative A.I. to U.K. businesses,” said Zahra Bahrololoumi, CEO of Salesforce U.K. and Ireland, in a statement this morning.Salesforce’s investment is very good news for the otherwise beleaguered Sunak, who described it as “a ringing endorsement of our economy.” (Meanwhile, OpenAI’s statement on its U.K. expansion focused more on London, which VP of people Diane Yoon described as “a city globally renowned for its rich culture and exceptional talent pool.”)But this week’s celebrations also carry an implicit threat for those that are considering serious A.I. regulation, in particular the European Union, which the U.K. left a few years ago.The EU’s A.I. Act is currently in its final legislative stage—the behind-closed-doors “trilogue” negotiations between the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the governments of EU countries. As it stands, the bill would be catastrophic for A.I. vendors because, as recent research has shown, every single foundation model out there would fall foul of its provisions. In particular, the likes of OpenAI will struggle to disclose which copyrighted material their models were trained on, as the law would require.Story continuesJust over a month ago, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a heavy-handed attempt to threaten the EU over its approach, saying his company could leave the world’s second-largest consumer market if it “overregulated” A.I. European lawmakers do not take kindly to such threats, and angrily retorted that they wouldn’t be swayed. Altman quickly backtracked, trilling: “We are excited to continue to operate [in the EU] and of course have no plans to leave.”So what’s more effective? Issuing threats you don’t intend to back up, or showing the governments of EU countries that their neighbor, which isn’t rolling out red tape, is getting a bunch of investment from the kings of the next big thing? “All this could be yours if you water down the A.I. Act in its final stage,” is the underlying message that I’m reading here.But Big A.I. should be cautious about its future in the U.K. Sunak may be the ideal host, but he may not be in charge for much longer. The country will have to hold a general election sometime within the next 19 months, and polling points to a resounding victory for the opposition Labour Party.“We are nowhere near where we need to be on the question of [A.I.] regulation,” said Labour Leader Keir Starmer earlier this month, promising an “overarching regulatory framework” to tackle the technology’s risks. OpenAI and Salesforce can’t say they weren’t warned.More news below.Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.David MeyerData Sheet’s daily news section was written and curated by Andrea Guzman.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

52,2b05dfdb-6a90-342c-80d3-e56d1d51ecd1,CRM,2023-06-30,Salesforce and GlobalFoundries have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-globalfoundries-highlighted-zacks-bull-134000285.html,1688046000,STORY,"['GFS', 'CRM', 'HLNE', 'MATX', 'ISTR']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 29, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Salesforce CRM as the Bull of the Day and GlobalFoundries Inc. GFS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Matson, Inc. MATX, Investar Holding Corp. ISTR and Hamilton Lane Inc. HLNE.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Salesforce stock has been one of the big winners during the first half of 2023, up nearly 60%.Despite all the talk about large-cap tech being overvalued and overheated heading into July, Salesforce still trades 30% below its all-time highs. And CRM’s new commitment to profits, coupled with its growth outlook, has Salesforce stock trading at some extremely attractive valuation levels.Salesforce’s expansive portfolio of subscription software offerings are also more essential than ever before across every aspect of the economy.Price, Technical Levels &amp; ValuationSalesforce shares have soared nearly 60% YTD to outshine Amazon, Apple, and many other big tech stocks. Even after its impressive ride, CRM currently trades 10% below its average Zacks price target and roughly 32% under its 2021 peaks.CRM has underperformed the wider Zacks Tech Sector over the last five years, up 55% vs. 85%, as Wall Street appeared to grow frustrated with its commitment to growth over the bottom line—but that is changing (as we will get to).Salesforce has soared 450% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 260%, with it also up roughly 1,140% in the last 15 years to triple the tech sector and roughly match Microsoft. One of the nearby charts also showcases CRM’s massive run since its 2004 IPO year.Salesforce has pulled back from the 52-week highs it hit at the end of May. The small drop pushed it below oversold RSI territory and right to neutral levels.Plus, CRM stock recently found support at its 50-day moving average, while trading far above its 200-day. Technical-focused traders might also be glad to know that Salesforce is once again above both its 200-week and 50-week moving averages.Story continuesThe downturn coupled with its improved earnings outlook has Salesforce trading at 35.7X forward 12-month earnings. This marks a massive discount to its own five-year highs of 206X and 70% value compared to its five-year median.CRM’s PEG ratio, which factors in its growth outlook, currently comes in at its lowest levels since the financial crisis at 1.9. Salesforce’s PEG ratio also marks a discount to Zacks Tech sector and solid value vs. Microsoft’s 2.7, Apple’s 2.3, and its Computer-Software industry’s 2.6.The Business and Its Profitability PivotSalesforce is one of the pioneers of modern business software and the wider customer relationship management and software-as-a-service industries. CRM’s current offerings support sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond, servicing a wide spectrum of the economy.Salesforce, like nearly every tech company, is pushing forward into the booming world of artificial intelligence. The company is currently working to infuse “trusted, secure generative AI across our entire product portfolio. Salesforce's generative AI ecosystem wields Einstein GPT, Slack GPT, and Tableau GPT, delivering trusted power across our product portfolio.”Salesforce made a few large acquisitions over the last several years to expand its reach. These efforts include its $28 billion deal to buy Slack in the summer of 2021 to help CRM compete against Microsoft and others in the evolving work communication space. The deal came roughly two years after Salesforce paid $15 billion for data analytics platform Tableau.These recent deals could mark the last in a long time for Salesforce as it focuses on the bottom line following a successful activist investor push. CEO Marc Benioff said on its Q4 FY23 (2022) earnings call on March 1 that the goal “is to make Salesforce the largest and most profitable software company in the world.”Salesforce’s transformation plan includes short-term and long-term restructuring. Salesforce also said earlier this year that it disbanded its M&amp;A committee. Salesforce is focused on a transformational FY24 that includes a beefed-up share repurchase plan from $10 billion to $20 billion.Growth and OutlookSalesforce posted between roughly 25% to 35% sales growth for 10 straight years through its fiscal 2022. CRM then grew its revenue by 18% in fiscal 2023 (last year).Zacks estimates call for Salesforce’s revenue to climb by roughly 11% in both FY24 and FY25 to see it hit $38.47 billion. These are the kinds of stable low double-digit sales growth figures  (mostly organic) that Wall Street will love as long as it is accompanied by solid bottom line expansion.Salesforce’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 42% this year to hit $7.44 per share and then climb by about 21% next year to $8.99 a share. These growth projections follow 10% adjusted earnings growth last year. Plus, Salesforce has beaten our quarterly EPS estimates for five years running.Bottom LineSalesforce’s subscription software offerings aren’t going out of style in our digital-driven world. The tech giant’s new-found focus on margins and profitability should also start to attract long-term investors to again, as will its AI efforts.Salesforce’s upbeat earnings outlook helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as we close out June and look ahead to the potentially bullish second half.Bear of the Day:GlobalFoundries Inc. is one of the leading semiconductor foundries on the planet. But the stock has underperformed the chip market in 2023 and its earnings outlook is trending in the wrong direction.The BasicsThe U.S. is increasingly focused on onshoring more chip manufacturing, especially with the world’s largest foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor, possibly coming under pressure from the Chinese government at some point in the future. GlobalFoundries is a much smaller U.S.-based player in the vital chip manufacturing or foundry segment.GlobalFoundries is poised to gain momentum and market share as those in power realize the U.S. must play a larger role in actual chip manufacturing. GFS, which builds chips in the U.S. and other countries outside of China and Taiwan, works across a wide spectrum of semiconductor categories.GlobalFoundries is exposed to growth in mobile devices, data centers, IoT, automotive, and beyond. Originally an AMD spinoff, GlobalFoundries found early success after its October 2021 IPO.The stock has bounced around since then, with GlobalFoundries down 1% since the middle of November 2021. Narrowing our view, GFS shares are up 17% YTD and 45% over the last 12 months, which lags its industry’s climb. The stock is also currently trading above both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.GlobalFoundries posted 23% revenue growth in 2022, but it faces near-term headwinds in the historically cyclical chip industry.Zacks estimates call for the company’s adjusted earnings to slip 30% YoY to $2.18 per share on around 7% lower revenue. The nearby chart also shows that GlobalFoundries FY23 and FY24 consensus earnings estimates have faded recently, down 8% and 10%, respectively. Bottom LineGlobalFoundries lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment given its downward earnings revisions. GlobalFoundries also earns an “F” grade for Value and a “D” for Momentum in our Style Scores system right now.Semiconductors are one of the backbones of the economy. GlobalFoundries could, therefore, be a solid longer-term play, but its earnings and revenue are projected to slide in 2023 and its earnings revisions have continued to trend in the wrong direction.It might be best for investors to look beyond GlobalFoundries right now to some of the many other semiconductor stocks that are currently sitting at Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buys) or #2 (Buys).Additional content:3 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes as Inflation PrevailsThe Fed decided to keep its interest rates unaltered for the first time in 15 months in its June FOMC meeting. The decision was cheered by investors that sent stocks on a rally. However, all three major indexes snapped their multiweek winning streaks last week as concerns of the economy slipping into a recession grew once again.This saw the Dow ending 1.7% lower last week, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq each finished 1.4% lower, snapping their five and eight straight weeks of gains.Inflation has shown signs of easing, but the Fed has said that the crisis is far from over. Fed Chair Jerome Powell maintained his hawkish stance last week during his Congressional testimony. He said that two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each will be required by the end of this year.The Fed has increased interest rates by 500 basis points since March 2022, with the terminal interest rate now at 5.6% instead of 5.125%. The Fed’s decision to continue with its interest rate hikes comes as inflation is still a lot elevated than its target level of 2%.Understandably, market participants are concerned about the economy’s health and are trying to gauge the Fed’s next course of action. Given the Fed’s stance and the multi-year high inflation, it is unlikely that the first interest rate cut will be any time before 2025, although market participants believe it could also be some time in 2024.Markets are thus likely to remain volatile for a longer period than expected, maybe throughout this year.Stocks in FocusGiven this situation, investing in dividend-paying stocks would be a wise decision. Dividend stocks with a solid business plan and a proven track record are known for handling market volatility. An astute investor should thus consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Juniper Networks has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Motorola has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that JNPR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.JNPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.01, while MSI has a forward P/E of 25.23. We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 1.78. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.80.Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P/B ratio of 2.21. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MSI has a P/B of 190.98.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, JNPR holds a Value grade of B, while MSI has a Value grade of C.JNPR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MSI, so it seems like value investors will conclude that JNPR is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And if they did, no way did they anticipate the hype around the nascent technology and explosive stock price gains.Yet here we stand with the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 (think: Nvidia, Microsoft, Google) now accounting for about 22% of the overall index thanks to these big gains, the most concentrated the index has been since at least 1980, Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells me.It's wild.morning brief imageAnother surprise was the banking crash several months ago.Who in the world expected a wave of all-out bank busts. Credit Suisse owned by UBS? Crazy!Where the surprises haven't come from is on the economic front, which is interesting in light of the Fed's aggressive rate hikes making their way through the housing, auto and consumer sectors.The economy has chugged along — albeit at a slow pace — but hasn't shocked the markets.But those lack of economic surprises could change soon as the Fed eyes potentially two more rate increases this year. Said surprises may start on the jobs front, argues veteran Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner.""We forecast a significant slowdown in monthly non-farm payroll growth this year that falls below the 90k replacement rate in 4Q23, and bottoms in January 2024 at 40k before gradually improving to 72k/month in 2024,"" Zentner said in a note this week that deserved a lot more attention than it got (hence, we are discussing it in these pages).Is a negative jobs report lurking? (Morgan Stanley)Zentner thinks we could get the first negative headline payrolls figure for this cycle in September.Story continuesIf it were to happen, it would mark a big-time slowdown from the 300,000 average pace of job creation we have gotten year to date.The markets will unlikely take a negative headline jobs number well, Zentner contends. Investor attention may quickly shift to renewed fears of a recession at the hands of an inflation-fighting Federal Reserve.""On a negative payroll print this year, risk-off sentiment in financial markets may soar, especially as investors remain on recession watch despite the strengthening soft-landing story,"" Zentner says.The Fed may not be so quick to act by cutting rates on a drop in jobs, warns Zentner.Another thing investors won't want to hear.Written off surprises for 2023?

The vote was 6-3 in one case against the University of North Carolina, with all three liberal justices dissenting.The decision will have major impacts on universities, which have tried to diversify their student bodies for the past few decades by allowing race to be considered a factor for admission. But the ramifications will go far beyond higher education, and major U.S. companies will also be dramatically affected.Universities are likely to become less diverse over time, directly affecting the talent pool available to American businesses. Experts also say that the court could be receptive in the future to similar cases targeting race-based initiatives at private companies, with no shortage of cases attempting to erode race-based candidate considerations in corporate America.“There are people waiting to take the words of the ruling and bring carry-on cases in a different context,” Debo P. Adegbile, a former member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights who currently chairs the anti-discrimination practice at the law firm WilmerHale, previously told Fortune.We reached out to the Fortune 50 and companies that previously asked the Supreme Court to uphold affirmative action for comment on its decision. Here’s how they responded.Johnson &amp; Johnson“Johnson &amp; Johnson believes a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce and environment enables the delivery of positive business outcomes and cultivates innovation, which benefits the patients we serve. The values of diversity, equity and inclusion have long been part of our culture and are rooted in Our Credo. We hire and advance individuals strictly on merit, based on the skills and competencies most needed by our business now and for the future. We also believe higher education plays a significant role in creating equitable opportunities for individuals to reach their full potential and in developing the diverse talent that corporations need to thrive. We recognize the tremendous value of equitable access to educational opportunities that permit individuals to reach their full potential and we remain steadfast in our commitment to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce and environment.”Story continuesWells Fargo""As a company, we are committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion both inside our company and in the communities where we live and work. We also believe having diverse representation and perspectives, equity, and inclusion across the bank are critical to our ability to serve the evolving needs of our colleagues, customers, and communities.""Microsoft""Microsoft will continue to support legal practices throughout our talent motions that help build diverse workforces, foster innovation and serve business and customer needs. We remain committed to strengthening a culture of inclusion, and it is our hope and expectation that universities and learning institutions remain committed to creating critical skilling opportunities for students of marginalized identities.”General Motors“GM remains committed to fostering a culture that embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion and will continue our work to cultivate a pipeline of talent that reflects our customers and the communities in which we live and work.”AmazonAn Amazon spokesperson said that the company believes in the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion, and remains committed to inspiring and enabling students from underrepresented groups to pursue fulfilling careers at Amazon. They added the company will investigate the potential impact of any legal decisions on their programs and adjust as necessary to comply with the law.Thasunda Brown Duckett, CEO of TIAA“This morning was emotional, but what I do know is that talent is created equally, opportunity is not. And so we will all do our part to make sure that every young talent knows that they can achieve their full potential in this country. We know we still have work to do, but joy comes in the morning.” (Speaking at Essence Fest on June 29)Salesforce“Today’s decision regarding race-conscious admissions is a setback for equality. Our commitment to equality doesn’t waver, and we will continue to work toward our representation goals, regardless of today’s ruling.”Enrique Lores, CEO of HP ""HP prides itself on fostering a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. It has long been a key driver of our success, and we will not waver from these values.""I believe that building a workforce and a workplace that celebrates broader perspectives and experiences is not only the right thing to do, it’s also a business imperative.

The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues have been driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to increase due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth.However, More Personal Computing revenues decreased due to weak Windows and Devices businesses. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. Also, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Alcohol industry over the past year (+4.6% vs. +2.5%). The company has been benefiting from continued business momentum, which resulted in top and bottom-line growth in first-quarter 2023. Further, the company’s relentless execution, investment in brands and accelerated digital transformation aided performance.The top line benefited from strong consumer demand for its portfolio, consistent execution of its strategy and strength of the beer category globally. The expansion of the Beyond Beer portfolio, and investments in B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing bode well. Backed by the continued business momentum, the company outlined its view for 2023.However, shares of AB InBev lagged the industry in the past three months on lower-than-expected earnings in the first quarter.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this call may be recorded. (Operator Instructions).It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson, President and CEO. Please go ahead.John B. GibsonThank you, Stephanie. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended May 31. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'll start with the call today with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year April. We'll review our financial results for fiscal '23 and our outlook for '24. We'll then open it up for your questions. We finished fiscal year '23 with solid financial results and momentum heading into fiscal year 2024. Total revenue grew 9% for the full year, and we hit a major milestone for the company with over $5 billion in total revenue. I was personally reflecting on this last night. When I joined the company, we were just over $2 billion. It took us 6 years to go from $2 billion to $3 billion, 3 years to go to $3 billion to $4 billion, and it took us 3 years to go to $4 billion to $5 billion, but I remind everybody that was during a global pandemic. So certainly, very proud of those results. In addition to that revenue growth at 9%, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $4.27 and operating margins finished at 41% as we continue to benefit from our continued investments in technology, our focus on driving digitalization in all aspects of our business, and our long-standing tradition of operating excellence. These results are due to the hard work and dedication of our more than 16,000 employees. I'm very proud of what we've achieved this fiscal year. Our industry-leading technology and advisory solutions have made a positive impact on our clients and their employees. And in return, they continue to reward us with additional business and a continued loyalty. Momentum in sales has continued with solid growth in new annualized revenue for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. HR Solutions and retirement were areas of particular strength with double-digit growth. We are well positioned in terms of our staffing levels and (inaudible) tenure heading into the new year. Revenue retention finished the year near record levels as we continue to focus on retaining and increasing our share of wallet with our high-value customer segments. Client retention was impacted by higher losses due to out of business concentrated mainly in newly formed businesses in the last 2 years and financial distress in the lower revenue small clients. We continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions with worksite employee growth over 10% year-over-year. Over the year, we achieved record level of worksite employee retention due to our strong and unique value proposition of our leading HR technology and advisory capabilities. Businesses of all sizes continue to navigate the challenges of a very complicated regulatory environment, a competitive labor market and now tightening credit. Demand for our solutions remained strong due to the depth and breadth of our integrated offerings, including HR technology designed to deliver efficiency for both the employer and the employee. Our comprehensive HR outsourcing, which leverages the strength of our technology and the experience of a trained HR professional and our outstanding compliance organization and the need for businesses to offer quality benefits, including retirement to compete for talent. Our retirement solutions are benefiting from the growing expectations of a retirement plan as a core benefit offering for small and midsized businesses. Recent passage of the Secure Act 2.0 legislation and various state mandates requiring employers to provide retirement services to their employees are making 401(k) as a key benefit for small and midsized businesses. With more state mandates expected to take effect in the future, we expect a strong market for retirement to continue for the foreseeable future, and we are well positioned as a leader to take advantage of this opportunity. The SMB credit environment has continued to fuel demand for our employee retention tax credit service. Our full-service ERTC offerings has helped tens of thousands of businesses obtain tax credits and getting access to funds they need to keep their businesses running and growing. We continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects. Industry recognition continues to reinforce the competitive strength of our technology solutions. For the fourth consecutive year, Paychex Flex earned an HR Tech Award for best small and midsized business focused solution in the core HR category. Our consistency in winning these awards and being placed repeatedly in the leadership quadrant of respected technology analyst rankings speaks to our market leadership in HR technology. I'm not only very proud of these results and the performance of the team, but I'm also equally proud of how we achieved these results. We have been consistently recognized as one of the world's most admired, most ethical and most innovative company. In addition, we have been ranked as one of the best places to work for people in sales, for women, for diversity, and for our outstanding training and investment in our employees development. These awards are a testament to how our employees not only get the job done, but do it the right way and we are constantly looking for new ways we can make ourselves and our communities better. As we move into fiscal year '24, we will continue our focus on developing leading customer experiences that combine our technology, our advisory capabilities and our partnerships to deliver superior value to our customers. Paychex is uniquely positioned to help small and midsized businesses navigate the challenges they face in a complex and ever-changing and evolving world. We remain committed to our purpose, and that is to help businesses succeed. And we'll continually strive to have a positive impact on our clients, our employees our communities and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year as well as our guidance for fiscal year '24. Efrain?Story continuesEfrain RiveraThanks, John, and good morning to all of you. I hope you're indoors on this smoking Thursday. I thought we're past it, but not quite. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements refer to the customary disclosures that we make. Let me start by providing a summary of our fourth quarter financial results, talk about full year results and then finish with the review of our fiscal 2024 outlook. Before I start, I also want to add that joining us in the room today this morning, Bob Schrader, VP of Finance and IR. Many of you have met Bob. Okay. For the fourth quarter, you saw total revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion. Management Solutions revenue was up 7%, a little bit over $900 million driven by additional product penetration into our ancillary services, which currently is mostly ERTC and also price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products. Demand for our ERTC service remained strong, as John mentioned, and it contributed approximately 1% to 2% to total revenue growth for the full year. Demand for this service along with our internal execution have continued to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind and we expected demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will become a moderate headwind next year, especially in the back half of the year where it will become more of a headwind. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $300 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees. The rate of growth was tempered a bit by lower medical plan sales and participant volumes along with continued preference for ASO in this environment. We expect these trends will start to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2024, though it won't be evident necessarily in Q1, and I'll talk about that in a little bit. Interest on funds held for clients increased 69% to $25 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates, partially offset by realized losses taken in Q4 as we reposition the portfolio heading into the back half of this year. Total expenses increased 3% to $776 million, expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general cost to support growth in the business. Operating income increased 15% to $453 million, with an operating margin of just under 37%, a 240 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.97, per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% for the quarter to again $0.97 per share. Let me quickly summarize our full year results. Total revenue increased 9% to $5 billion and total service revenue increased 8% to $4.9 billion. As you are all aware, we raised guidance a number of times during the year. Management Solutions increased 8% to $3.7 billion. PEO and Insurance increased 6% to $1.2 billion. Total expenses were up 7% to $3 billion. Operating income increased 10% and with a margin of 40.6%, John mentioned this earlier, as a 70 basis point expansion over the prior year. The leverage in the model as pretty evident. Other income net increased by over $30 million due to higher average interest rates and average investment balances within the corporate investment portfolio. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $4.30 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $4.27 per share. Our financial position remains rock solid with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion and total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of May 2023. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion for the fiscal year, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Driven by higher net income and changes in working capital, free cash flow generated for the year was $1.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year. And while it's easy to glance over those numbers. I think it's really important that when we work to note that when we report numbers, the quality of our earnings and our quality of our cash is very, very strong, as noted by some of you. Not only do we deliver on the top line, but we delivered in a quality way for them on the bottom line, and we intend to continue to do that. We paid out a total of $1.2 billion as dividends during fiscal 2023 or 70% of our net income. Our 12-month rolling return on equity with a stellar 48% with an arrow pointing up. Now let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 2024. Our current outlook, as you saw, is as follows. Management Solutions expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%. We widened that a bit just to accommodate the fact that sometimes attachment on insurance can vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as we saw last year. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million. And then our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. This outlook assumes current macroeconomic environment, which, as you know, has some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes in the economy. We have better visibility in the first half fiscal 2024 as each quarter progresses. We have a little better visibility into the remaining quarters in the year. For the first half of fiscal 2024 and the first quarter, we expect total revenue growth to be approximately 6%. That's the first half and the first quarter. We anticipate operating margins for the first quarter to be approximately 41%. That'll help do a little bit on your modeling. And we expect PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue to be below the low end of the range for the first quarter, then it will be solidly in the range. That's our expectation at this point. Before you ask me the question, I'll answer the first quarter was actually the strongest quarter of the year on PEO last year. And as a consequence, the compare will be a little bit tougher, and we expect the business to build as we go through the year. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, and they can change. We'll update you again on the first quarter call. There's a number of questions because, of course, the time when we give the annual guidance. So if I could just ask for your forbearance on something, which is to say, ask a question and limit yourself to one follow-up. Now I will say I understand some of those questions will be compound questions. But if it's a 5-part compound question, then it violates the rule. But just so we can get through the call without going excessively long. With all of that, I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And I'll turn the call back over to John.John B. GibsonOkay. And now with all the conditions and restrictions that Efrain has laid out for you, we'll now open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.Ramsey Clark El-AssalCan you comment on the pricing environment. You called it out a little bit in the press release. And I guess the question is, are you seeing sort of a window right now for more aggressive pricing adjustments just given the inflationary environment? Or is this sort of -- are you feeling now that you're in sort of a steady state kind of continual trajectory when it comes to pricing?John B. GibsonRamsey, yes, I would say we're more in a steady state. I feel good about where we are. I think the value of our products and services. I think what we see when we talk about price inside our customer base they're rewarding us. They're being the value we're getting. And as we did last year, we believe we have pricing of power inside the base, and we'll continue to avail ourselves of that. And then in terms in new clients and prospects in the competitive environment, hey, we've always been in a competitive market, and I see stable pricing. And I think as we go through this year, we'll continue to do what we need to do to be competitive in the marketplace. So I don't see any major shifts of change on either side of the pricing equation.Ramsey Clark El-AssalOkay. And I wanted to ask also about retention. Obviously, retention at healthy record levels. At the same time, you called out a little bit of where you were seeing a little bit of headwind. I think it was from out of business from newly formed businesses. And I think there was some other color that Efrain provided. If you could just elaborate on that a little bit, I'd appreciate it.John B. GibsonYes, Ramsey. I think it's been pretty consistent. And I think on all the prior calls, I said probably as we expected. So we continue to really focus our efforts on the high-end part of our valuable clients, particularly in HR outsourcing there. We continue to maintain both in the PEO and ASO. Record retention from a revenue and client perspective there. Where we did see -- and we had near record retention overall across the business, again, because of that focus that we're having and the things we're doing from driving value in our high-value customer segments. As we expected, we did see some out of business and then when I pull that back, what you're seeing is exactly what I thought we'd see we had a very high number of new business starts 2 years ago. And almost every model, and I don't care whether we're in a recession, good times or bad times, a business starts and in the first 2 years, about half of them are gone. And so I'm not surprised when we're saying we kind of expected that to be the case, and that's what we saw on kind of the client retention side. But again, even if you look at the client retention side, we're back to where we were pre-pandemic levels. So nothing dramatic there. So I'd say that's more stabilizing, and we kind of expect that kind of more typical, stable kind of client attrition to occur as we're going into '24.OperatorOur next question will come from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Eric Drey] on for Jason. I had a question just kind of high level. We've seen small businesses be really resilient. It kind of seems like the macro may avoid a hard landing. But curious about kind of trends you're seeing among different client groups. Anything to call out, maybe blue collar versus white collar, any color you can add there?John B. GibsonYes. Look, I think, again, not seeing anything, Eric, that out of the norm. I think generally, we've continued to see the hospitality when you go back and look at our jobs index, Hospitality has probably been the laggard. The leisure and hospitality has been the laggard through the course of the recession. What we've seen there is they've really made a good strong comeback, I would say, in the back half of this fiscal year for us and are getting back to what I'm trying to level employment levels of the other segments, not really seeing anything specifically out of the ordinary. Certainly, in the low end of the market, you're seeing a lot more of the small companies go back to what we said on the retention side. Newer start-ups, smaller companies finding more pressure relative to inability to pass price. And so they're being scored by inflation and then also the credit situation.Unidentified AnalystOkay. Great. And then on the -- this one is for Efrain. On the float guidance, kind of 2 parts. What are you thinking about for interest rates? And then what are your thoughts on kind of managing duration? I know the question comes up every call, but thought I'd ask.Efrain RiveraSo what we're thinking and then how we're managing, I'll break those 2. And I mentioned in previous calls that I was really concerned about a sharp decline in rates in first half '24 in the end of this year, calendar year. I don't think that's likely to happen. So at this point, our thinking is that there'll be a couple of rate increases as we go through the first half of the year and likely to see some rate decreases as we enter next year. Certainly, John's comments recently would seem to indicate that's where we're going. But I think -- we think our assumption is that in the first half of calendar year '24 or second half, you're going to see rate decreases. So net-net, that's what's incorporated in our guidance. So while we could adjust and play games in terms of where we are with futures. That's what our thinking is. And as we get through the year, in the back half of the year, we'll update kind of where we're at. So as to position in the portfolio, my bias is to go along as we go through the year to mitigate what in '24 is likely to be a set of rate decreases. I can't call it any closer than that. I think that our numbers kind of support that kind of scenario.OperatorOur next question will come from Rayna Kumar with UBS.Rayna KumarCan you talk about what bookings was? Can you talk a little bit about bookings in the quarter? Anything to call out on different customer sizes and products where you're seeing strength or weaknesses?John B. GibsonYes. So look, we actually saw strong demand continuing, I would say, actually, the -- we actually saw some acceleration in the fourth quarter when you look at it. In the back half of the fiscal year was actually stronger than the first half, which was a public thing, HR services, our HR solutions continue to resonate a retirement. We saw a pickup in the low and digital end of our business in the fourth quarter, which was nice to see. And in fact, I would say the PEO had improvement in Q4 as well, which was an encouraging sign that some of the changes in approach that we've been working on are beginning to get traction. It's early there and the key part of that season is in the first quarter, which leads into the second quarter. But again, very pleased with the strong demand that we saw across the platform. So I think we've got a good set of products and services. There's strong demand in this environment across all the market that we're in.Rayna KumarGot it. It's very helpful. And then just a quick -- really quick follow-up to stay within Efrain's guidelines here. Could you call out the ERTC contribution just for the fourth quarter?Efrain RiveraNo, we didn't. I think, Rayna, we're going to stick with it 1% to 2% on growth for the full year. So -- and then that converts from a tailwind into a headwind next year. That's as far as we go.OperatorOur next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.Andrew Owen NicholasI was going to ask first on kind of M&amp;A within Paychex. If you could just kind of give us an update on your ambitions, both in the near term and medium term? This is definitely a compound question, but a preference between ACM and PEO and anything you could say on valuations?John B. GibsonYes. Andrew, thanks for the question. Our ambitions remain the same. We're trying to find opportunities that meet our strategic objectives. And at the same time, make sense financially. The latter has been more challenging in the environment, I would say, over the past few years, but I think we certainly begin to see some change in the market dynamics and our pipeline you're beginning to expand with opportunities that I think are more realistic for us to consider. I don't think our focus has really changed. We're going to continue to look for tuck-ins that help us kind of add scale in new markets or expand our product suite. We're looking for capability enhancements, particularly in the digital area, digital capabilities, data, data analytics, HR analytics. And again, we're constantly looking at numerous adjacencies as the market continues to evolve and looking for new growth platforms that are adjacent to our current suite of solutions and really help us continue to deliver that value proposition to small and medium-sized businesses to help them succeed. So again, tuck-ins, capability enhancements and new growth platforms that's our areas of focus, and we're going to continue to be mindful of making sure we're getting good deals and not as a pain.Andrew Owen NicholasThat's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to ask on kind of the margin guide for next year. I think last quarter, you spoke to a preliminary target of 25 to 50 basis points. I think the 41% to 42% range you put out this morning is a decent bit higher at the midpoint. So if you could just kind of unpack that a little bit, what's changed in terms of your outlook, if anything, or if it's just a matter of rounded numbers, and that's totally fine as well. Just trying to get a little bit more insight there.Efrain RiveraYes. I guess I'd answer that in a couple of ways. Look, March is preliminary, I mean that we haven't gone to a plan I think that John continue to tradition that we've had in the company, which is to say where can we find sources of leverage in the P&amp;L. So obviously, mix has an impact on that, Andrew. As you're aware, you have more you have opportunity and more management solutions that gives you more opportunity. But I would say we went through a pretty disciplined process in the planning process to see where there were opportunities for leverage and cover them and that's what you're seeing in the guidance. I'd say one other thing that's really important. The process of planning a year is a 365-day activity. If we get through the first quarter as we go through, we see opportunities both on the investment side and also on the cost side, we go for it, and we challenge ourselves to find those opportunities. So I think that in addition to the fact that, that was a byproduct that we're not byproduct, but a theme of the planning process, we think in those terms. And so because you have to go into the year with multiple levers to find leverage if you need it. So we're -- as we speak, thinking about, okay, how can we even do better or offset any potential issues that might come up in the year. So it's that. There's a little bit around a little bit of planning and a little bit of D&amp;A.OperatorOur next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.Kevin Damien McVeighI'll just have one to make up some time. Efrain, you talked a little bit about, I think, kind of revenue retention versus client retention and revenue retention being at all-time high despite kind of, I think, a little shift in client. Can you help us frame what the delta is there, kind of what it is today and kind of where that's been historically? And I'd imagine it's probably narrowed over time, but is there any way to frame that a little bit more?Efrain RiveraYes, yes. So look, it was approaching the mid-80s during the pandemic, but that really is in some ways kind of an outlier. When we reported last year, it's kind of like 1 year post the midpoint of the pandemic -- I'm sorry, the pandemic, it was between 83% and 84% and this year, we're between 82% and 83%. So as John mentioned, we saw some larger losses on the low end of the market. I'll frame that in one second. That 82%, 83% is consistent with where we've been in prior years. There's nothing unusual about that. What was unusual during the pandemic was that the number of bankruptcies, what we call involuntary losses will be much lower than it normally has been. And there's obvious reasons I don't even tell everyone on the call about PPP. So a lot of those clients kind of got through the client base to John's point, what was going on was that we had a pent-up group of very small clients that were being propped up a bit by funding. In some ways, the losses were higher because of that. And I think we're now back to more normalized environment in terms of losses. But I want to make an important point and John referenced it. We put a lot of emphasis on revenue retention, especially among high-value clients and what's not different or what is different in pandemic is that our revenue retention is higher than it was pre-pandemic. So we're at record retention levels from revenue. That's where we've put a lot of our focus on, and I can -- I won't do it but we could cite many, many efforts that go into retaining our highest clients so we can deliver approximately 88% revenue retention. That's important. That's an important number for us. And so while in the past, we talk a lot about unit retention, nothing wrong with that. You want that. The reality is that what's become much more important is that you save and you retain your highest value clients. And so while on -- while our unit retention is in line with what it was pre-pandemic our revenue retention was higher and it has remained higher and will be an area of focus going forward.John B. GibsonKevin, the thing I would add to that, I want like to remind everybody is I go back and -- we go back and look at this over the last 4 to 5 years. When we say pre-pandemic levels, you go back to '19 and if you read our transcript, what you would also hear in '19 is that on a client retention, we were aligned, we actually had historical high client retention back in '19 as well. So we are returning on the client side to levels that historically for Paychex would have been historical high in terms of client retention. And then as Efrain pointed out, we've had a lot of focus on what we need to do to drive better retention in our high-value segments, and we've been very successful to do that. And I think coming out of the pandemic, the value that we've demonstrated to those clients in terms of both our technology enhancements as well as the advisory support that we've given them through very challenging times. I think they've rewarded us. They reward this by buying more from us, they've rewarded us by giving us the opportunity to have a better pricing for those products and services because they see the value and they reward this with their loyalty.OperatorOur next question will come from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.Bryan C. BerginI wanted to dig into management solutions here a bit more and maybe some of the underlying growth driver assumptions for '24. When we look here, just this year, in '23, I see total company client growth of like 1.5 points in '23, and you're citing increased product penetration and price realization, can you kind of roll that forward for us here? Can you give us a sense on how you're thinking about the pieces here across the client growth versus pricing versus product attached?Efrain RiveraYes. Yes. I would say, Bryan, 2 things is that we have said that typical client growth in a year, it's going to be in the 1% to 3% range. We were on the low end of that range. We expect to be middle or higher next year. So that's part of the equation. On the pricing side, we're typically in the 2% to 4% range, although recent years, higher than that. We're on the mid to maybe perhaps a little bit higher than mid-level on the pricing side. Those are sort of the basic elements and then you got mix and additional product penetration driving the remainder of that. Now if you start reconciling I got to take the negatives, too. And the negative is I'm going to get some headwind from ERTC, which you will see in on the management solution side. So that's when you triangulate all those pieces, that's where you get to a 5% to 6% growth.Bryan C. BerginOkay. How about client employment there, so and I guess specifically in 4Q, how do it occur in 3Q, and then for 24 as well?Efrain RiveraSorry, I started talking on the (inaudible). You were saying in Q3 and then Q4, what you were saying it.Bryan C. BerginYes. So as you think about client employment, I'm curious about how you're factoring that for '24. But also, I think you guys were assuming 4Q was going to be relatively flattish from 3Q. Did that play out? Or was that different, too?Efrain RiveraYes. Yes, that played out. And going into next year, we expect to be flattish. I will say that. I mean, you always have to have an element of caution on the impact of higher rates. I mean -- they -- there are levels there that would cause me to get a little bit more concerned than I am right now. So we'll have to play that out. And that definitely would have an impact on worksite employee growth. I think it's manageable. We've taken that into account in our plan. But at this point, we're not expecting that is going to change as we go into next year.OperatorOur next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche BankBryan Connell KeaneI just wanted to follow up on the client growth question. It sounds like you expect it to go up a little bit higher than it was. It was on the low end of the range and then it will go up. Is that a function of what you're seeing in the sales channel? Or is that a little bit of retention, just given that maybe some of the smaller clients that churned off during the pandemic, you won't have that same issue as you go into this yearEfrain RiveraYes, Bryan, 2 answers to that is, and John mentioned that generally don't go into this level of detail. But we saw a pretty strong unit growth as we -- in the back half of the year. So it wasn't a sales-driven issue is really more of a retention-driven issue based on the factors that we talked about earlier in the call, i.e. just to go one level deeper, we all remember that one of the anomalies in the pandemic was that the business starts really, really accelerated. And I think to this day, (inaudible) completely explain it. And so we benefited from that unit growth. But as John said, we know a number of those clients are going to go out of business. And after 2 years, we did the analysis that we all looked at and a lot of those clients did not survive once the PPP and other government stimulus moving out of business. I'm sorry, once that stimulus was gone. So that's primarily a driver somewhat of an normal situation. I think that we'll return to more traditional patterns as we get into next year. That's our expectation.Bryan Connell KeaneGot it. And the guidance looks pretty consistent as you look at the revenue and the margins, you're not wildly off from the first half of the second half and sometimes there's bigger changes there. Any kind of key macro factors that you watch that we should be watching that could move it up or down that could change, at least maybe as we get into the second half as we think about the macro?Efrain RiveraYes. I'll let John talk about it, too. But what I'd say, Bryan, is, look, everyone on the call was worried about a crash landing that will move through '23. And look, I mean, there was skepticism in the market as to whether we are going to be able to hit our numbers. We had some conversations with investors. I assured them with one thing that continues to be the factor that -- or the environment that we're seeing now, we're not seeing dramatic changes in the environment, and we would start to see them and exercise the appropriate level of caution that we did. So we're going to look at what's the impact of these interest rates at this point. Small businesses seems to be absorbing them. They seem to be getting what they need to be able to fund their businesses. We don't think that will last forever. There are rates at which it's going to prove to be difficult. I would say what's happening on the macro is really important. The internal stuff, we can manage that. We will manage that. And as I said, too many people that look we have to pivot inside the base. There's a lot of opportunity inside the base. We'll pivot inside the base if the external environment doesn't give us opportunities for growth. John, do you want to add anything?John B. GibsonYes. No, I think the other thing that I think to keep in mind a little bit about the macro. Again, we'll go back to the macro side. I look at our small business index, I look at the start of this calendar year, we went the first 3 months, the index actually went up every month. So it went up for 3 consecutive months, and then it sort of stabilized, so we continue to see that. As Efrain said, we probably expected in the fourth quarter, and we're always kind of sitting here waiting for employment to go down in it, and in it. So actually, I would say, I was actually a little pleasantly surprised at where we were on checks and where we were on worksite employee growth inside the base of clients that we have. So continuing to see that hiring is also an issue and staffing continues to be an issue of our HR concern. So we look at what are the questions and issues that are coming into our HR consultants. We continue to see that to be an issue. And I do think you're going to see something interesting here that we've probably not seen. Small and midsized business owners are scarred by their experience of employment over the last several years and they thought to get back to staffing levels. And I think what's going to be interesting is they're going to be very hesitant to let go because I think they remember what it was like trying to find talent. And they're just simply not enough labor supply here. So I think it's going to be very interesting who kind of wins this tug of war back and forth relative to employment. The other thing that we see is we're seeing a lot of nontraditional labor being tapped by businesses, big workers, contract workers, maybe a little bit more part time. What I'm curious about to see or will those be the first things to go, that before a small business owners going to let go permanent staffing that they've got, that they're paying every week, are they going to try to write it out by tightening in other areas such as this nontraditional gig employment that's kind of sprung up. So the labor market is a very, very interesting thing, I think, for us to look at and study right now. And I don't think it sets up for traditional recessionary models that people have built. So that's just my pontification based upon my conversations with what we're hearing from clients and what we see in our data.OperatorOur next question will come from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.Scott Darren WurtzelJust on the expense side, I wanted to see if you guys can just go over maybe what some of your top investment priorities are over the next 12 months and sort of folding into that how you're thinking about maybe incorporating generative AI into your business as well?John B. GibsonYes. So the investments are in growth, in growth. Those are probably the top 2. And then you mentioned digital. I mean we've been making a lot of investments in the digital area, both in terms of our sales and what we're doing from a go-to-market perspective, which we're very happy with and how we're leveraging technology, AI in the back office. And I'm very pleased with several things that we've got going on. So we've been actively leveraging AI for several years across every area of the business, driving efficiency, delivering a lot of our large clients. And one of the things I keep telling people was we're one of the few players in this industry to have the size of the data set that we have. And I do think in these type of an AI, you've got to have a large data set. We're using it in customer service. We're using it in the risk. We're using it in finance. We're using it in our HR outsourcing advisory capacity. We're building it into our products, in our retention insights products. So there's a lot of investment that we're making and a lot of learnings that we have in terms of how we can digitize the front office and the front of house and kind of the back office of our business. And so that's going to be an area that we continue to invest and continue to explore.Scott Darren WurtzelGot it. It's very helpful. And then, Efrain, just a quick clarification on the float income side with the guidance. So I'm wondering if you could maybe help us out with how you're thinking about client balance growth for the year?Efrain RiveraClient balance growth, roughly in line with wage inflation, which is to say, most of the business.OperatorOur next question will come from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.Efrain RiveraAre you battling the smoke there in Cleveland, too?Kartik MehtaYesterday was a lot worse than it is today. So it's a little bit better today, but thank you for asking, Efrain. I'm wondering just on paper control, Efrain, I know they've come down obviously from pretty high levels. And I'm wondering if -- what your expectations are for FY '24, not only for the payroll business, but also the PEO and if you're seeing anything different?Efrain RiveraYes, 2 good questions. So flattish, I guess, is the short answer to what we expect for '24. Don't expect too much in terms of in client-based growth, and that's a mix. I think our larger clients are doing fine and in some cases, adding employees who look at it. Smaller, smaller clients, less so and then you got to factor in what your interstate losses are. So you always tend to move a little bit higher than what you gain in a given year, and then you expect your in-clients, the base to grow the work on employed. But this is an environment where I don't think it's going to be robust. In terms of hiring in part as to what John said earlier, which is that many businesses would like to hire that just as they weren't the people who were there -- were available and also figured out how to do it without people, but they probably will be, as John mentioned, less inclined to perhaps get rid of them. On the PEO, and I'd say also the ASO side, our worksite employee, we have worksite employ growth. This year, we expect that to continue into next year. You could see solid worksite employee growth as we rebound going into next year. But overall, and I think that Bryan asked these questions, it's not going to be a significant driver of revenue growth. Perhaps in PEO, but not on the HCM side.Kartik MehtaAnd then just one follow-up. John, I'd be interested in your thoughts on kind of job openings. We see all these numbers, [Joe's] numbers, but it seems like employers have become cautious. So just your perspective on what you really think job openings are as you look at your customers versus maybe what we see in the news?John B. GibsonYes, Kartik. Go back to what I said before. We continue to have clients that are wanting to fill open positions and I don't -- I'm not seeing that change. I would say that they're being more successful in filling those positions. So we've certainly seen that, and we've seen some recovery. I mentioned regional hospitality in particular, which was well behind and had good recovery in the back half of our fiscal year here. I do think relative to not maybe opening up as many positions, I would also tell you that one of the things that I think did happen is when we were in the great resignation, which was probably 18 months ago. It seems like forever now, but really only 18 months ago. Pretty much a lot of business owners were thinking every position I have needs to be posted because I've got to assume that I'm going to potentially lose those positions. So I think there was a lot of postings for jobs that people were passively looking for. And I think some of the contraction that we've seen in the postings are more business owners being a little more disciplined about what am I actually going to hire and being out in the market and focused on that. I don't know if that makes sense or helps you.Kartik MehtaIt does. Thank you both. I fully appreciate it.John B. GibsonI may add that those individuals who are using our onboarding and recruiting experience in Flex are realizing about a 20% improvement in their time to higher. So just if there's any customers or prospects on the phone.OperatorOur next question will come from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson.Eugene M. SimuniI wanted to ask a question about the PEO. So kind of we expected kind of the deceleration here. And you highlighted again insurance, health care insurance attach rates as one of the drivers. So was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on that, kind of where are you seeing softness in health care insurance attached? What kind of businesses, I think that will be helpful to hear just because there's so much variability about around, I feel like the PEO industry in terms of this health care insurance rate attach. And it would be helpful to hear specifically in your client base what you're seeing? And then related to that, as we are looking for the reacceleration in the PEO and as you're kind of guiding to that, what gives you confidence that this -- there will be a pivot there over the next 12 months?Efrain RiveraEugene, let me start and then John will provide additional comments. With us, it's less about verticals, although I'll caveat that with a second. It's really more about where we derive revenue on the health care side that flows through the P&amp;L, and that's the state of Florida. So for us, on the PEO health care as it relates to revenue, really, it's the Florida game primarily. And the anomaly -- and when you talk about Florida, you know immediately that you're going to over index on leisure and hospitality. So a bit of what's going on is it depends on what new clients coming into the base are and whether customers and leader in hospitality are really interested in offering health care clients, a number of them do. And that's not all clients in Florida to be fair, that's probably too much of a generalization. But there was more of a regional issue than it was, I'd say, as it affected revenue than it was something else. So why do we feel more comfortable? Because we have put a tremendous amount of focus on it. And that's not to say that guarantee success, but I would say, as we saw what was going on, we took a lot of measures to improve that aren't going to necessarily again be evident in the first quarter but should be evident beyond that. And there were things in which we've talked about in prior calls. I will repeat, there were some anomalous that we saw people actually in the PEO decided they didn't want health care insurance. We thought our hypothesis was that they were feeling some pressure from a wage perspective and perhaps despite of that from a total compensation perspective, they were not going to offer health care. But we've taken a number of actions that we think will create better momentum going into next year. I'll let John talk about that -- talk about that issue.John B. GibsonYes. No, not much to add, Eugene. I do think it's important to understand on the insurance component, there was a trend that we saw happened not just in the field, but also in our insurance agencies. In the health and benefits area, which it's not just the client. There's 2 decision points here. One is the client deciding they're going to offer benefits. And second is an employee deciding they're going to enroll and play their fair share. And we saw in both cases that the clients, particularly clients, less clients were adding an insurance. That's one part of it, right? You certainly can go and try and get someone to switch from their existing insurance. We saw less people adding insured health insurance as an option. And then when you look inside, when we went through our normal enrollment period, we found that less of the employees that were offered insurance elected to sign up for it. And so all the things Efrain just said, we saw that happen in both areas. That caused us to go back and what you can do is you can go back and look at your plan designs, you can look at leaner plans, you can look at different plans, all of those things. We went through an exhaustive review of every one of our core PO markets to look at every one of our plan designs and look at every one of our offerings to make sure we have the broadest suite. Now those decisions are made. We're actively out in the market selling clients on those today. Those will go in, in the July time frame, if you will. And remember, our enrollment for PO begins in that July time frame, it really goes through the January time frame. So you won't see kind of that pickup of that going on. So we look at every aspect of it. We've made some modifications and changes where we think it makes sense. We know that the HR outsourcing value proposition is still strong because it's growing at 10%, and we saw strong demand in the second half of the year. We know that the PO value proposition is strong because of our record retention and the clients that can't afford it and have it are doing well. So we have reason to believe there was some early signs, as I said earlier, in the fourth quarter of improvement there. And now we're getting into the heart of it, and we'll see that kind of build as we go into the second, third and fourth quarter of this coming fiscal year. So again, we got -- we feel confident that we have the right plans in place and now we'll go out and execute that in the marketplace and see how it goes.Eugene M. SimuniGot it. Super helpful. And then a quick follow-up on some of the comments you made earlier on retention bookings and client growth to title together. So when we're thinking about your guidance for next fiscal year and Efrain, you mentioned that you expect client growth to pick up from the kind of 1.5% level with so this year, would that be a result of both improved retention and improved sales? Or is it primarily one or the other that will drive the improvement in client growth?Efrain RiveraNo, you got to do both. I mean, we're relying on one -- long story short, both sides of that equation have pretty powerful incentives to make sure that they occur. You hit it 100%, sometimes you hit it more. But you've got to get both sides to work to get the right net client gain number.John B. GibsonYes, and I'll add on to that. Again, I would say the second half was stronger than the first half from a sales unit perspective. And if you dig under our retention numbers first half to second half, our controllable losses improved in the second half. So again, what we can control. And I do believe that there's a degree of what I call flushing out of the bankruptcies from 2 years ago in terms of us looking at clients that are kind of on the financial edge and whether or not we want to continue to -- or feel confident we can continue to do business with them. Those type of things are kind of flushed out of the system. We've been investing a lot in what we can do to control what we can control regardless of the environment. We talked about AI. We've been deploying a lot of very sophisticated AI models inside our service organization and inside our client base that are giving us very strong indications of where we may have a client and risk and we're demonstrating success and demonstrate success in the back half of the year of being able to intercept those and turn those situations in the positive retention story. So when I look at the retention story and the sales story first half, back half of last fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making there.OperatorOur next question will come from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup.Peter Corwin ChristiansenEfrain, I was curious about the portfolio repositioning and I know it wasn't too large, but should we expect, I guess, future maybe operating outperformance to be reinvested for portfolio repositioning, maybe layering into rates faster? And then as a follow-up to that, maybe looking at prior cycles, is there a relationship between interest rates and competitive pricing? I would imagine this float income becomes more a bigger part of the business model that gives more leeway for competitors to be more aggressive on the pricing side. Any comments there would be helpful.Efrain RiveraThose are 2 absolutely fantastic questions. Literally, I mean, wow. Okay. So let me take one. Part of what you do, part of what you work with the team is to understand what you need to deliver and understand what your degrees of freedom in delivering them are. When you perform at a certain level, you have more degrees of freedom, not surprising. So it's all my colleague CFOs out there, who struggle sometimes because they don't have the degrees of freedom, I feel you. When you do have the opportunity to reposition because performance gives you that option. You look at it and you figure out, we're pretty disciplined here is the NPV of doing that better than the NPV of not doing that. And so in the fourth quarter, we thought there was a positive NPV to that approach. Would we do it in the future? I'd have to see. There's other (inaudible) issues that come into play, which is how much -- what do you want your max duration to be and are you picking the right time. You never get it right. because we're trying to predict other behaviors, but I think that we've done a good job. To your point, this is really kind of the interesting question that we're wrestling with. So we don't know. I can give you a sense of what happens when interest rates get to 6%. I know because I studied that pretty extensively when I came into the job now 12 years ago. And 2 things you got to worry about or be concerned about there. Number 1 is that you can attempt to be pretty aggressive on pricing in that kind of environment. So the interest rates are high. You can take it as a signal the price high. But what I find at least in our history was when you did that, when you get that overly aggressive in pricing in '07, '08, you're going to pay a price on retention. It just is -- it follows. And at least that's a conviction that I have. Now maybe you leave some money on the table by not pricing even more aggressively. But I think that there's a balancing that there for clients because you're trying to create a level of trust in terms of the value that you delivered to them, and there is a tipping point at which that level of trust gets breached. So we need to look at that closely. The second part is as interest rates are now creeping up, if they were to go over 6%, now that starts to become a threshold where it becomes more difficult for small businesses and many medium-sized businesses to operate from a financing perspective. They got to look for other options. That's one thing, by the way, that we're looking at very closely, how do we help clients. ERTC was a great example of how we did that this year. That's why we think it did so well within the base. But you got to play those 2 elements off each other in determining what the price and how to help the clients navigate to an environment where interest rates are high. So hopefully, that answers your question.Peter Corwin ChristiansenYes, it certainly does. The balance, yes, that's certainly a challenge. I'd imagine. I don't envy you, but thanks for the insight. Very helpful.OperatorOur next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.Tien-Tsin HuangJohn, Efrain, I just want to ask on PEO. Again, I know it's growing in line with peers in the quarter here. You're looking for some acceleration. You talked through that with Eugene. How much of the acceleration again, just to simplify it is coming from volume versus rate versus mix? Just want to make sure I understand the components.Efrain RiveraWell, I'll take that, Tien-tsin. So look, I want to kind of clarify something to start, which is that we have worked on employee growth in the PEO. It's not as though we contracted in that area. We think we're off to a pretty strong start actually in terms of at least our bookings activity. But we expect relative to last year for health care attachment to be higher than it was, the contribution from health care that will be higher than it was last year. We just couldn't hit the numbers that we had last year, but we had also seen simultaneously that the base business in admin was going down. This is very difficult, challenging. So we expect growth in the business, growth in client. We expect growth in attachment that's really kind of driving the at least less so, Tien-Tsin. I think that's less of an issue. Typically, just to remind everyone our PEO points are typically upper 20s to low 30s in terms of clients. We're not trying to go down stream necessarily, but it's really going to come from more clients better help to attach.John B. GibsonAnd we're just really not expecting any type of major pricing increases either on the health side or on the general and administrative fee side. I mean it's going to be well within our normal course. Although I would mention that on the health care side, our normal course is in the single digits, which far beeps on a historical basis, what health care inflation is. So that's a benefit and a retention benefit for our clients. The other thing I probably, we haven't talked about that we have a thesis around is that we had very good HR outsourcing growth. And one of the things that we saw because of the insurance anomaly was a tilt towards our ASO product. And so when you look on the aggregate, we have a very, very solid year. Our HR outsourcing offerings, ASO and the managed service side and PEO, but we tilted towards one versus the other. We're actually -- we actually -- I look at that now and say, wait a minute, I now have more clients that love our technology, love our (inaudible) -- and now it's just a matter of finding the right health care solution going back and upselling them into the POS. We have a pretty concentrated efforts on that. Actually, that's another area where we're using AI, where we are actually analyzing the deduction fees from existing payroll and ASO customers so that we can triangulate what we think they are currently paying for health care. And then using the demographic data that we have to do some AI-based underwriting to give us a computer-based targeted list of clients that we can approach with a really almost prepackaged value proposition that says, ""Hey, we think we can help you save money on your insurance if you join our PO, you're already an ASO client of ours."" So we're just getting -- we've been working on that model for 9 months as part of our efforts. And that's an area, too, that we think there's opportunity inside our base to go back with our new insurance value proposition in the PO and see if we can't move some clients over.Tien-Tsin HuangGood. And that's the beauty of Paychex having both ASO and PEO. So I guess as my follow-up, any change in your appetite on the whole self-insured versus the fully guaranteed PEO model to the extent that you can better maybe control the insurance packages? And I know Efrain is probably thinking I'm trying to trick you guys to answer the consolidation question, but I'll ask it too. So right appetite to do acquisitions on the PEO side, I know it's been, what, 5 years since you did Oasis. You said tuck-ins, but I know there's been some news in the market around consolidation or I know that probably is a multiplied question, so I'm on the bad guys there.Efrain RiveraLet me answer the first one. I get that question and I think investors are sensitive to the level of balance sheet risk. So when we originally did this a number of years ago, I said I don't want to be reporting quarters when we blow up the balance sheet because we were doing the wrong things on the insurance side. I don't think (inaudible). What I mean by that is just taking excessive risk. So everyone knows what they get when they invest in the company, we have managed that without any hiccup because 2 things help us. One is that even though we go at risk, we don't make money. We make a little money on health care insurance and that removes the incentive to necessarily push insurance, chief insurances away selling PEO. That's a fool's game. We don't play it. We'll never play it. Having said that, as we get to a certain density in markets and many of the people in the core mill, what the big markets are. When we look at that, we evaluate whether going at risk and insurance in a market won't make sense. I won't forestall that we would not, but it will be subject to the same type criteria. And the other part is that the reason for doing it would not be necessarily to increase revenue, but for us to capture share in that market. So nothing imminent, but that's our thought process. I think we've got of a track record in terms of managing it in an appropriate way. I'll let John talk to PEO and M&amp;A.John B. GibsonYes. Just to add to that, I don't think that our current approach to insurance in the PO was a driver to what we saw last year. And so I don't think taking more risk is necessarily the solution I think that our current approach has demonstrated that we can grow at industry rates without exposing ourselves to additional risk. And so to Efrain's point, I don't see that as a magic bullet. I don't think you need that to grow the PO value proposition to Efrain's point, to the degree in which we thought it could accelerate growth in some way and the risk to be balanced, it's something to consider, but not something that we're looking at. I mean I think in terms of the PEO M&amp;A front, we haven't done much in 5 years. It's obviously a very attractive industry for private equities to pay very high multiples for which for my opinion, not much capability. When we made the acquisition of Oasis, we were looking at both getting significant scale in the PEO and capability, we got that with Oasis. We were typically a smaller kind of regional PEO, not, and we knew we needed to national scale to get there. We're now the top player in the industry. So I think what we would be looking for is tuck-ins in markets where that makes sense. If we were going to add a capability, right, but a capability in terms of something different in the PEO, that's interesting, but again, what I continue to see is we're involved and know about almost every deal in the industry, I still think the multiples are a little high for what they would bring value, and we have enough organic and inside the base opportunity for us to continue to invest our dollars in.OperatorOur next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.James Eugene FaucetteJust a couple of quick follow-ups for me. On the out-of-business commentary, I understand kind of the conditions there where you maybe were below normal during the height of the pandemic, and that's normalizing. I'm just wondering if right now you would characterize that out of business run rate as being more elevated still? Or does it kind of come back more into line with what you would expect to be kind of normal?John B. GibsonIt's back to normal. And again, I go back to say it's back to normal pre-pandemic '19, which, again, were at reasonably historically low levels for us if you went back historically before that. So look, there was a big surge in new business starts right at the start of the pandemic, and we knew in our models whether or not there was a recession, whether or not interest rates were 1% or 6%. Those businesses, a fair number, then we're not going to survive after 2 years. And so we didn't know whenever is going to come, but I think we knew it was going to come. I think we've seen that begin to flesh through. We've kind of returned back to what I would say are more normal business start levels. And again, business starts are still reasonably solid. We're not seeing a different business starts again. There was a big spike. We're now back to where we were kind of pre-pandemic, which again were very, very solid and conducive numbers for growth in our business before the pandemic.James Eugene FaucetteYes. Yes. No, that makes sense. I appreciate that. And then just a quick question to make sure that we're thinking about business sensitivities correctly. If we were to see macro deteriorate further, which of the underlying vertical, whether it be payroll, HCM software, retirement, ASO management solutions would be hit hardest versus what would be most resilient? I think we have some ideas there, but I just want to make sure we're thinking about that correctly.Efrain RiveraYes. I'd say -- so you got 2 points of comparison kind of what happened in 2007 and 2008 and then what happened during the pandemic. What we saw again the pandemic was that -- on the PEO side, PEO, our base, at least, a PEO client-shed employees more quickly. It was -- I was surprised by the speed with which they did it. I think you'd see more of an impact there on the PEO if you saw more of a sharp downturn. A garden variety of softness? Probably not. And then second, James, it will see but if we go back certainly to the pandemic, you saw employers start to shed clients -- shed employees, I should say, shed employees interestingly enough, or it was a little bit anomalous during the pandemic, but we didn't see huge client losses, but we did see them drop employees. And so then you see that impact. I'd remind everyone that our model is not a pure people model. It's subscription plus people. And so we have some insulation in the event that there's a downturn in overall employment levels fall. And finally, last caveat, we do have the ability to pivot in the base, which we did during the pandemic, which helped to mitigate the impact of what was going on in the economy as a whole.John B. GibsonYes. And I would probably say we're actually more effective in terms of both our capabilities analytically to be able to target inside the base, our capabilities from the sales and marketing and digital perspective inside the base than we were in any of the -- in the prior downturn. I mean, we just have gotten very, very effective in driving product penetration and identifying opportunities within our client base where we can add additional value with a pretty broad set of products and services.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Andre Childress] on for Mark. So I'll just leave that one. Retirement Solutions continues to see strong growth and clearly had some nice tailwinds. Can you talk about some of the measures you are taking to capitalize on the opportunity provided by both the Secure Act as well as state mandates?John B. GibsonYes. So as you know, we're a leader in small and midsized businesses in terms of the number of plans. We manage more retirement plans than any other company. For the 12th straight year, we actually have prepared to support businesses, more businesses than any other provider. So we are actively already educating our existing customers and have a variety of digital marketing programs in the market. I think you'll continue to see a more aggressive positioning of Paychex in the 401(k). We're looking at how it can play a bigger role in our bundles and all of our payroll bundles as well. Because, again, what we're finding is given both the state mandate, coupled with the Secure Act 2.0, where literally, if you're a company gets up 20 employees, and we're working on trying to make some changes to that legislation to actually drop it down even lower than that. We can start up a 401(k) plan and basically at no cost to you. And you can then provide up to a $1,000 of match to your employees and get that money back as well. So when you -- this is like one of the ERTC moments where our value proposition we can go to a small business owner and say, you can have a valuable benefit that's going to help you retain your employees, help you attract employees and really for -- it's not going to cost you anything to get it started. We think there's a powerful value proposition. And like I said, we're already the largest -- we already know how to do this. We already have the sales and marketing capabilities and the operational capabilities to do this in a very efficient and effective way. So we're going to continue to capitalize on this as we go into the fiscal year.OperatorOur final question will come from Samad Samana with Jefferies.Samad Saleem SamanaGreat. So I just wanted to ask on maybe your own sales organization. Can you help us think through just between the last couple of years being strong and then us entering, let's say, a slightly different environment maybe looking forward, how maybe the sales organization performed versus quota in fiscal '23? And maybe what assumptions around quota you're thinking for fiscal '24 in terms of the quota increases for your sales organization?John B. GibsonWell, as I said, we were very pleased with the record-setting year that we had in sales execution. It really was a stellar year from a sales performance perspective. My hat's off to the entire team. And as I said, the back half was stronger than the front half. And given that momentum we have coming out of there, the investments we've made in the fourth quarter in terms of marketing, also a lot of work on what I would say is go-to-market support for our sales teams, the things we're doing relative to sales training and sales effectiveness tools that we invested in, in the fourth quarter, given the momentum we've seen our sales team has readily and happily accepted higher quotas for fiscal year '24.Samad Saleem SamanaAppreciate that. Efrain, I'd love to ask you another PEO follow-up question, but I'll just save that for -- I'm joking. I'm going to give you that one question. You guys have a great day.OperatorThere are no additional questions at this time. I would like to now turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.John B. GibsonOkay. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for being with us today. I know probably many of you are starting ahead or headed or about to head to the 4th of July weekend. Hope you have a great time with your family. I want to thank you for your questions and support. I want to reflect again on this past fiscal year. Certainly, a transition year for me coming in into my new position as CEO, an absolutely phenomenal year for the company. The employees did a great job navigating a very complex fiscal year. And for the company to achieve that $5 billion milestone is really a testament to their hard work and to do it at the speed we did it during the global pandemic is something to say. I was reflecting last night as I was looking back over the last 5-year results across the board, and I go back and anchor myself to fiscal year '19 which is hard to remember, that was before the pandemic. And I looked at our fourth quarter, and I looked at our full year statistics. And when you go down there and see we had better revenue growth, better profit growth, better retention metrics, better HR outsourcing metrics that are new sales revenues, better new sales unit rates of growth in the fourth quarter of this past fiscal year and the full year than we had in fiscal year '19. We not only weathered the pandemic but I think we actually came out of the pandemic in a stronger position across the board. And I just want to thank the 16,000 employees at Paychex for making that happen. Hope you all have a very nice 4th of July weekend. Thank you very much. Have a great day.OperatorThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

President and Fellows of Harvard, and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented in both cases, with Jackson, a Harvard Law alumna, having recused from voting on the case involving the college.Dozens of major corporations across various industries took interest in the case, including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), General Motors (GM), General Dynamics (GD), Dell, and Starbucks (SBUX).Those companies and nearly 40 others joined in an amicus brief contending that diversity in higher education ultimately helps their businesses by providing a diverse pool from which they can recruit.The supporters went on to argue that doing away with the policy would also weaken the military’s pool of eligible college-trained recruits.The Supreme Court in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The decisions overhaul a string of Supreme Court cases that address the role of race in institutionalized education, starting with the high court’s landmark 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. In Brown the court outlawed race-based segregation in public schools.The court acknowledged that its prior rulings permitted race-based admissions, saying it did so only ""within the confines of narrow restrictions.""University programs, the court said, must comply with strict scrutiny — the highest standard of review applied to constitutional questions. In writing for the majority, Roberts said the universities therefore ""may never use race as a stereotype or negative, and — at some point — they must end.""Story continuesThe challenger in both cases, Students for Fair Admissions, argued that affirmative action is illegal in public and private college settings because it penalizes equally qualified Asian-American and other minority applicants.The group, led by conservative activist Edward Blum, claimed that UNC’s consideration of race violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which bars government entities and public universities from discriminating based on race.Students walk through Harvard Yard on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)In its case against Harvard, a private university, the organization claimed that the school’s admissions policy violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bars race-based discrimination by organizations that take federal funds.Specifically, Students for Fair Admissions asked the court overturn its 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger, which held the University of Michigan's Law School could consider race as a factor in admissions, so long as its practice was narrowly tailored “to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.""Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who penned the majority opinion in Grutter, predicted that after 25 years, affirmative action would no longer be necessary to make colleges more diverse.""How will we know when the time has come?"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked about O'Connor's prediction during arguments in the UNC case.In concurring with the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that under the 14th Amendment, ""the color of a person’s skin is irrelevant to that individual’s equal status as a citizen of this nation.”In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it irrelevant in reality.""And having so detached itself from this country’s actual past and present experiences, the court has now been lured into interfering with the crucial work that UNC and other institutions of higher learning are do- ing to solve America’s real-world problems.""Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

He said further mediation will drive negotiators closer to an agreement that helps both sides.The union’s move is the strongest step yet toward a strike by any of the major pilot unions, which are seeking large pay raises as travel and airline revenue rebound from the pandemic.Earlier this year, pilots at Delta Air Lines ratified a contract giving them raises of 34% over four years. United Airlines pilots are still bargaining, and the union for American Airlines pilots is considering whether to hold a ratification vote on a tentative agreement between the airline and union negotiators.In a letter to mediators, union officials said Dallas-based Southwest has been “evasive” and refuses to seriously discuss pay, work rules and other topics.Dallas-based Southwest has more than 9,300 pilots.]"

Higher air-travel demand scenario was the primary catalyst behind management’s upbeat projections.Southwest Airlines LUV was also in the news following the pay-related tentative deal between the carrier and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (“AMFA”). AMFA represents nearly 2,800 mechanics and related employees at Southwest Airlines. An expansion-related update was also available from Alaska Airlines, the wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group ALK,in the past week.Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. DAL’s management anticipates full-year adjusted earnings to be $6 per share, in line with the top end of its previous expectation in the $5-$6 range. The company attributes this positive outlook to strong air travel demand. Delta expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.25-$2.50 for second-quarter 2023. The earlier expectation was in the range of $2-$2.25. Delta also raised its revenue outlook for the second quarter, expecting growth between 17% and 18% (up from the previous range of 15-17%).

The provisional deal covers more than 2,800 mechanics and related employees at Southwest Airlines, including aircraft maintenance technicians, aircraft inspectors, maintenance controllers and training instructors. It is important to note that the tentative deal will only become effective if it is approved through the voting process.Story continues3.  To meet the anticipated demand swell during winter this year, Alaska Airlines’ management decided to add four new routes to its network. Under its expansion plan, the carrier added its first-ever non-stop flights to the Bahamas from Los Angeles and Seattle. The flights will operate from Dec 15, 2023, to Apr 9, 2024.

The Las Vegas-Cabo San Lucas flights will operate four times a week, from Dec 15, 2023 to Apr 10, 2024. The Las Vegas-Puerto Vallarta flights will operate four times a week from Dec 14, 2023 to Apr 9, 2024.4. According to a Reuters report, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY expects passenger numbers in central and eastern Europe (CEE) to register an increase of at least 50% over the next 10 years.

The institution has been catering to the education needs of the country’s children for over ten decades. The partnership equips 332 branch offices of Fundacion Donde to offer enhanced money transfer services of Western Union. Therefore, it will be a great opportunity for the partners’ clients to seamlessly and safely send as well as receive money across WU’s expansive network spanning more than 200 countries and territories.The maximum payout limit per remittance that has been allotted to Mexican families using WU’s remittance services at the abovementioned Fundacion Donde branches has been fixed at $50,000 MXN. Additionally, the money transfer services can be availed on all days of the week.The recent tie-up reinforces Western Union’s efforts to strengthen its extensive network, generate development opportunities, minimize financial inequalities and extend a hassle-free money transfer experience for its customers.Apart from offering increased and varied money transfer choices to Mexican families, Western Union’s keen eye to strengthen its presence in the country can also be reflected through the latest move. And Fundacion Donde seems to be the apt partner for complementing WU’s endeavor as the former boasts a solid presence in Mexico.The 332 branches of Fundacion Donde, which is a significant number, will result in greater utilization of Western Union’s money transfer services. This, in turn, might boost its money transfer revenues in the days ahead and provide an impetus to its top line as WU primarily derives its revenues from consideration paid by customers to transfer money.The intensified focus of Western Union in establishing a solid footprint in Mexico can be attributed to the significant remittance receipts witnessed by the country.  Per the analytical report of Banco de Mexico, remittance income from overseas witnessed an annual growth of 11.2% in February 2023.Story continuesTherefore, Western Union seems well-poised to occupy a significant share in the remittance market of Mexico, thanks to its speedy and affordable money transfer services. In March 2023, WU teamed up with one of the world’s largest retail chains - 7-Eleven Mexico - to let the country’s consumers avail of WU’s remittance services at over 1,800 locations.Several tie-ups with financial service providers and substantial investments pursued over the years have imparted strength to WU to build a powerful digital platform. The strength of the platform makes it the preferred partner for conducting money transfers across every corner of the globe.

PPG recently said new research has shown energy savings and other manufacturing benefits for tire manufacturers using PPG Agilon performance silica technology. According to the research, PPG Agilon silica conserves around 50% of energy and reduces manufacturing time by one-third compared to traditional silica by eliminating one mixing step.PPG Agilon precipitated silica is chemically modified, allowing tire companies to omit a manufacturing phase in which high-density silica interacts with silane. This non-value-added processing step is redundant since PPG formulates PPG Agilon performance silica by precipitating silica and silane together, conserving energy and lowering production complexity.The study shows that employing PPG Agilon silica can result in lower energy consumption, reduced mixer wear and enhanced plant throughput. PPG strives to improve its manufacturing skills and satisfy the needs of today's tire business while also contributing to its environmental goals.In addition, the latest research discovered enhanced mixer fill factor (the ratio between the volumes of material put in a mixer and the total mixer volume), larger silica loadings, lower mixer temperature and reduced water use. End users will also get considerable sustainability benefits.PPG Agilon silica products are designed to extend the tire industry’s ‘magic triangle,' encompassing minimized rolling resistance for more efficient combustion, strengthening traction for enhanced security and handling, and durable construction to extend tire useful life.Shares of PPG have gained 23.3% over the past year compared with a 12.9% rise of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company, on its first-quarter earnings call, noted that it expects adjusted earnings of $6.95-$7.25 per share for 2023. The prediction excludes amortization expense, non-cash pension settlement charge, benefit from insurance recovery and costs related to earlier approved and communicated business restructuring.Factoring in current global economic activities, geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries, PPG expects sales volumes for second-quarter 2023 to be flat with the potential for slight improvement or decrease of a low single-digit percentage year over year. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter are projected in the band of $2.05-$2.15.Story continuesPPG Industries, Inc.

PPG recently announced an agreement with NRG Energy Inc. brand Direct Energy, allowing it to reduce the carbon footprint of four PPG paints and coatings manufacturing facilities and 62 PPG Paints stores in Texas.Per the Environmental Protection Agency's greenhouse gas (GHG) equivalencies calculator, the move is expected to reduce PPG's total GHG emissions by more than 9,400 metric tons (MT) annually. This is the equivalent of powering 2,092 traditional combustion engine vehicles for one year, each driving 11,000 miles.PPG's Gainesville, Temple, Dallas and Grand Prairie manufacturing facilities, as well as 62 PPG Paints stores in Texas, will purchase Renewable Energy Certificates generated by a wind facility in Crockett County, TX, as a result of the agreement with Direct Energy. This is expected to help reduce emissions associated with their annual power usage. The arrangement covers about 126,000 megawatt hours (MWh).Earlier, PPG announced a power purchase deal with energy firm Constellation for its Adrian, MI, facility, which is likely to help it reduce its carbon footprint by more than 2,400 metric tons per year. Its Carrollton, TX, plant is also powered with clean, renewable energy from the 200 MW Big Star Solar Project as part of an agreement with Constellation.Shares of PPG have gained 25.4% over the past year compared with a 13.4% rise of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company, on its first-quarter earnings call, noted that it expects adjusted earnings of $6.95-$7.25 per share for 2023. The prediction excludes amortization expense, non-cash pension settlement charge, benefit from insurance recovery and costs related to earlier approved and communicated business restructuring.Factoring in current global economic activities, geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries, PPG expects sales volumes for second-quarter 2023 to be flat with the potential for slight improvement or decrease of a low single-digit percentage year over year.

(NYSE:GS) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President &amp; COO, John Waldron, for US$5.2m worth of shares, at about US$387 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$314. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Insiders in Goldman Sachs Group didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. In total, insiders dumped US$5.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.6% of the company, currently worth about US$529m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Goldman Sachs Group Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Goldman Sachs Group has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.But note: Goldman Sachs Group may not be the best stock to buy.

But behind this cinematic extravaganza lies a tale of reinvention and strategic prowess by Mattel, the renowned toy company.Richard Dickson, president and chief operating officer of Mattel, shed light on the struggles, triumphs, and the future of the iconic 'Barbie' brand in a conversation with Fortune at Cannes Lions—the creative industry's equivalent of the Oscars.A Challenging RoadWhile Mattel's legacy spans nearly eight decades, it hasn't all been smooth sailing for 'Barbie'.Dickson acknowledged the brand's past struggles, admitting: ""Consumers didn't think that she was relevant. She didn't reflect the world that kids live in.""This sentiment was reinforced by internal market research in 2014 that revealed Barbie's diminishing appeal and her inability to inspire and represent diversity. Dickson said the brand hit its lowest point in over 14 years, marking a pivotal and arduous time for Mattel.""Moms were choosing other brands besides Barbie, the business itself was reflecting that,"" he said.Reinventing BarbieTo reverse the decline, Mattel embarked on a comprehensive rebranding strategy, using the playbook which was the springboard to many of the brand's smash-hit successes.Dickson outlined its four key components, the first being a reevaluation of the brand's purpose. ""Why do we even exist? What made us great to begin with?"" he said.For Barbie, it meant reigniting her original essence of ""inspiring the limitless potential of girls"", a vision Ruth Handler, Barbie's founder, embraced when she created the 11-and-a-half-inch doll.Story continuesThe second component focuses on design-led innovation, ensuring inclusivity and representation through doll development. Mattel aimed to create dolls that mirrored the diverse world around us, including the release of its first-ever doll with Down's syndrome.Remaining culturally relevant is the third pillar of the playbook, enabling Mattel to tap into the pulse of society and connect with its target audience.Finally, executing with excellence was paramount, ensuring that brilliant ideas seamlessly transition into tangible market offerings.""Great ideas are great, but if you can't bring them to market, they’re nothing but great ideas,"" Dickson said.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNEmArEojhIA glimpse into the futureToday, Mattel stands on the precipice of a monumental theatrical event—the release of the Barbie movie starring Hollywood A-listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, which was such an enormous production effort that it sparked a global shortage of hot pink paint.But that turnaround has only been made possible due to the efficacy of the playbook in practice, and Dickson proudly announced: ""We hit our highest level of business ever in 2021.""Mattel's journey of reinvention, however, does not end here.Looking to the future, Dickson mapped out Mattel's strategic vision—unlocking the value of their intellectual property, or IP.While Barbie takes the lead with her foray into the theatrical realm, Mattel has a lineup of 13 other brands in various stages of film development, ranging from theatrical releases to television shows, live experiences, and digital gaming.The objective is clear: to present Mattel's cherished IP through captivating storytelling formats, thereby boosting toy sales, consumer product relevance, and impact across diverse categories.As the Barbie movie serves as a catalyst, it paves the way for an era of creativity and content creation at Mattel.The company's commitment to unlocking the potential of its IP ensures that audiences can anticipate more captivating movies and experiences to come.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) so let's look a bit deeper.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Schlumberger is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$4.6b ÷ (US$44b - US$12b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Schlumberger has an ROCE of 15%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Energy Services industry average of 9.8% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Schlumberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Schlumberger here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWe're pretty happy with how the ROCE has been trending at Schlumberger. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 156% over the trailing five years. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 43% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets.Story continuesOur Take On Schlumberger's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Schlumberger has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Given the stock has declined 15% in the last five years, this could be a good investment if the valuation and other metrics are also appealing. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting.If you want to continue researching Schlumberger, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Amid this scenario, customers are working to lower their high inventory levels, impacting the order flow and demand for Packaging Corp’s products.Containerboard production in the upcoming quarters will likely be lower as the company plans to match production with demand.Packaging Corp expects to complete the scheduled annual maintenance outage and the first phase of the containerboard conversion work on the No. 3 machine at the Jackson, AL-based mill. The No.3 machine has reached the first-phase design capacity and is producing high-quality virgin linerboard.However, given the current containerboard demand, the company decided to postpone the second phase of the conversion work until 2024.Lower Prices to Hurt MarginsThe company anticipates lower prices in the Packaging segment in the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the recent decreases in the domestic containerboard prices  and lower export prices.In the Paper segment, the company will continue implementing the price increase that took effect in September 2022, with a fairly flat sales volume.Cost Headwinds Weigh on MarginsLabor costs and certain indirect costs are expected to be elevated in the upcoming quarters. Inflated prices for many chemicals, particularly starch and caustic soda, remain headwinds.

102,2c5e67b9-83df-31ae-9dae-7cd5027d6299,HOLX,2023-06-30,OPKO Health's (OPK) NGENLA Approved by FDA for GHD Treatment,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opko-healths-opk-ngenla-approved-152300593.html,1688052180,STORY,"['OPK', 'PFE', 'HOLX', 'HQY']","[OPKO Health, Inc. OPK, along with Pfizer Inc. PFE, recently confirmed that the FDA had approved NGENLA (somatrogon-ghla), a once-weekly human growth hormone analog indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged three years and older having growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone. NGENLA is expected to become available for U.S. prescribing in August 2023.OPKO Health entered into a worldwide agreement with Pfizer in 2014 for the development and commercialization of somatrogon for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD). According to the agreement, OPKO Health had to conduct the clinical program while Pfizer was responsible for registering and commercializing somatrogon for GHD.The latest approval for NGENLA in the United States follows its approval for the treatment of pediatric GHD in more than 40 markets, including Canada, Australia, Japan and EU Member States. The latest FDA approval is expected to significantly strengthen OPKO Health’s position through the global sales of NGENLA, a component of the company’s broader Pharmaceuticals business.Background of the ApprovalThe FDA approval is supported by results from a multi-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled Phase 3 study, which assessed the safety and efficacy of NGENLA when administered once-weekly compared to once-daily somatropin. The study met its primary endpoint of NGENLA’s non-inferiority compared to somatropin, as measured by annual height velocity at 12 months. NGENLA was generally well-tolerated in the study and had a safety profile comparable to somatropin.Significance of the ApprovalPer OPKO Health, GHD is a rare disease characterized by the inadequate secretion of the growth hormone somatropin from the pituitary gland. This affects approximately one in 4,000-10,000 children. If not treated, children will likely have persistent growth attenuation, a very short height in adulthood and delayed puberty. Children living with GHD may also experience challenges in relation to their physical health and mental well-being.Story continuesPer an expert familiar with the use of NGENLA, the latest regulatory approval is expected to be significant for children with GHD in the United States as it can potentially reduce the treatment burden that results from daily growth hormone injections. This will likely make NGENLA an important treatment option that can improve adherence for children being treated for GHD.OPKO Health’s management believes that the latest FDA approval will likely better address the GHD patients and their families.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global human growth hormone market was valued at $3,864.00 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $9,211.63 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 9%.

This was mainly due to the reduction in the company’s Prescription Drug Plan membership and the loss of commercial clients at Elixir, partly offset by increased Retail Pharmacy segment revenues stemming from higher pharmacy sales.In the fiscal first quarter, the Retail Pharmacy segment's revenues rose 3.4%, driven by an increase in acute and maintenance prescriptions, somewhat offset by reduced COVID-19 vaccine and testing revenues, and store closures.Retail Pharmacy same-store sales moved up 8.4%, driven by a 13.3% rise in pharmacy sales, somewhat offset by a 4.4% decline in front-end same-store sales. Excluding cigarettes and tobacco products, front-end same-store sales fell 3.8% from the year-ago period’s reading.Prescription count at same-store sales, adjusted to 30-day equivalent, rose 4.7% on the back of non-COVID-19 prescriptions (up 7.4%), acute prescriptions (up 6.8%) and maintenance prescriptions (up 7.6%). Prescription sales constituted 73.9% of overall drugstore sales. The total store count at the end of the reported quarter was 2,284.In the Pharmacy Services segment, revenues declined 31% due to the client loss announced earlier and reduced Elixir Insurance membership, partly offset by increased utilization and a rise in drug costs.In the reported quarter, adjusted EBITDA fell 18% from the year-ago period to $21.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 1.8% in the quarter under review.Story continuesSG&amp;A expenses increased 3.1% from the year-ago period to $1,255.2 million.Financial StatusRite Aid ended the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $135.5 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $3,328 million, and a total shareholders' equity deficit of $947.4 million. For fiscal 2024, capital expenditure is anticipated to be $175 million.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Rite Aid Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteFY24 OutlookManagememnt expects revenues of $22.6-$23.0 billion for fiscal 2024.

RGF or Real Good Foods is making waves in the health and wellness food industry as it expands its product line and strengthens its partnership with retail giant Walmart WMT. The leading health and wellness frozen food company has revealed plans to expand its innovative Breaded Chicken and Asian Entrees platforms to more than 4,000 Walmart stores nationwide by the end of June 2023.This expansion represents a major stride toward Real Good Foods' overarching mission of enhancing the lives of millions by making nutritious food more accessible. With more than 90% of Americans residing within a 10-mile radius of a Walmart store, the increased distribution will ensure that a vast number of people have convenient access to Real Good Foods' products.One of the standout offerings from Real Good Foods is Breaded Chicken Nuggets &amp; Strips. Compared to the leading breaded chicken brand available in grocery stores, Real Good Foods' products contain nearly double the protein and significantly lower carbs. Moreover, they are low in sodium. This distinction stems from Real Good Foods' use of proprietary breading that is high in protein, grain-free, and gluten-free, as opposed to processed sugar, flour and grains found in conventional chicken nuggets. In addition, Real Good Foods utilizes whole muscle chicken breast, resulting in just 2-3 grams of net carbs and an impressive 23 grams of protein per serving.Another compelling offering from Real Good Foods is its Asian Entrees, which offers 1 gram of sugar and 20 grams or more of protein per serving. In comparison, other Asian entrees currently available in the market contain over 45 grams of sugar per box and less protein. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBryan Freeman, the executive chairman of Real Good Foods, acknowledged the growing demand for nutritious options among consumers. He emphasized the significance of the company's expansion into Walmart stores, which will now make these healthier food choices easily accessible. Freeman expressed pride in being able to offer delicious and nutritious options that address the lack of access to better foods, a key factor behind the rising diabetes epidemic.Real Good Foods' partnership with Walmart presents an exciting opportunity for both companies. With an increased reach across the nation, Real Good Foods can make a positive impact on the health and well-being of individuals, while Walmart can enhance its product portfolio and cater to the rising demand for healthier food choices. As the expansion rolls out, Real Good Foods remains committed to improving human health and looks forward to further opportunities to accomplish this goal.Story continuesStock PerformanceReal Good Food Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

And some of the largest companies are facing pressure on their pipelines with patents expiring for some major brands in the next few years. AbbVie (ABBV) lost exclusivity on its blockbuster Humira this year, and Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) Stelara will lose its patent this fall.Moody's senior vice president for investor services, Michael Levesque, said as much Thursday.""Pressure points will rise in 2025 and beyond, including a steeper patent cliff, drug pricing changes in the US Inflation Reduction Act, and proposed changes to European drug regulations,"" he wrote in a note to investors.But Medicare and patents aren't the only battles. Pushback from the US Federal Trade Commission is another hurdle for the industry. One recent example is the FTC's efforts, joined by several states, to stop Amgen's (AMGN) potential $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics.That is a problem for an industry flush with cash, eager to engage in M&amp;A that would help thwart Medicare efforts to control pricing. At last tally, in December 2022, the 15 largest investment-grade issuers were sitting on $164 billion, Levesque said.But there's optimism too: Blockbuster drug sales and the hot new obesity drug market will help drive earnings growth.Signage is seen outside the Moody's Corporation headquarters in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 12, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (Andrew Kelly / reuters)""Rising sales of...drugs treating cancer, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes/obesity will drive 2-4% earnings growth,"" Levesque said.Another bright spot, albeit smaller, is the uptick in COVID vaccines for the fall and winter, which will mostly benefit Pfizer (PFE), he said.""We could change our outlook to positive if we expect annual EBITDA growth above 4% over a future 12-18 months period. This could occur if there are material new product launches in under-treated diseases, if the impact of patent exposures declines, or if treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 see rising rather than weakening demand,"" Levesque wrote.Story continues""We could change our outlook to negative if our expectation for EBITDA growth falls below 0%.

President and Fellows of Harvard, and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented in both cases, with Jackson, a Harvard Law alumna, having recused from voting on the case involving the college.Dozens of major corporations across various industries took interest in the case, including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), General Motors (GM), General Dynamics (GD), Dell, and Starbucks (SBUX).Those companies and nearly 40 others joined in an amicus brief contending that diversity in higher education ultimately helps their businesses by providing a diverse pool from which they can recruit.The supporters went on to argue that doing away with the policy would also weaken the military’s pool of eligible college-trained recruits.The Supreme Court in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The decisions overhaul a string of Supreme Court cases that address the role of race in institutionalized education, starting with the high court’s landmark 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. In Brown the court outlawed race-based segregation in public schools.The court acknowledged that its prior rulings permitted race-based admissions, saying it did so only ""within the confines of narrow restrictions.""University programs, the court said, must comply with strict scrutiny — the highest standard of review applied to constitutional questions. In writing for the majority, Roberts said the universities therefore ""may never use race as a stereotype or negative, and — at some point — they must end.""Story continuesThe challenger in both cases, Students for Fair Admissions, argued that affirmative action is illegal in public and private college settings because it penalizes equally qualified Asian-American and other minority applicants.The group, led by conservative activist Edward Blum, claimed that UNC’s consideration of race violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which bars government entities and public universities from discriminating based on race.Students walk through Harvard Yard on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)In its case against Harvard, a private university, the organization claimed that the school’s admissions policy violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bars race-based discrimination by organizations that take federal funds.Specifically, Students for Fair Admissions asked the court overturn its 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger, which held the University of Michigan's Law School could consider race as a factor in admissions, so long as its practice was narrowly tailored “to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.""Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who penned the majority opinion in Grutter, predicted that after 25 years, affirmative action would no longer be necessary to make colleges more diverse.""How will we know when the time has come?"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked about O'Connor's prediction during arguments in the UNC case.In concurring with the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that under the 14th Amendment, ""the color of a person’s skin is irrelevant to that individual’s equal status as a citizen of this nation.”In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it irrelevant in reality.""And having so detached itself from this country’s actual past and present experiences, the court has now been lured into interfering with the crucial work that UNC and other institutions of higher learning are do- ing to solve America’s real-world problems.""Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

122,e1d6e3f3-e6c3-3ece-aa18-0d03b4811e53,WYNN,2023-06-30,"Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wynn-resorts-limited-wynn-trending-130007104.html,1688043607,STORY,['WYNN'],"[Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this casino operator have returned +5.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Gaming industry, to which Wynn belongs, has gained 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Wynn is expected to post earnings of $0.32 per share, indicating a change of +139% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +140.7%. This estimate has changed +7.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.56 indicates a change of +150.7% from what Wynn is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wynn.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Wynn, the consensus sales estimate of $1.48 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +62.4%. The $6.01 billion and $6.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +59.9% and +12.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWynn reported revenues of $1.42 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +49.3%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with -$1.21 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.5%. The EPS surprise was +261.11%.Over the last four quarters, Wynn surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wynn is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wynn. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

135,11781498-774b-303e-8ff9-15048c570cd6,QCOM,2023-06-30,New AI Chip Export Rules Put Semiconductor Firms in Spotlight,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-chip-export-rules-put-121500940.html,1688040900,STORY,"['INTC', 'QCOM', 'AMD', 'NVDA']","[The simmering Sino-U.S. geopolitical tensions have taken a new dimension, with reports emerging that the Biden administration is mulling new export control measures to regulate the flow of AI chips to China. The fresh restrictions follow a sweeping set of rules issued by the White House in October 2022. These are likely to deal a huge blow to domestic semiconductor firms, jeopardizing the sustainability of their business.AI chips are used in “training” AI systems to solve complex problems in split seconds. These chips include graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), along with other AI-optimized design features. These features dramatically accelerate the identical, predictable and independent calculations required by AI algorithms.   Cutting-edge AI systems need state-of-the-art AI chips as their older counterparts with larger, slower and more power-hungry transistors incur huge energy costs that escalate production costs to unaffordable levels. These cost and speed dynamics make it virtually impossible to develop and deploy cutting-edge AI algorithms without state-of-the-art AI chips that are typically manufactured by U.S. semiconductor firms like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Intel Corporation INTC and Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM.Per a Reuters report, the U.S. administration is contemplating enforcing two restrictions that focus on how fast chips communicate with each other and how much computing power they possess. As AI chips require perfect synchronization among themselves for superior performance standards, the new restrictions are likely to impede their proper functioning. Although no official communication has been made public so far, officials privy to these discussions have revealed that an update to the proposed rules could surface as early as July this year.The fresh salvo aimed at curbing China’s access to advanced computing power follows a set of rules released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on Oct 7, 2022. These rules prohibited U.S. firms from exporting to the communist nation the technology, software and equipment used in producing advanced computing chips and supercomputers. They also debarred people with U.S. nationality from supporting certain China-based chip companies without approval from the federal government.These rules made it harder for companies like NVIDIA and Advanced Micro to sell their products to China, which generated a lion’s share of their revenues. In order to sustain its profitability, NVIDIA designed GPU chips A800 and H800, particularly for the China market. However, experts believe that these export-compliant chips could be used by China to train more advanced AI chips, which could then be used for cyber espionage and/or harm U.S. security interests. Perhaps concerns regarding these sovereign security interests forced the Biden government to consider curtailing the computing power of these chips and impede China's capability to harness the same for its overall growth.But such sweeping restrictions could endanger the business operations of NVIDIA, whose leading position in the AI chip market was one of the driving factors behind its reaching a valuation of more than $1 trillion earlier this year. It is also likely to affect the sales of Advanced Micro, although it has declined to comment on the proceedings.While the immediate effect of the export control measures on Intel and Qualcomm is yet to be fathomed, the companies are certainly monitoring the situation from close quarters as it could potentially hinder their future offerings, with China being a significant market for their products. Intel and Qualcomm have also refused to comment on the proposed government rules.The stance of the Biden administration to protect its dominance in the semiconductor industry and thwart the emergence of China as a technology superpower is likely to have far-reaching economic and geopolitical implications. With stringent export restrictions, the government is limiting the ability of domestic firms to innovate and compete globally. As the industry awaits further clarity on the U.S. government's decision, the semiconductor firms will need to strategize and adapt to potential changes to better navigate this complex landscape and ensure their continued success in the dynamic global market.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And some of the largest companies are facing pressure on their pipelines with patents expiring for some major brands in the next few years. AbbVie (ABBV) lost exclusivity on its blockbuster Humira this year, and Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) Stelara will lose its patent this fall.Moody's senior vice president for investor services, Michael Levesque, said as much Thursday.""Pressure points will rise in 2025 and beyond, including a steeper patent cliff, drug pricing changes in the US Inflation Reduction Act, and proposed changes to European drug regulations,"" he wrote in a note to investors.But Medicare and patents aren't the only battles. Pushback from the US Federal Trade Commission is another hurdle for the industry. One recent example is the FTC's efforts, joined by several states, to stop Amgen's (AMGN) potential $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics.That is a problem for an industry flush with cash, eager to engage in M&amp;A that would help thwart Medicare efforts to control pricing. At last tally, in December 2022, the 15 largest investment-grade issuers were sitting on $164 billion, Levesque said.But there's optimism too: Blockbuster drug sales and the hot new obesity drug market will help drive earnings growth.Signage is seen outside the Moody's Corporation headquarters in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 12, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (Andrew Kelly / reuters)""Rising sales of...drugs treating cancer, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes/obesity will drive 2-4% earnings growth,"" Levesque said.Another bright spot, albeit smaller, is the uptick in COVID vaccines for the fall and winter, which will mostly benefit Pfizer (PFE), he said.""We could change our outlook to positive if we expect annual EBITDA growth above 4% over a future 12-18 months period. This could occur if there are material new product launches in under-treated diseases, if the impact of patent exposures declines, or if treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 see rising rather than weakening demand,"" Levesque wrote.Story continues""We could change our outlook to negative if our expectation for EBITDA growth falls below 0%.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Medtronic The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.46bUS$5.88bUS$5.71bUS$5.78bUS$6.53bUS$6.93bUS$7.23bUS$7.50bUS$7.74bUS$7.96bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.40%Est @ 3.71%Est @ 3.23%Est @ 2.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$5.0kUS$4.9kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.1%) = US$113bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$113b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$47bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$88b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$86.4, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.001. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MedtronicStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

QuoteFactors That Augur WellBeing a leading waste disposal company, Republic Services is expected to continue benefiting from ongoing trends like increasing environmental concerns, rapid industrialization, increase in population and active government measures to reduce illegal dumping.The company remains focused on expanding its recycling volume through improved material handling processes and programs. RSG developed its first Polymer Center last year to increase the recycling of plastics across North America. The company’s top line increased 20.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2023.Republic Services is focused on increasing its operational efficiency and reducing fleet operating costs by shifting to compressed natural gas (CNG) collection vehicles. In 2022, around 20% of the company’s recycling and solid waste collection fleet operated on CNG and 17% of its replacement recycling and solid waste vehicle purchases were CNG vehicles.Republic Services puts consistent efforts into rewarding its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, it paid $592.9 million, $552.6 million and $522.5 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $203.5 million, $252.2 million and $98.8 million, respectively. Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.

It also produces pylons for the Airbus A220.The new four-year contract, which union leaders endorsed on Tuesday, includes additional wage increases, allowed employees to keep their current health care plans and eradicated mandatory overtime on the weekends - three features that workers had earmarked as priorities for a deal.The agreement is a boon for Boeing, which is on the verge of increasing MAX production from 31 jets to 38 jets per month. Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said on June 18 the production ramp was set to occur ""pretty soon.""Deal, in a statement to Boeing's workforce after the contract ratification, said the company continued to assess potential impacts to production or deliveries.Although Boeing maintains some buffer inventory, analysts had warned a prolonged strike could have forced the company to slow or stop MAX production. Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr wrote in a June 22 note to clients that a two- to three-week work stoppage could start to impact 737 output.Michel Merluzeau, director of aerospace market analysis for AIR consulting group, said the agreement ""provides some degree of stability"" as Boeing looks forward to negotiations with its Seattle-area machinists union next year.It also resolves a major dilemma for Spirit, which has been under financial pressure and expects to burn cash this year. The company has been the source of several high-profile production defects on Boeing jets, such the incorrect installation of a bracket on the 737's vertical tail.

NOC clinched a contract involving E-2D Hawkeye aircraft. The award has been offered by the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Weapon Systems Support (WSS), Philadelphia, PA.Details of the DealValued at $15.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Northrop will conduct repair and overhaul of 270 power amplifier modules to support the E-2D aircraft. These jets are used in the NAVSUP WSS Integrated Weapon Support Team’s program.Majority of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Woodland Hills, CA.Importance of E-2D Hawkeye JetNorthrop’s E-2D Hawkeye aircraft boasts battle management, theater air, missile defense and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system. These provide the warfighter with expanded battlespace awareness, especially in the area of information operations.Through its effective radar sensor and robust network-enabled capability, the Advanced Hawkeye aircraft provides critical, actionable data to joint forces and first responders.Such features of the aircraft make it attractive for the military, resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. The new orders are likely to boost Northrop’s revenue generation prospects in the military aircraft business arena.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. To this end, a military aircraft that forms an integral part of any air defense system is likely to witness pent-up demand.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military aircraft market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% over the 2022-2031 period. Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop as its military aviation system offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aircraft market.The abounding growth prospects of the military aircraft market should also benefit other defense majors that manufacture combat jets, including Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT.Story continuesLockheed’s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.

(Photo: Eric Kulisch/FreightWaves)Amerijet International on Wednesday terminated more than a dozen employees because of sharply lower revenues associated with a prolonged slump in global air cargo demand that is beginning to materially hurt more freighter operators.The move comes on the heels of the company’s pilots on Friday ratifying a new three-year contract that raises their pay up to 45%, increasing expenses for the Miami-based all-cargo carrier at a time of shrinking sales.“Over the past several months, our company, like many others in the air cargo business, has faced several challenges and market shifts that have impacted our financial stability. Despite our best efforts to mitigate these challenges with cost reductions and avoidances across the board, it has become necessary for us to take action to ensure the long-term sustainability of our organization,” said CEO Tim Strauss in a memo to staff announcing the reduction in force that was shared with FreightWaves.“We have had to make some tough choices to align our resources with our strategic goals and create a leaner, more agile organization for the future. … We all recognize that our economy is severely impaired currently, but when the news hits close to home, it always comes as a shock,” said Strauss, who expressed gratitude for the contributions of those let go.Amerijet terminated 15 workers at its headquarters, spokeswoman Christine Richard said in an email response. An industry source familiar with the company said the layoffs were in several departments where compensation is significantly less than that for pilots. Workers will receive several weeks’ severance pay, according to the person.The job eliminations are the latest cost measure at Amerijet. Earlier this year, the airline shut down its small freight forwarding division that employed 27 people, and it outsourced accounting functions to Trinidad and Tobago.Richard said Amerijet has reduced its flight schedule to Aruba and Brussels because of the downturn in business.Story continuesAmerijet has 24 cargo jets, including planes operated for DHL and Maersk Air Cargo, under its operating certificate. One of DHL’s 767-200s has not flown since April 5, according to flight-data provider Flightradar24.Tim Millar, the chairman of the Amerijet local division of the Air Line Pilots Association, said the new labor contract was crucial to slow attrition because the pilots “were at the bottom of the scale” compared to competitors.The company is still actively hiring pilots, with a class of 24 undergoing training now and another class of at least a dozen pilots starting in a couple of weeks, he said.Amerijet has more than 270 pilots, according to the union.Airfreight sector feels pressureThe rate of decline in air cargo volumes has slowed since the start of the year, but airlines are coping with 16-consecutive months of negative growth. Volumes are down 1% to 4% year over year, according to various market watchers. Last year cargo traffic shrank 8% from the extraordinary high in 2021, when shippers sought out airlift to get around pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. The downturn in volumes reached about 10% in the December-January period.Cargo jet utilization fell 5.3% year over year in April and May, according to research from BMO Capital Markets.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently projected air cargo demand will shrink 3.8% for the full year and airline cargo revenues will contract by a third to $142.3 billion year over year as a surge in passenger flights ushers in more belly space and global trade slows. Market dynamics mean yields will come in nearly 30% below last year’s average, the trade association said.Cargo volumes are 5.3% below 2019 levels.The freight recession is forcing cargo airlines of all sizes to downsize their operations.FedEx Express last week said it plans to park 29 more aircraft during the fiscal year that runs through May 31, 2024, in response to falling demand and a corporate campaign to take out billions of dollars in structural costs. It is also consolidating maintenance facilities, routes and crew bases. The delivery company’s flight activity fell 12% in the previous quarter.Western Global Airlines, also based in Florida, is also being pinched by poor sales, high maintenance costs for its aging fleet, pilot attrition and a heavy debt load. The company appears to be winding down flight activity ahead of a possible bankruptcy filing.Cargojet, a Canadian carrier, recently postponed plans to convert large Boeing 777 passenger jets into freighters and is selling them off instead to focus on debt reduction and improving returns.Click here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.RECOMMENDED READING:Western Global Airlines grounds cargo jets as bankruptcy rumors swirlAir cargo’s busy season looking more like a molehill than mountain peakCargo airline Amerijet pulls plug on freight forwarding unitFedEx to close pilot bases in Alaska, California and GermanyThe post Amerijet lays off workers as freight recession drags on appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past six months (+40.7% vs. +39.0%) on the back of the company's AI leverage. The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues have been driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.Productivity and Business Processes revenues continues to increase due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth.However, More Personal Computing revenues decreased due to weak Windows and Devices businesses. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. Also, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Alcohol industry over the past year (+4.6% vs. +2.5%). The company has been benefiting from continued business momentum, which resulted in top and bottom-line growth in first-quarter 2023. Further, the company’s relentless execution, investment in brands and accelerated digital transformation aided performance.The top line benefited from strong consumer demand for its portfolio, consistent execution of its strategy and strength of the beer category globally. The expansion of the Beyond Beer portfolio, and investments in B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing bode well. Backed by the continued business momentum, the company outlined its view for 2023.However, shares of AB InBev lagged the industry in the past three months on lower-than-expected earnings in the first quarter. AB InBev’s gross and EBIT margin declined in the first-quarter, driven by higher cost of sales and SG&amp;A expense.(You can read the full research report on Anheuser-Busch here &gt;&gt;&gt;)HCA Healthcare shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry over the past year (+79.9% vs. +66.5%). The company’s revenues remain on an uptick on the back of a surge in admissions, outpatient surgeries and other procedures. Multiple buyouts aided it in increasing patient volumes, enabled network expansion, added hospitals to its portfolio and boosted business scale.HCA Healthcare has been gaining from its telemedicine business line. HCA Healthcare resorts to prudent capital deployment via buybacks and dividends. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had $3.7 billion left under its buyback authorization. A solid business outlook added to the positives.However, the company's escalating operating expenses have been weighing on the margins. A high debt level induces rise in interest expenses.

It is also the first time the AWC will be used to provide for a holistic and scalable EVSE solution to support both current and future electrification requirements.The AWC provides a public-private partnership with regulated servicing utility companies to cover utility service needs of Federal agencies within the franchise territory of the supplier for up to 10 years. This unique federal construct allowed MCLB Albany to use the ""Make Ready"" program to accelerate their plans and maximize the Government's investment. In the Make Ready program, Georgia Power owns, installs and maintains the electrical infrastructure up to the charger itself. The program is available to all business customers and helps remove potential financial barriers to their transition to electric transportation. As a result of this partnership and project, MCLB Albany is uniquely poised to meet the Biden Administration EO 14057 of a 100% zero-emission fleet.""This modernized energy infrastructure will support our mission and lessen our dependence on fossil fuels,"" said Meredith Berger, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations, and Environment and Chief Sustainability Officer. ""Innovative partnerships and solutions like this make our installations more survivable and the communities they are a part of more resilient.""Story continuesThe EV charging project at MCLB Albany is the latest example of continued successful collaboration between the base and Georgia Power in advancing better energy use and overall modernization, with the base earning national accolades for its efforts.""This is a great partnership with Georgia Power as the DoD looks into the future. We need to prepare the base and Marine Corps to support a future electric vehicle fleet,"" said MCLB Albany Commanding Officer Col. Michael Fitzgerald.This is this just one of many projects underway across the SE that illustrates Southern Company's ability and desire to work with DoD installations to identify and deliver sustainability, resiliency and energy efficiency solutions. It is part of a much broader commitment Southern has made to partner with the federal government in advancing mutual net-zero GHG emission and grid decarbonization goals that benefits both the customers and communities we serve.""In addition to being essential for national defense, our nation's military bases are powerful economic engines for surrounding communities providing jobs and driving thriving local economies,"" said Chris Cummiskey, Executive Vice President, Chief Customer Solutions and Chief Commercial Officer for Southern Company. ""MCLB Albany is a forward-looking military base dedicated to energy innovation and planning for the future, and we're proud of our continued partnership. As the new EV charging stations open across the installation this year, we know the investment that is being made today will benefit the base for years to come.""About Southern Company Southern Company (NYSE: SO) is a leading energy provider serving 9 million customers across the Southeast and beyond through its family of companies.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at TE Connectivity (NYSE:TEL) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for TE Connectivity:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$2.8b ÷ (US$21b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, TE Connectivity has an ROCE of 16%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Electronic industry average of 13% it's much better. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity roceIn the above chart we have measured TE Connectivity's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering TE Connectivity here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For TE Connectivity Tell Us?Over the past five years, TE Connectivity's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect TE Connectivity to be a multi-bagger going forward. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that TE Connectivity has been paying out a decent 31% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On TE Connectivity's ROCEIn summary, TE Connectivity isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Since the stock has gained an impressive 67% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with TE Connectivity and understanding it should be part of your investment process.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

In response, call traders are reinvesting in bank stocks.Wells Fargo &amp; Co (NYSE:WFC) is faring the best today, last seen up 3.6% at $42.06. Today's pop has helped the shares move back above their year-to-date breakeven level, and extend its quarterly lead to 12.3%.Options traders are most interested in the weekly 6/30 42-strike call, which expires at the close tomorrow. Roughly 35,000 calls have been exchanged already, which is double the intraday average amount, versus just 17,000 puts.Call volume is also running at double the amount typically seen at this point for Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Wells Fargo (WFC).Wells Fargo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.84, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.84 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WFCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WFCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Wells Fargo here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Wells Fargo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is WFC Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Wells Fargo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 2.7% over the past month to $4.66.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Wells Fargo.

The fund will provide credit enhancements, including guarantees, loan loss reserves and cash collateral deposits to financing partners to enable them to reasonably increase their risk tolerance to help unlock credit access for underserved high-potential but credit-challenged small business owners.The fund is part of the Equitable Access Program, which provides increased credit access and financial education to high-potential underserved entrepreneurs with credit challenges. The program is run by Hello Alice and GEN. Wells Fargo provided the initial major grant to start the Equitable Access Fund. Financing Partners of the Equitable Access Fund will include First National Bank of Omaha (FNBO), the issuer of the Hello Alice Small Business Mastercard, and select partners in the Hello Alice Financing Marketplace. Additional key partners of the Equitable Access Program include Mastercard and the Kauffman Foundation.The fund, managed by GEN, addresses significant untapped demand for business credit among small businesses, especially in those run by members of the New Majority, which includes women, veterans, BIPOC, Latinx, those with disabilities, and LGTBQ among other groups. According to Hello Alice data, only 25% of small business owners have applied for a business credit card, and 85% of those applications were denied due to poor credit or lack of credit. Even so, 90% of small business owners without business credit believe a business card would impact their business in a positive way. Through the Equitable Access Fund, these owners gain a pathway to accessing a business credit card, building their credit profile, and eventually qualifying for traditional credit and lending products needed to grow their businesses. The $70 million fund aims to unlock up to an estimated $1 billion in credit access for thousands of small business owners. Hello Alice and GEN will continue to work with and bring on new financing partners over the next several months to build out the fund and support small business owners in need of credit to grow.Story continues""There is an estimated $40 billion annually of unmet financing demand from BIPOC-owned employers that applied for financing, and an estimated $1 trillion in unmet financing demand from all small businesses nationally,"" said Elizabeth Gore and Carolyn Rodz, co-founders of Hello Alice. ""The Equitable Access Fund provides credit enhancements that enable our financial partners to reasonably increase their risk tolerance, which ultimately unlocks credit access for those who really need it. We're looking forward to creating more partnerships and bringing more institutions on board to the fund to achieve the goal of equitable access to credit.""""The Equitable Access Fund will open doors for high-potential, credit-challenged entrepreneurs to achieve their full potential as founders, job-creators, and agents of change,"" said Jonathan Ortmans, founder and president of the Global Entrepreneurship Network. ""While our focus is on the United States credit system, we believe the outcomes of this work will also serve as a case study for other nations to learn from and adapt to support under-served entrepreneurs within their jurisdictions.""The Equitable Access Fund is the latest initiative Wells Fargo has supported as part of its larger commitment to expand community engagement and enterprise philanthropy efforts through the Wells Fargo Foundation. The foundation has a strategic focus on small business growth, financial health, and a sustainable future, which are core tenants of the Equitable Access Program and Fund.The Equitable Access Program is part of GEN and Hello Alice's commitment to ensuring that all entrepreneurs and small business owners have access to the capital they need to grow the sustainable businesses that power their communities and economies. As part of the program, small business owners will be provided with wrap-around credit-building education and technical assistance through an assessment tool called the Business Health Score, which launched in April 2023. The score provides a comprehensive overview of a business's financial health, which allows small business owners to make informed decisions about how to improve financial performance and achieve long-term success through a real-time recommendation engine. Both the score and the fund provide an avenue for banks to better serve small businesses and demonstrate the lucrative value of investing in the New Majority.For enterprises or foundations interested in supporting this Fund, please reach out to William Charter at the Global Entrepreneurship Network by emailing charterw@genglobal.org.###ABOUT GENThe Global Entrepreneurship Network operates programs in 200 countries aimed at making it easier for anyone, anywhere to start and scale a business.

It selected Spanish companies Reig Jofre and Laboratorios Hipra SA to reserve capacity for protein-based vaccines and Bilthoven Biologicals B.V. of the Netherlands for vector-based vaccines.Pfizer said it ""understands the urgent need for better pandemic preparedness and response planning and has taken several key steps towards readiness for potential future global disease outbreaks"", without detailing those steps.Reig Jofre said its deal with the EU reserved capacity for four years, with the possibility to extend for a maximum duration of eight years. Neither the companies or the EU disclosed any financial details of the agreement.The World Health Organisation has urged governments and manufacturers to reserve up to 20% of any tests, vaccines or treatments for the global agency to distribute in poorer countries to avoid a repeat of the ""catastrophic failure"" during the COVID pandemic, according to a draft of a global pandemic agreement currently being discussed.

Walensky's signoff is the final key regulatory step ahead of the shots' rollout.Both Pfizer and GSK have said they expect to start supplying the shots this fall ahead of the RSV season.Older adults may receive a single dose of the vaccine after discussions with a healthcare provider about whether RSV vaccination is right for them, the CDC said in a statement on Thursday.""With this CDC recommendation, the administration is ensuring that Americans have access to stronger protection against circulating respiratory viruses,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. Becerra said the vaccines should protect the ""most vulnerable older adults, those living in nursing or long-term care facilities, and the immunocompromised.""At the CDC advisers' meeting last week, some committee members wanted a broader recommendation, but others expressed concerns that there wasn't enough data on how effective the vaccines are in people over age 75 and other high-risk groups. The disease usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but can lead to serious illness and hospitalization, especially among older adults and children.Both Pfizer and GSK presented data at the meeting suggesting the shots could be protective for at least two years, but the additional protection could mean higher prices because of the additional benefit to the health system. Americans over the age of 65 covered by the Medicare program are not expected to pay out of pocket for the vaccines.Story continuesGSK said during the meeting that it expects to price its shot at between $200 and $295 a dose. The company had previously said the price would be at least $120 per dose.At the meeting, Pfizer estimated the price range of $180 to $270 per dose, but did not guarantee that final price would fall within that range, saying it was in the middle of competitive price negotiations on the shots.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May approved the first of the RSV vaccines, from GSK and branded as Arexvy, and later Pfizer's Abrysvo, for people aged 60 and older.Pfizer is awaiting FDA approval of an RSV vaccine for pregnant women aimed at protecting infants. The regulatory process for that shot is behind the vaccines for older adults, and the CDC's advisers have not considered it yet.

And some of the largest companies are facing pressure on their pipelines with patents expiring for some major brands in the next few years. AbbVie (ABBV) lost exclusivity on its blockbuster Humira this year, and Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) Stelara will lose its patent this fall.Moody's senior vice president for investor services, Michael Levesque, said as much Thursday.""Pressure points will rise in 2025 and beyond, including a steeper patent cliff, drug pricing changes in the US Inflation Reduction Act, and proposed changes to European drug regulations,"" he wrote in a note to investors.But Medicare and patents aren't the only battles. Pushback from the US Federal Trade Commission is another hurdle for the industry. One recent example is the FTC's efforts, joined by several states, to stop Amgen's (AMGN) potential $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics.That is a problem for an industry flush with cash, eager to engage in M&amp;A that would help thwart Medicare efforts to control pricing. At last tally, in December 2022, the 15 largest investment-grade issuers were sitting on $164 billion, Levesque said.But there's optimism too: Blockbuster drug sales and the hot new obesity drug market will help drive earnings growth.Signage is seen outside the Moody's Corporation headquarters in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 12, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly""Rising sales of...drugs treating cancer, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes/obesity will drive 2-4% earnings growth,"" Levesque said.Another bright spot, albeit smaller, is the uptick in COVID vaccines for the fall and winter, which will mostly benefit Pfizer (PFE), he said.""We could change our outlook to positive if we expect annual EBITDA growth above 4% over a future 12-18 months period. This could occur if there are material new product launches in under-treated diseases, if the impact of patent exposures declines, or if treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 see rising rather than weakening demand,"" Levesque wrote.Story continues""We could change our outlook to negative if our expectation for EBITDA growth falls below 0%.

Of course, many are aware of the sector’s increased volatility.However, targeting low-beta technology stocks could be a great solution if investors want to shield themselves from spooky price swings.Beta is a measure of a stock's systematic risk, or volatility, compared to the market as a whole. Generally, the benchmark is the S&amp;P 500, which has a beta of 1.0.Historically, stocks with a beta higher than 1.0 are more sensitive to the market’s movements, while those with a beta less than 1.0 are less susceptible.Three low-beta technology stocks – International Business Machines, NetEase, and Juniper Networks – could all be considered.Let’s take a closer look at each one.International Business MachinesIBM, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is an information technology (IT) company that’s been divided into two parts: IBM and Kyndryl. Shares currently yield a sizable 5% annually, crushing the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.IBM could entice value-focused investors, further reflected by the stock’s Style Score of “B” for Value. Shares currently trade at a 14.2X forward earnings multiple, beneath five-year highs of 16.5X in 2022.In addition, shares have recently seen buyers step up aggressively near the 50-day moving average in multiple instances, a level that the stock previously struggled against.NetEaseNetEase, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications, services, and other technologies for the Internet in China. The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions, with the trend particularly noteworthy for its current and next fiscal year.Story continuesThe company posted notably strong results in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by nearly 30% and delivering a modest revenue surprise. The market reacted well to the better-than-expected results, sparking an uptrend for shares.NetEase shares provide exposure to technology paired with a passive income stream; NTES shares currently yield 1.9%, with its payout growing by an impressive 30% over the last five years. And to top it off, the company’s 22% payout ratio resides on the sustainable side.Juniper NetworksJuniper Networks, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a leading provider of networking solutions and communication devices. The company has enjoyed modest positive earnings estimate revisions across several timeframes, with analysts in full agreement.The company is forecasted to grow steadily, with estimates calling for 20% earnings growth on 10% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY23). Looking ahead to FY24, projections allude to an additional 7% of earnings growth on 3% improved revenues.It may be worth keeping an eye out for JNPR’s next quarterly release expected on July 27th; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.55 indicates a 30% jump in earnings year-over-year. Our consensus revenue estimate sits at $1.4 billion, 12% higher than the year-ago quarter.The company’s revenue has recently seen an acceleration in growth.Bottom LineTargeting low-beta stocks can help shield investors against volatility, as these stocks are less susceptible to the market’s movements.For those who seek exposure to tech, all three low-beta stocks above fit the criteria.In addition, all three have seen their earnings estimates drift higher as of late, indicating favorable optimism among analysts.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

Kevin Mahn, Hennion &amp; Walsh CIO, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how future Fed rate hikes may impact the economy. Mahn also discusses important themes for investors in the second half of 2023.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, the Fed is also in focus here. Fed Chair Jay Powell saying overnight that he's monitoring the banking industry, quote, ""very carefully,"" while staying hawkish on the central bank's policy. At an event held by the Spanish central bank, Powell once again signaled that more rate hikes are likely necessary to get a better handle on inflation. We want to bring in Kevin Mahn, Chief Investment Officer at Hennion and Walsh.Kevin, it's great to see you again. So once again, Powell being very hawkish, as we could say, just in terms of the fact that what could maybe be necessary to get inflation under control. You're not buying it. You don't think we'll see another rate hike. Why?KEVIN MAHN: I don't think we should see another rate hike. In fact, I think the Fed should have hiked in May and then go away. We haven't even seen the full extent of the damage to the US economy of the first 500 basis points in rate hikes. We paused in June.Now, we're going to come back in July and hike again? What's changed from June to July? I recognize inflation is well above their target, but it's likely to remain well above their target for the next couple of years. So my concern is if they continue to raise rates aggressively, that's going to push the economy into a deeper, and perhaps more protracted, recession than would have otherwise occurred on its own.AKIKO FUJITA: And, yet, Kevin, since the FOMC meeting, we have heard the Fed Chair have a very consistent message, saying, essentially, the rate hikes are not over, even if they come at a moderated pace. So, I mean, what's your sense? Is he just dangling this over the market?Story continuesKEVIN MAHN: Well, it's--AKIKO FUJITA: Just the possibility?KEVIN MAHN: A good question, Akiko. Remember, there's three tools in the Fed's arsenal to help combat inflation. One is the Fed funds target rates, which they've now raised short term interest rates 500 basis points over the course of the last 15 months. Two is the size of their balance sheet, which they continue to shrink to the tune of about $95 billion per month. And their third tool is their rhetoric.And that rhetoric is in full force right now. So I'm still in a camp that, in all likelihood, they should be done with this rate hike cycle, although we may see one more 25 basis point hike between now and the year end. But regardless, we're at the end of this rate hike cycle. And I believe, in all likelihood, this time next year, we're going to be talking about rate cuts, not rate hikes.SEANA SMITH: This time next year, you think we'll be talking about rate cuts. And a lot of the expectations for rate cuts have been pushed out well into 2024. I want to go back, though, to what you said just a moment ago, and that was about recession. If we do see two more rate hikes, you mentioned the potential for a severe recession. How severe? What does that look like for the equity markets.?KEVIN MAHN: Well, let me put it this way-- 70% of our economic growth comes from consumer spending. We know that the consumer continues to spend. The labor market is relatively strong. But we also know that the consumer continues to dip into their personal savings and put more on their credit cards to help keep up these inflated prices.Last year alone, Seana, $180 billion worth of new credit card debt was put on the books, a record total. The average over the last 10 years is only $43 billion per year. We also know that credit card interest rates are near 21%, an all time high.If the Fed continues to raise interest rates, that's only going to make the cost of paying off that credit debt even higher. And that's going to slow down the economy.AKIKO FUJITA: So, Kevin, we've got a majority of S&amp;P 500 stocks now up on the start of the year. Can we expect more market breadth, though? We've been talking so much about the concentration in the tech plays, but it's starting to broaden out.KEVIN MAHN: It's starting to broaden out. But I will point out that if you look at the three major indexes at the midway point of the year-- NASDAQ up around 30% year to date, its best first half since 1983. The S&amp;P 500 up over 14%, well ahead all most major analyst predictions for the entire year of 2023. But the Dow up only 2% year to date, because the Dow hasn't been riding the coattails of those seven mega-cap technology stocks.We need to see more breadth in this rally to feel comfortable that this is, in fact, a bull market rally. I think we will see that during the second half of the year unless the Fed stays too aggressive.SEANA SMITH: And, Kevin, when we think about the themes, really, of the first half of the year, a lot of the focus has been on the Fed. And then when you take a look at the equity market, the outperformers there, a lot of that focus has been on AI. What do you think are going to be the key themes here are, the key focus for investors in the second half? Is that pretty much similar to what we've seen over the last six months?KEVIN MAHN: Similar, yes. So AI is certainly the new hot dot on Wall Street. But I would just recall back to the 2000s during the dotcom crash all of the hype and euphoria around dotcom and the internet back then. And I would just advise investors to be very cautious before jumping into those AI waters.Make sure you know who you're investing in. Make sure they're committed to AI. Make sure they're profitable. And make sure they have strong balance sheets. There's two ways you can play that, right?You can take the larger cap names-- the Microsofts, with their multibillion dollar commitment to OpenAI ChatGPT, or even IBM, who earlier this week announced a significant $4.6 billion acquisition of Apptio. Those are the bigger cap names. But let's look at some smaller cap names to we're really driving and using AI.ADRs, like Nice Limited or even Opera Limited-- Opera Limited has their own native web browser using AI based in Norway. And they also pay an attractive dividend. So there's going to be more than one winner to the AI race. So take your time, do your due diligence, blend US and international, and blend large cap and small cap. We think that's the diversification to play AI.AKIKO FUJITA: What's the checklist you think investors should be going for? Is it the profitability of these companies? Is it the valuations? You're looking at some of the smaller names, but what's to say those will have similar upside?KEVIN MAHN: I think you, first and foremost, need to look at those companies that have expertise and commitment to the AI space. In other words, they're not just suggesting that they're in AI or developing AI, but have a commitment to that space and the investment and the balance sheet to support that.You also have to look at valuations. As you point out, look at the strength of their balance sheet. Make sure they haven't taken on too much debt, which is going to impede their ability to be profitable.AI's got a long way to go. So consider AI in the concepts of other revolutionary technologies, such as robotics, the internet of things, cybersecurity, 5G, fintech. There are different ways that you can play the race in technology that we think can benefit growth oriented investors, not just for the balance of this year, but for the next decade.SEANA SMITH: Kevin, though, how much of that excitement is already priced into some of these larger names? You mentioned Microsoft, their position right now in AI given the partnership with OpenAI. How much of that, though, has already been priced in given the runup that we've seen?KEVIN MAHN: Yeah. Microsoft is one of the more fairly valued, and I'll put that in quotes, of the big cap names right now-- trading at a multiple, I believe, around 37. I know that doesn't sound like it's attractively valued, but relative to Nvidia, it certainly is. IBM, they are really investing a lot into this space right now.Seven acquisitions this year alone, 30 acquisitions since the new CEO took over. Plus, they have a dividend of over 5%. So I think there's much more opportunity ahead. But look for those companies with a commitment to the space, cash to spend, and also attractive balance sheet. IBM, Microsoft both fit that bill, but maybe there's even more growth in those smaller cap names.SEANA SMITH: All right, we will see what the performance looks like in the second half of the year. Kevin Mahn, thanks so much.KEVIN MAHN: My pleasure.]"

Of course, many are aware of the sector’s increased volatility.However, targeting low-beta technology stocks could be a great solution if investors want to shield themselves from spooky price swings.Beta is a measure of a stock's systematic risk, or volatility, compared to the market as a whole. Generally, the benchmark is the S&amp;P 500, which has a beta of 1.0.Historically, stocks with a beta higher than 1.0 are more sensitive to the market’s movements, while those with a beta less than 1.0 are less susceptible.Three low-beta technology stocks – International Business Machines IBM, NetEase NTES, and Juniper Networks JNPR – could all be considered.Let’s take a closer look at each one.International Business MachinesIBM, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is an information technology (IT) company that’s been divided into two parts: IBM and Kyndryl. Shares currently yield a sizable 5% annually, crushing the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIBM could entice value-focused investors, further reflected by the stock’s Style Score of “B” for Value. Shares currently trade at a 14.2X forward earnings multiple, beneath five-year highs of 16.5X in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, shares have recently seen buyers step up aggressively near the 50-day moving average in multiple instances, a level that the stock previously struggled against. This favorable price action has been illustrated in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNetEaseNetEase, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications, services, and other technologies for the Internet in China. The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions, with the trend particularly noteworthy for its current and next fiscal year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesThe company posted notably strong results in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by nearly 30% and delivering a modest revenue surprise. The market reacted well to the better-than-expected results, sparking an uptrend for shares.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNetEase shares provide exposure to technology paired with a passive income stream; NTES shares currently yield 1.9%, with its payout growing by an impressive 30% over the last five years. And to top it off, the company’s 22% payout ratio resides on the sustainable side.Juniper NetworksJuniper Networks, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a leading provider of networking solutions and communication devices. The company has enjoyed modest positive earnings estimate revisions across several timeframes, with analysts in full agreement.The company is forecasted to grow steadily, with estimates calling for 20% earnings growth on 10% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY23). Looking ahead to FY24, projections allude to an additional 7% of earnings growth on 3% improved revenues.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt may be worth keeping an eye out for JNPR’s next quarterly release expected on July 27th; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.55 indicates a 30% jump in earnings year-over-year. Our consensus revenue estimate sits at $1.4 billion, 12% higher than the year-ago quarter.The company’s revenue has recently seen an acceleration in growth, as we can see below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTargeting low-beta stocks can help shield investors against volatility, as these stocks are less susceptible to the market’s movements.For those who seek exposure to tech, all three low-beta stocks above – International Business Machines IBM, NetEase NTES, and Juniper Networks JNPR – fit the criteria.In addition, all three have seen their earnings estimates drift higher as of late, indicating favorable optimism among analysts.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

191,ac2ce354-e33e-31a6-be1c-b87e8f466e1f,GM,2023-06-30,Tesla Is Another Step Closer To Dominating The Charging Infrastructure,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-another-step-closer-dominating-174726765.html,1688060846,STORY,"['GM', 'F', '005380.KS', 'RIVN', 'TSLA', 'VLVLY']","[Volvo Cars is the latest EV maker to embrace Tesla’s North American charging standard in what seems to be an identical agreement as those previously made by General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) earlier this month. Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) and Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) have said they are considering following their footseps, but the Swedish automaker is the first European EV maker to formally commit to the NACS charging standard for its EVs sold in North America. These deals could give Elon Musk control of the charging infrastructure and the EV game as a whole, considering that this is the critical barrier to global EV adoption.Focus On The CustomerGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra described the advantages of the GM’s decision to adopt Tesla’s NACS as its customers will gain access to 13,000 most efficient chargers in the US. This decision will also help GM save $400 million.With EVs of above four automakers integrating Tesla’s NACS as of 2025, it is official that the efforts by the Biden administration to make the Combined Charging System (CCS) the dominant charging standard in the United States have failed, although Tesla’s technology is yet to be approved as a standard by SAE International. Upon the news on Tuesday afternoon, Tesla shares rose 3%. A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a federally funded research center, reported that the U.S will be installing 1.2 million public EV chargers by the end of the decade, without providing a breakdown of NACs and CCSs. The White House has confirmed that EV charging stations that use Tesla-standard plugs will be eligible for federal subsidies that translate to a financial support worth billions of dollars.The Charging Wars Win Also Comes With Risks For TeslaBy opening its charging network, Tesla became eligible for federal subsidies. But, this decision also brought in a portion of risk as the exclusive access to its fast supercharging network helped the EV king sells its cars to customers who did not want to wait behind Ford and GM vehicles. Musk has promised that GM, Ford, Rivian and Volvo customers will be treated like a Tesla customer and Tesla customers might not like that. Moreover, the reason why Tesla did so well is because it designed the whole system including the EV, the software that runs it and the charging hardware that powers it. Therefore, once other automakers like GM and Ford join its network, Tesla will no longer have absolute control. According to the Energy Department, Tesla has 19,700 charging ports across the United States located at about 1,800 stations but only 12,000 Tesla chargers will be open to Ford, GM, Rivian and now Volvo vehicles. Meanwhile, there are 10,500 CCS ports located at 5,300 stations so cars designed to use these plugs will be condemned with less reliable and slower charging.Story continuesAn Acknowledgment Of Tesla’s Know-howThese agreements are a recognition of Tesla’s know-how in terms of the charging infrastructure. The charging infrastructure chapter in the EV book, which is an essential milestone towards an all-electric future, will undoubtedly be written by the EV king himself.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

President and Fellows of Harvard, and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented in both cases, with Jackson, a Harvard Law alumna, having recused from voting on the case involving the college.Dozens of major corporations across various industries took interest in the case, including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), General Motors (GM), General Dynamics (GD), Dell, and Starbucks (SBUX).Those companies and nearly 40 others joined in an amicus brief contending that diversity in higher education ultimately helps their businesses by providing a diverse pool from which they can recruit.The supporters went on to argue that doing away with the policy would also weaken the military’s pool of eligible college-trained recruits.The Supreme Court in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The decisions overhaul a string of Supreme Court cases that address the role of race in institutionalized education, starting with the high court’s landmark 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. In Brown the court outlawed race-based segregation in public schools.The court acknowledged that its prior rulings permitted race-based admissions, saying it did so only ""within the confines of narrow restrictions.""University programs, the court said, must comply with strict scrutiny — the highest standard of review applied to constitutional questions. In writing for the majority, Roberts said the universities therefore ""may never use race as a stereotype or negative, and — at some point — they must end.""Story continuesThe challenger in both cases, Students for Fair Admissions, argued that affirmative action is illegal in public and private college settings because it penalizes equally qualified Asian-American and other minority applicants.The group, led by conservative activist Edward Blum, claimed that UNC’s consideration of race violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which bars government entities and public universities from discriminating based on race.Students walk through Harvard Yard on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)In its case against Harvard, a private university, the organization claimed that the school’s admissions policy violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bars race-based discrimination by organizations that take federal funds.Specifically, Students for Fair Admissions asked the court overturn its 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger, which held the University of Michigan's Law School could consider race as a factor in admissions, so long as its practice was narrowly tailored “to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.""Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who penned the majority opinion in Grutter, predicted that after 25 years, affirmative action would no longer be necessary to make colleges more diverse.""How will we know when the time has come?"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked about O'Connor's prediction during arguments in the UNC case.In concurring with the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that under the 14th Amendment, ""the color of a person’s skin is irrelevant to that individual’s equal status as a citizen of this nation.”In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it irrelevant in reality.""And having so detached itself from this country’s actual past and present experiences, the court has now been lured into interfering with the crucial work that UNC and other institutions of higher learning are do- ing to solve America’s real-world problems.""Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the company's earnings report.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: We're also watching the company behind those seasonings on your rub this weekend. McCormick. Shares of the company-- huh, yikes-- dipping today. Despite beating Wall Street expectations and raising its full year outlook sales, they grew 8% aided by higher prices here. And this was particularly interesting to look through for McCormick here because I don't know that I've ever been that enamored by some of the segments. I mean, it's pretty straightforward.They've got a consumer segment. They've got a flavor solution segment. I just wonder what you have to do to get the title of President of Flavor Solutions at McCormick. That would be kind of cool. But at the end of the day, the growth in that particular flavor solution segment, mighty flavorful for some investors here that move higher year over year and quite handily coming in at about $747.1 million versus the 670.7 that they saw a year prior there.And then the six month period also, continuing to show some significant growth increasing by about 12% from the second quarter of 2022 is kind of the round figure if you want to put it on--JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I was just looking up to see if there were any more headlines coming out of the conference call or anything because it's a little bit confusing why the stock is down. It raised its full year forecast for earnings. Sales just came in line with estimates and they didn't change their sales forecast for the year. So perhaps there's a little bit of disappointment bound up with that. I always have fond thoughts about McCormick because it's based in Hunt Valley Maryland, which is not so far from where I grew up.And periodically, if you drive by a McCormick facility, you will indeed smell the spice mix wafting through the air, which is kind of a fun thing.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Such a great word, wafting, especially when it comes to spices. A lot of people are going to be seeing those scents and flavors wafting through their backyards over the course of this next week.JULIE HYMAN: That's true.BRAD SMITH: But it could be on the volume decline as well. They had a 1% volume decline within the flavor solutions segment, also 1% volume decline from the company's strategic decisions to discontinue their low margin business in the consumer segment as well there. So perhaps there's a little bit more color that they're providing on that or a little bit more flavor they're providing on that--JULIE HYMAN: And just so all of our viewers know, Brad has now named himself President of Flavor Solutions.BRAD SMITH: At least in Slack. You can be anything you want to in Slack.JULIE HYMAN: It's true.BRAD SMITH: Including Alexis Ohanian's best friend. He is my profile picture in Slack for anybody who was wondering.]"
198,bd5b0d99-b306-38ad-abc6-8615fca6bdba,MKC,2023-06-30,McCormick (MKC) Raises Profit Guidance on Q2 Earnings Beat,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mccormick-mkc-raises-profit-guidance-135800508.html,1688047080,STORY,"['MKC', 'MKC-V', 'LW', 'NOMD']","[McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC reported strong second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein earnings and sales increased year over year and the former beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Results reflect continued strength in demand for the company’s compelling products, along with the efficient implementation of growth strategies. McCormick remains encouraged about growth due to sustained demand and a focus on optimizing the cost structure. Management raised its adjusted operating income and bottom-line guidance for fiscal 2023 while keeping the sales view unchanged.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of 60 cents per share increased 25% from 48 cents in the year-ago quarter. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents per share. The year-over-year increase was a result of elevated adjusted operating income, partly negated by increased interest costs and a higher adjusted effective tax rate.McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated QuoteThis global leader in flavor generated sales of $1,659.2 million, up 8% year over year. Constant-currency (cc) sales increased 10% on 11% growth from pricing actions, somewhat offset by a 1% decline in volumes. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,673 million.The volume decline stemmed from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of the Consumer business in Russia and a 1% decline from MKC’s decision to discontinue the low-margin business.McCormick’s gross profit margin expanded 310 basis points due to efficient pricing, an improved product mix and cost savings from the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement and Global Operating Effectiveness (“GOE”) programs. This was partly countered by escalated cost inflation.SG&amp;A expenses escalated year over year due to elevated employee incentive compensation expenses and increased distribution costs, partly offset by cost savings from the abovementioned programs.The adjusted operating income was $235 million, which jumped 35% year over year. At cc, the adjusted operating income rose 36%, backed by increased sales and gross margin, partly countered by a rise in SG&amp;A expenses.Story continuesSegment DetailsConsumer: Sales went up 5% to $912.1 million, while cc sales increased 7% due to a 9% rise in pricing, somewhat offset by a 2% drop in volumes. The volume decline resulted from the same factors that hurt the overall company volumes. Sales increased 3% in the Americas, 7% in the EMEA and 19% in the Asia/Pacific.Flavor Solutions: Sales in the segment advanced 12% to $747.1 million. On a cc basis, sales grew 13% due to solid pricing actions, partly negated by soft volumes. Flavor Solutions’ sales in the Americas grew 12%. Flavor Solutions’ sales in the EMEA rose by 9%. Sales in the Asia/Pacific market ascended 14% year over year.Financial UpdateMcCormick exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127.4 million, long-term debt of $4,117.6 million and total shareholders’ equity of $4,956.9 million. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2023, net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $394 million.Management expects to generate a robust cash flow in fiscal 2023, wherein it is likely to return a considerable part of its cash flow to shareholders via dividends.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceMcCormick anticipates fiscal 2023 to witness a solid underlying business performance, backed by sales growth. It expects the GOE Program and the lapping of pandemic-led hurdles to have a positive effect on the fiscal 2023 operating income, which is likely to be somewhat negated by the impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and a rise in employee incentive compensation costs.Management anticipates currency movements to have a minimal impact on fiscal 2023 net sales, operating income and earnings per share (EPS).For fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to increase 5-7% from the fiscal 2022 levels. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, are likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement.The adjusted operating income is likely to grow 10-12% now, up from the prior guidance of 9-11% growth. Management envisions fiscal adjusted EPS in the band of $2.60-$2.65 compared with the earlier view of $2.56-$2.61. The bottom-line view suggests growth from $2.53 recorded in fiscal 2022.The bottom-line growth is likely to be fueled by a solid operating performance, partly offset by increased interest expenses and a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 13.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.9%.Other Solid Staple StocksSome other top-ranked consumer staple stocks are Nomad Foods NOMD, The Chef’s Warehouse CHEF and Lamb Weston LW.Nomad Foods, a frozen food product company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Also, a focus on the savings program and pricing has been working well for the company amid cost-related headwinds.For fiscal 2023, Campbell Soup expects net sales and organic sales growth of 8.5-10%. Adjusted EBIT is forecast to be up 4.5-6.5%. Adjusted EPS is envisioned to be up 3.5-5% to come in the band of $2.95-$3.00.Solid Snacks BusinessCampbell Soup has been benefiting from its growing Snacks business. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, net sales in the company’s snack division rose 12% (also organically) to $1,121 million. The upside can be attributed to sales of CPB’s eight power brands, which rose 16%. Sales growth was fueled by a rise in cookies and crackers, specifically Goldfish crackers, Lance sandwich crackers and salty snacks like Kettle Brand potato chips, among others.The favorable net price realization contributed to the upside, which was partially offset by volume/mix declines. In-market dollar consumption increased 15% for the overall Snacks business due to power brands. The company expects to see continued strength in the Snacks business in fiscal 2024.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPricing Aids SalesCampbell Soup reported impressive third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and bottom lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and net sales increasing year over year. The results benefited from favorable net price realization and brand strength.Net sales of $2,229 million increased 5% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,219 million. Organic net sales grew 5% year over year. The upside can be attributed to favorable inflation-induced net price realization, somewhat offset by the soft volume/mix.Cost WoesIn the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Campbell Soup’s adjusted gross profit margin contracted 60 basis points (bps) to 30.9% on an unfavorable volume/mix, ongoing cost inflation and increased other supply-chain costs. Adjusted EBIT declined 2% to $313 million due to higher marketing and selling expenses and adjusted administrative expenses. As a percentage of sales, marketing and selling expenses came in at nearly 9%.The metric is likely to be at the lower end of the 9-10% range in fiscal 2023. Management’s fiscal 2023 outlook reflects planned investments in the fourth quarter. Shares of the company have declined 5.7% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 7.6%.Story continuesWrapping UpCampbell Soup is on track with efforts to counter inflation, such as supply-chain productivity enhancements and margin-improvement efforts. Through the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company generated $880 million in savings under its multi-year cost-saving program, including Snyder’s-Lance synergies. Management remains on track to deliver savings worth $1 billion by the fiscal 2025-end.These factors, along with Campbell Soup’s prudent investment and strategic efforts toward product innovation and brand building, bode well.Solid Staple StocksSome better-ranked consumer staple stocks are Nomad Foods NOMD, McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC and Lamb Weston LW.Nomad Foods, a frozen food product company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This is about a 4% increase from 2019 levels, the current record year for July 4th travel.The AAA estimates do not include Thursday, June 29, which the Federal Aviation Administration expects to be the busiest day of air travel during the holiday weekend.The U.S. Transportation Security Administration said it screened 2.7 million passengers on Thursday, up 32% from 2019.Last weekend, thunderstorms and failing equipment at an FAA facility in the Washington area created significant delays for air travelers on the U.S. East Coast.About 43,000 flights were delayed and over 7,700 were canceled between Saturday, June 24, and Thursday, June 29, according to flight tracking service FlightAware.United Airlines bore the brunt of the disruptions, with about 19% of its scheduled flights canceled and about 47% delayed.The Chicago-based carrier said its operations were beginning to see improvement. While the cancellations on Thursday were fewer than those in previous days in the week, United still scrapped 18% of its flights, data from FlightAware showed.The disruptions have left passengers fuming, with many United customers venting frustration on social media about long lines, delays in rebooking flights and misplaced luggage.Story continuesThe carrier has been apologizing to customers on Twitter for delays in responding to complaints, citing high call volumes.""It's all-hands-on-deck as our pilots get aircraft moving, contact center teams work overtime to take care of our customers, and our airport customer service staff works tirelessly to deliver bags and board flights,"" United said in a statement.U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has called the summer travel season a ""stress test"" for airline operations.""Nobody can control the weather, but it is important for airlines to create enough cushion in resilience in the system,"" Buttigieg told CNN.United CEO Scott Kirby, however, has blamed the Federal Aviation Administration for making the situation worse. In a staff memo, he said over 150,000 United customers were affected last weekend because of FAA staffing issues and its impact on managing traffic.Still, the airline has said it would be ""on track"" to restore operations for the holiday weekend when it expects 5 million people to fly with it. Its bookings are up about 12% from last year and have nearly rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.American Airlines expects nearly 3 million customers from Friday, June 30, through Tuesday, July 4, across more than 26,000 scheduled flights.Travel spending has held up nationwide, and air carriers expect strong results through 2023, which comes against a backdrop of U.S. consumer confidence rising in June to its highest level in nearly 1-1/2 years.AAA expects 43 million people will drive to their destinations, a 4% increase from 2019 levels.Other modes of travel still have not reached pre-pandemic levels. The travel group expects about 3 million people will travel by bus, cruise liner, or train over the long weekend, up 24% from last year but 5% lower than 2019 levels.(Reporting by Doyinsola Oladipo in New York and by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; editing by Deepa Babington and Jonathan Oatis)]"

They're [big customers] trying to work their balance sheets,"" noted General Mills chairman and CEO Jeff Harmening on the company's earnings call Wednesday.Added North America leader Jon Nudi: ""Retailers are focused on inventory. One of the things that we feel more confident about is being able to supply the business after all the supply disruptions in the last few years, then feel like they don't have to carry as much safety stock. In addition to that, obviously, the inventory is more expensive. So, working capital is a focus as well. As we look at the absolute levels of inventory, they are some of the lowest levels we've seen on record.""That tight inventory management — due to more sluggish consumer spending and higher carrying costs — by large cereal buyers such as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) has hurt General Mills' financial performance in two ways.First, the company has seen volume declines at its two most important lines of business: North America Retail (powered by cereal brands Cheerios, Lucky Charms, etc.) and Pet (Blue Buffalo).Fiscal fourth quarter volumes in each division dropped 8% and 2%, respectively. And full fiscal-year volumes at each division declined by 6% and 2%.With volumes under pressure and inflation still elevated, General Mills' gross profit margins took a hit for the quarter and fiscal year.Reported gross profit margins in the fiscal fourth quarter declined 180 basis points year on year to 34.4%. For the fiscal year, gross profit margins fell 110 basis points from a year ago to 32.6%.For a serving of perspective, inventory levels at Target plunged 16% year over year in the first quarter as the discounter cut stock across its store to improve margins. The vibe for manufacturers like General Mills wasn't much better at mega food buyer Walmart — inventory dropped 7% from the prior year in the first quarter.Story continuesRetailers aren't holding high levels of cereal inventory. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""Managing costs and inventory are two of the key controllables as we navigate an uncertain macroeconomic environment. We're improving inventory efficiency and merchandise flow and addressing placement in order to better serve customers, improve store in-stock levels, while also mitigating future risks if demand softens,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told analysts on a May earnings call.The cautious buying by retailers has General Mills cautiously planning its next 12 months financially.General Mills guided to 3% to 4% organic sales growth for its current fiscal year. It sees operating profits and EPS growing 4% to 6% year on year, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations.Wall Street is also viewing cereal stocks as akin to sour milk: Shares of General Mills and Kellogg are each down about 8% year to date.The S&amp;P 500 is up 14% on the year.""General Mills missed Q4 top-line expectations, driven mainly by unexpected NAR [national retailers] inventory reductions, which in turn raised more questions about the sector's go-forward growth profile. Despite more incremental margin expansion in FY’24 and FY’25 (driven partially by Pet), a lack of volume conviction as pricing laps increases uncertainty. Talk of increased promo activity and private label share gains, and a lack of clarity on F'24 volumes leave us sidelined,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Rob Dickerson in a client note.If there is any saving grace for the cereal industry, it is that major retailers at some point soon will have to rebuild inventory. After all, they run the risk of not having product on the shelves to meet consumer demand.""As we look at the absolute levels of inventory, there are some of the lowest levels we've seen on record. So, again, we don't believe that we can go much lower,"" Nudi added.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

209,8c686608-bd27-39c0-88f1-9ee141a61db0,ISRG,2023-06-30,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ISRG) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-130129908.html,1688043689.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 30% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Intuitive Surgical's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROEAt first glance, Intuitive Surgical seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 9.8% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for Intuitive Surgical's moderate 9.8% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 10% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Intuitive Surgical is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Intuitive Surgical Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Intuitive Surgical's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

210,16d13bdc-675c-3175-93c6-c7a245034554,CSX,2023-06-30,CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 75% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-corporation-nasdaq-csx-favoured-140018482.html,1688047218,STORY,['CSX'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, CSX's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyEvery investor in CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 75% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CSX. View our latest analysis for CSX ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CSX?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in CSX. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at CSX's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in CSX. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.8% and 6.4% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of CSXThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of CSX Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$188m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over CSX. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for CSX  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Tesla Inc. TSLA, Apple Inc. AAPL, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Carnival Corp. &amp; plc CCL.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:2 Cruise Stocks Boosting the S&amp;P 500 Rally in 1H 2023Astute investors and market pundits were expecting the stock market returns to take a beating this year primarily due to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening measures to tackle stubbornly high inflation.The consensus was that persistent interest rate hikes would lead to an economic slump, dragging stocks down. An array of regional bank failures had further heightened concerns about economic growth.However, the economy is still chugging along, with the broader S&amp;P 500 index well-poised to register its best half year in nearly two decades. This is because strength in the labor market overshadowed all kinds of headwinds, including the debt ceiling crisis.But it’s also true that big techs dominated the S&amp;P 500’s rally for most of the year, thanks to the unprecedented progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).Driven by the AI frenzy, some of the notable S&amp;P 500-listed tech titans such as NVIDIA Corp., Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc. saw their shares soar 181.4%, 108%, 53.6% and 45.7%, individually, so far this year, while the S&amp;P 500 Index surged 9.6% in the same period.Having said that, interestingly, two of the best-performing stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 have nothing to do with the AI boom, nor are they part of any revolutionary technologies such as self-driving cars. They are well-known for ferrying people across the globe on cruise ships.Story continuesThese cruise line stocks are Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Carnival Corp. &amp; plc, and their shares have surged 108.6% and 114.5%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.These cruise liners were among the hardest hit during the outbreak of the coronavirus that led to several travel restrictions. Their businesses became soft in the last two years, but with pent-up demand and travel curbs being lifted this year, Royal Caribbean and Carnival racked up solid gains. What’s more, their shares still trade below pre-pandemic levels, indicating more upside soon.Thanks to an uptick in both onboard sales and tickets, Royal Caribbean’s revenues almost tripled in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. The company swung from an operating loss to a profit in the first quarter and at present has high expectations for its full-year growth.Royal Caribbean’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is a whopping 162.9%. The company’s estimated earnings growth rate for next year is also a superb 44.9%.Notably, the company’s projected revenue growth rates for the current and next years are 48.7% and 13.3%, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RCL’s current-year earnings has moved up 44.8% over the past 60 days. Royal Caribbean has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Similarly, Carnival saw its revenues jump during the first half of this year as passenger booking for upcoming trips skyrocketed. Carnival notched an operating profit during the first six months of this year, in contrast to the operating loss it booked over the same period in 2022.Carnival’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is a remarkable 94%. The company’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next year is also a staggering 407.1%.At the same time, the company’s projected revenue growth rates for the current and next years are 72.7% and 10.1%, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCL’s current-year earnings has moved up 3.5% over the past 60 days. Royal Caribbean has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Also, its focus on the LeoVegas acquisition bodes well. However, the decline in visitation from pre-pandemic levels is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for now.Factors Driving GrowthSports betting and iGaming continue to be a major growth driver for the company. To this end, BetMGM continues to gain market share. As of March 2023, BetMGM achieved a market share of 28% in the iGaming and 17% in the U.S. sports betting space. During the first quarter, net gaming revenues from BetMGM came in at $476 million, up 76% from 2022 levels. Attributes such as robust player economics and a successful bonus optimization strategy added to the positives. Considering the positive market momentum and its unique and unparalleled online and offline offerings, the company is optimistic about long-term growth, with revenue expectations of $1.8-$2 billion in 2023. The company is confident about the improved design and functionality of the BetMGM app launch (of a single wallet) and omnichannel growth prospects.The company emphasizes on international expansion to drive growth. To this end, MGM Resorts made progress related to development plans in Japan and Dubai. It is working on its plans to expand its footprint in New York. The company is currently working through the RFA process and plans to submit the official application in summer 2023. The total spending expectation for its New York expansion is approximately $2 billion (including licensing fee). Going forward, the company intends to invest more than $2 billion into its properties to boost customer experiences and services. Also, the initiative is likely to support the needed technology platform and advanced analytics to better engage and service its guests and drive market share in its principal markets.Story continuesThe company is benefiting from a healthy demand for leisure time, loosened travel restrictions and significant contributions from the Las Vegas market. During the first quarter of 2023, Las Vegas Strip Resorts' net income came in at $2,176.2 million, up 31% year over year. The positive was brought on by an increase in business volume, travel and the opening of The Cosmopolitan. During the quarter, net revenues from regional operations reached $945.8 million, up 6% from prior-year quarter’s levels. The uptick was primarily driven by an increase in non-gaming business volume. MGM remains bullish on its domestic business outlook.The company also emphasized on the completion of the LeoVegas acquisition. The initiative supports the company’s expansion in international markets and online gaming and paves a path to drive its omnichannel strategy and generate incremental earnings between brick-and-mortar and online channels. On May 1, 2023, MGM internationally announced the first major investment by its subsidiary, LeoVegas, which entered into an agreement to acquire the majority of a game developer, Push Gaming. This investment will help the company expand its digital business on an international scale.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, shares of MGM Resorts have gained 46.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 45.5%.ConcernsAlthough the company resumed operations in most of its properties, traffic is still below pre-pandemic levels. In spite of sequential improvements, the company is cautious about the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment. Also, a rise in expenses is a headwind. Per our model, expenses for rooms, casino and food and beverage in 2023 are likely to increase 9.4%, 30.8% and 10.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMGM Resorts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are as follows:Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

The integration has brought about enhanced member benefits through status matching and point transfers between Radisson Rewards Americas and Choice Privileges.The expanded corporate customer base fueled group bookings, while the addition of seven Radisson Americas branded properties, including the Radisson Blu Plaza El Bosque Santiago in Chile and the Radisson Blu Vancouver Airport Hotel &amp; Marina in Canada, solidifies Choice Hotels' growth. Also, awarded contracts for eight additional Radisson Americas branded hotels and renewed contracts with 27 Radisson Americas branded hotels have positioned the company for continued success in the hospitality industry.Radisson Hotels Major Growth DriversThe company’s definitive agreement to acquire Radisson Hospitality for a purchase price of approximately $675 million and the integration of over 67,000 Radisson Hotels Americas rooms to the company’s portfolio helped it expand its presence in the Canadian, Mexican, Caribbean and other key Americas markets. This paves the path for 12% growth in global rooms number.During the first quarter of 2023, Radisson Americas brands experienced a significant boost in business travel bookings, up 9% year over year. The portfolio-wide RevPAR saw a robust growth of 11.2% compared with the previous year’s levels. The integration of Radisson Americas hotels into Choice Hotels systems is progressing well, with plans to merge loyalty programs by the end of the third quarter. The company is ahead of schedule in delivering adjusted EBITDA of over $60 million in 2023 and expects it to exceed $80 million in 2024. The acquisition of Radisson Americas is seen as a strategic move to leverage the company's momentum in the Upscale segment. It is anticipated to accelerate growth of the Cambria and Ascend brands while expanding the Radisson portfolio.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, shares of Choice Hotels have increased 2.2% against the industry’s 22.5% rise.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksChoice Hotels currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are: Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

The company has been capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement, which is expected to boost its performance. Continued business momentum, and robust traffic trends in stores and e-commerce bode well.Driven by these factors, lululemon reported the fifth straight quarter of a sales and earnings surprise in first-quarter fiscal 2023. The top and bottom lines also grew year over year on the back of continued business momentum and innovative products. Comp growth was aided by robust traffic trends in stores.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 38% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 7%. The stock also compared favorably with the Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 10.6% and the S&amp;P 500’s rally of 15.7%.An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LULU echoes a positive sentiment.

The company’s progress on this strategy, focused on doubling its revenues from $6.25 billion in 2021 to $12.5 billion by 2026, has been a key driver for the company. The strategy revolves around three key growth drivers, including product innovation, guest experience and market expansion.The five-year plan is likely to quadruple international sales, along with doubling digital and menswear sales. Also, the women’s business and North America operations are each anticipated to witness a low-double-digit CAGR in revenues, with store channel growth in the mid-teens in the next five years. As part of its strategy, the company intends to expand in China and Europe markets, with plans to open stores in Spain and Italy.For 2021-2026, total net revenues, on a five-year CAGR basis, are expected to be up 15%, with a slight expansion in the operating margin on an annual basis. lululemon anticipates bottom-line growth to outpace revenue growth. Although the 2026 targets seem too bold, the company believes that these are achievable due to its strong financial position.Additionally, LULU’s intent of capturing the growing online demand and ensuring a robust shopping experience through its accelerated e-commerce investments keeps it on track for growth. It has been investing in developing sites, building transactional omni functionality and increasing fulfillment capabilities.The company continues to strengthen omni-channel capabilities, such as curbside pickups, same-day deliveries and buy online pick up in store. It is enhancing its mobile app in a bid to offer the curbside pickup service and train its store associates to help customers speed up transactions. Free online digital educator service for people that can't make it into its stores bodes well.LULU is poised to benefit from increased store traffic as consumers return to stores for shopping. At the store level, comparable store sales increased 13% year over year and 16% on a constant-dollar basis in the fiscal first quarter. The company witnessed more than 30% traffic growth at stores.lululemon continues to be focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. It is leveraging its stores to facilitate omni-channel capabilities, including the buy online pickup in store and ship-from-store.The company has implemented several strategies to improve guest experience and reduce wait time. These include virtual waitlist, mobile POS and appointment shopping. These functionalities enable reducing the wait time to enter the store, and allow customers to complete some transactions like returns, exchanges and purchase of gift cards without entering the store. lululemon continues expanding its store base.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks are GIII Apparel Group GIII, Bluegreen Vacations BVH and Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL.GIII Apparel sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

An array of regional bank failures had further heightened concerns about economic growth.However, the economy is still chugging along, with the broader S&amp;P 500 index well-poised to register its best half year in nearly two decades. This is because strength in the labor market overshadowed all kinds of headwinds, including the debt ceiling crisis.But it’s also true that big techs dominated the S&amp;P 500’s rally for most of the year, thanks to the unprecedented progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).Driven by the AI frenzy, some of the notable S&amp;P 500-listed tech titans such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Tesla Inc TSLA, Amazon.com, Inc AMZN and Apple Inc AAPL saw their shares soar 181.4%, 108%, 53.6% and 45.7%, individually, so far this year, while the S&amp;P 500 Index surged 9.6% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHaving said that, interestingly, two of the best-performing stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 have nothing to do with the AI boom, nor are they part of any revolutionary technologies such as self-driving cars. They are well-known for ferrying people across the globe on cruise ships.These cruise line stocks are Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Carnival Corporation &amp; plc CCL, and their shares have surged 108.6% and 114.5%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThese cruise liners were among the hardest hit during the outbreak of the coronavirus that led to several travel restrictions. Their businesses became soft in the last two years, but with pent-up demand and travel curbs being lifted this year, Royal Caribbean and Carnival racked up solid gains. What’s more, their shares still trade below pre-pandemic levels, indicating more upside soon.Story continuesThanks to an uptick in both onboard sales and tickets, Royal Caribbean’s revenues almost tripled in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. The company swung from an operating loss to a profit in the first quarter and at present has high expectations for its full-year growth.Royal Caribbean’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is a whopping 162.9%. The company’s estimated earnings growth rate for next year is also a superb 44.9%.Notably, the company’s projected revenue growth rates for the current and next years are 48.7% and 13.3%, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RCL’s current-year earnings has moved up 44.8% over the past 60 days. Royal Caribbean has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Similarly, Carnival saw its revenues jump during the first half of this year as passenger booking for upcoming trips skyrocketed. Carnival notched an operating profit during the first six months of this year, in contrast to the operating loss it booked over the same period in 2022.Carnival’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is a remarkable 94%. The company’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next year is also a staggering 407.1%.At the same time, the company’s projected revenue growth rates for the current and next years are 72.7% and 10.1%, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCL’s current-year earnings has moved up 3.5% over the past 60 days.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Piper Sandler upgraded Micron Technology (MU) to Neutral from Underweight with a price target of $70, up from $45, following quarterly results. The upgrade is primarily based on improving end market inventory conditions with a potential improvement in volumes and pricing in the second half of 2023, the firm says. [Read more] Canaccord upgraded Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $19, up from $12. With the NASH indication out of the picture, shares of Intercept are now valued purely on the company's Ocaliva commercial operation, and there is now no clinical risk associated with the story, the firm says. [Read more] Susquehanna upgraded Schneider National (SNDR) to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $33, up from $29. The Q2 earnings reports ""should be deeply challenging"" for truckload-levered transports, but this will likely mark the bottom, the firm says. [Read more] Barrington upgraded Opko Health (OPK) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $2 price target after the company and partner Pfizer (PFE) announced that the FDA had approved Ngenla, a long-acting human growth hormone indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged three years and older who are experiencing growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone. [Read more]Morgan Stanley upgraded Freyr Battery (FREY) to Overweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $13. The firm sees the next six months as a ""catalyst window for unlocking shareholder value."" [Read more] Top 5 Downgrades:KeyBanc downgraded Disney (DIS) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target. The company's Domestic Parks expectations ""appear high"" and its direct-to-consumer subscriber growth has stalled, the firm says. [Read more] Credit Suisse downgraded Pfizer (PFE) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $40, down from $47. As Pfizer enters a ""period of uncertainty and limited pipeline catalysts,"" there is greater opportunity for growth among other U.S. major pharma stocks, the firm says. [Read more] Loop Capital downgraded RH (RH) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged $300 price target. The firm notes that the rating change is driven by the stock's current valuation rather than a more bearish view of the company's fundamentals. [Read more] Loop Capital downgraded ContextLogic (WISH) to Sell from Hold with a price target of $6, down from $7. The firm, which has lowered its sales expectations, says the company has ""consistently missed consensus for revenues,"" and it doesn't see a change this quarter. [Read more] UBS downgraded Symbotic (SYM) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $40, up from $34. The firm sees a more balanced risk/reward following the 230% year-to-date stock appreciation, though UBS remains supportive on Symbiotic's growth prospects and warehouse automation tech leadership. [Read more] Top 5 Initiations:Berenberg initiated coverage of Atlassian (TEAM) with a Hold rating and $150 price target. With the shares trading at 10.5-times estimated 2023 sales, a Buy rating would entail pricing in growth expectations for fiscal 2023 and 2024 that may be difficult to meet, given the current macro environment, or sizeable margin expansion, which is unlikely, the firm says. [Read more]Guggenheim initiated coverage of Wingstop (WING) with a Neutral rating and no price target. The firm believes material upside to the current share price would require assuming a discount rate above where it is comfortable in the current interest rate environment. [Read more] Piper Sandler a initiated coverage of TJX (TJX) with an Overweight rating and $110 price target. The off-price channel has both near-and long-term secular trends that make it one of the most attractive sectors in apparel retail, the firm says.

Although many still fear that the economy might slip into a recession, a large number of people believe that such a situation could be avoided.This has led to consumer confidence climbing up substantially in June. The Conference Board said on Jun 27 that consumer confidence rose to 109.7 in June from May’s revised reading of 102.5 and surpassed analysts’ expectations of a reading of 104. June’s reading is also the highest since January 2022.Also, the Conference Board’s survey showed that consumers’ expectations for 12-month inflation fell to 6% in June from 6.1% in the prior month. This is the lowest reading since the end of 2020.The Expectations Index, which shows consumers’ outlook for business, income and labor market conditions over the upcoming six months, also rose to 79.3 from May’s reading of 71.5, its highest level in more than a year.More importantly, the Present Situation Index, which indicates consumers’ assessment of the present business and labor market conditions, jumped to 155.3 in June from 148.9 in May.The survey also showed that an impressive 30% of the respondents believe that the financial situation of their families will be “better” over the next six months against 14% who fear it will be “worse.”Understandably, the present economic scenario is giving people the much-required confidence. The U.S. labor market is still resilient, which is boosting household confidence. The economy added 339,000 jobs in May, indicating that the labor market is still going strong. At the same time, the jobless rate is below the 4% level, which means people are feeling secure about their jobs.Both consumer price and producer price inflation declined in May, indicating that inflation has slowed. This prompted the Fed to keep interest rates unaltered.Story continuesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in consumer discretionary stocks.Our ChoicesTherefore, from an investment perspective, we have identified four stocks from this sector that are likely to gain on the rebound in consumer confidence.

It may not have been easy to hold on to MAR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Marriott International's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Marriott International's main business drivers.Marriott International Inc. is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising, after the spin-off of its timeshare business into a publicly-traded company in Nov 2011.During first-quarter 2023, the company added 79 new properties (11,015 rooms) to its worldwide lodging portfolio. At the end of first-quarter 2023, Marriott's development pipeline totaled 3,060 hotels, with approximately 502,000 rooms. Nearly 200,000 rooms were under construction.As of Mar 31, 2023, the company operated, franchised and acted as a licensor of hotels and timeshare properties to more than 8,400 properties across 138 countries and territories under 30 brand names.The company has grouped its brand portfolio into three groups:Luxury: The company’s classic luxury hotel brands include JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, and St. Regis. Meanwhile, Marriott’s distinctive luxury hotel brands comprise W Hotels, The Luxury Collection, EDITION, and Bulgari.Premium: The company’s classic premium hotel brands include Marriott Hotels, Sheraton, Delta Hotels, Marriott Executive Apartments, and Marriott Vacation Club. Moreover, its distinctive premium hotel brands comprise Westin, Renaissance, Le Méridien, Autograph Collection, Gaylord Hotels, Tribute Portfolio and Design Hotels.Select: The company’s classic select hotel brand include Courtyard, Residence Inn, Fairfield by Marriott, SpringHill Suites, Four Points, TownePlace Suites, and Protea Hotels. Meanwhile, Marriott’s distinctive select hotel brands comprise Aloft, AC Hotels by Marriott, Element, and Moxy.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Marriott International a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $4,400.79, or a 340.08% gain, as of June 29, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 172.48% and gold's return of 48.84% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MAR.Shares of Marriott have outperformed the industry in the past three months. The company reported impressive first-quarter 2023 results. Earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. The upside was backed by solid demand across all the customer segments and expansion plans. During the first quarter, a significant acceleration was observed in the International market with RevPAR growth of 63% year over year, driven by strong demand after travel restrictions were lifted, throughout Asia Pacific. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased in the past 60 days. Marriott anticipates the International comp systemwide RevPAR to grow 22-25% for 2023. However, constrained RevPAR in China is a concern.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.88%, and there have been 10 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

230,c592d170-3257-314c-834f-53cfa0c5cd73,VZ,2023-06-30,Verizon upgrades network for Spokane customers,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-upgrades-network-spokane-customers-130000457.html,1688043600,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCRecent upgrades result in testing outcomes that show customers have the best experience on the Verizon networkSPOKANE, Wash., June 29, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Spokane, WA. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Spokane include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. With the recent deployments and upgrades, more than 50% of people in Spokane now have access to 5G service from Verizon. Verizon Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using its C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage. Most notably, Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service has recently expanded to areas near South Hill, Kendal Yards, and downtown Spokane (including areas that will serve Hoopfest, Spokane's annual three-on-three basketball tournament) as well as areas of Spokane Valley, Liberty Lake, Post Falls, and Coeur D'Alene.Spokane’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon engineers are using 100 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Spokane will be able to take advantage of twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Spokane. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Spokane area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data. Story continues“We know customers count on us, and we work every day to ensure we deliver for them. Our reliable, secure network connects families, friends, homes and businesses in Spokane, NY with best-in-class 5G Ultra Wideband technology,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powers:Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with countless opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Spokane, WA customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers having the best experience on the Verizon network in Spokane, WA, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Spokane, Verizon came in first place for overall network performance, and in fact was unbeaten in every single category measured including reliability, accessibility, speed and call, text and data performance. Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Spokane with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 53% since last year in the market.*Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Spokane, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more.

And if they did, no way did they anticipate the hype around the nascent technology and explosive stock price gains.Yet here we stand with the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 (think: Nvidia, Microsoft, Google) now accounting for about 22% of the overall index thanks to these big gains, the most concentrated the index has been since at least 1980, Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells me.It's wild.morning brief imageAnother surprise was the banking crash several months ago.Who in the world expected a wave of all-out bank busts. Credit Suisse owned by UBS? Crazy!Where the surprises haven't come from is on the economic front, which is interesting in light of the Fed's aggressive rate hikes making their way through the housing, auto and consumer sectors.The economy has chugged along — albeit at a slow pace — but hasn't shocked the markets.But those lack of economic surprises could change soon as the Fed eyes potentially two more rate increases this year. Said surprises may start on the jobs front, argues veteran Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner.""We forecast a significant slowdown in monthly non-farm payroll growth this year that falls below the 90k replacement rate in 4Q23, and bottoms in January 2024 at 40k before gradually improving to 72k/month in 2024,"" Zentner said in a note this week that deserved a lot more attention than it got (hence, we are discussing it in these pages).Is a negative jobs report lurking? (Morgan Stanley)Zentner thinks we could get the first negative headline payrolls figure for this cycle in September.Story continuesIf it were to happen, it would mark a big-time slowdown from the 300,000 average pace of job creation we have gotten year to date.The markets will unlikely take a negative headline jobs number well, Zentner contends. Investor attention may quickly shift to renewed fears of a recession at the hands of an inflation-fighting Federal Reserve.""On a negative payroll print this year, risk-off sentiment in financial markets may soar, especially as investors remain on recession watch despite the strengthening soft-landing story,"" Zentner says.The Fed may not be so quick to act by cutting rates on a drop in jobs, warns Zentner.Another thing investors won't want to hear.Written off surprises for 2023?

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.58 a share 27 days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 26, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.58 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.51 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Agnico Eagle Mines has an Earnings ESP of 13.17%.AEM is part of a big group of Basic Materials stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Air Products and Chemicals (APD) as well.Air Products and Chemicals, which is readying to report earnings on August 3, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Cummins' (NYSE:CMI) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Cummins is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$3.2b ÷ (US$31b - US$12b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Cummins has an ROCE of 17%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Machinery industry average of 11% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Cummins roceIn the above chart we have measured Cummins' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Cummins.So How Is Cummins' ROCE Trending?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 17% and the business has deployed 55% more capital into its operations. Since 17% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesOur Take On Cummins' ROCEThe main thing to remember is that Cummins has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 109% return they've received over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Cummins, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.While Cummins may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Any ongoing filming would have to halt if actors also strike.Leaders of SAG-AFTRA and the WGA say the entertainment industry has changed dramatically with the rise of streaming television and the emergence of new technology such as generative AI, which they fear could be used to write scripts or create digital actors.Some actors have spoken publicly of their support of a walkout.Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of the new ""Indiana Jones"" movie, noted that she was already on strike as a member of the WGA. ""I'm on the edge of my seat hoping that SAG will follow suit and stand up in support of the writers, and just really hope we can get this sorted,"" Waller-Bridge said in an interview with Reuters at an ""Indiana Jones"" premiere in London.SAG-AFTRA already voted to give its leaders the authority to call a work stoppage if talks break down before their contract expires on Friday night.Story continues""I think we need the actors to go on strike so that it all could get worked out,"" filmmaker and actor Judd Apatow told Reuters. ""All these issues affect everybody.""The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which negotiates on behalf of the studios, had no comment on the ongoing talks with SAG-AFTRA.With the writers, the AMPTP said it had offered ""generous"" pay increases but could not agree to all of the writers' demands. The studios and the WGA have not held talks since the writers' strike began on May 2.The WGA walkout is hitting caterers, prop suppliers and other small businesses that generate a large portion of their income from Hollywood productions. The last writers' strike in 2007 and 2008 cost the California economy an estimated $2.1 billion.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Hanna Rantala and Sarah Mills in London; Editing by Mary Milliken and Rosalba O'Brien)]"

Yahoo Finance Live compares Disney's content offerings to the rest of the budding sports streaming landscape.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: But some of us probably are subscribed to Disney Plus, which brings me to my story. I'm looking at shares of Disney. They're pretty flat today following a downgrade earlier this morning from KeyBanc Capital. Now, KeyBanc downgraded the stock, citing five areas of concern. And I want to focus in on one of those, being ESPN.KeyBanc saying that it's going to be materially harder for Disney to convert ESPN to a fully over-the-top streaming service, because not a lot of people are going to want to pay the high price for that subscription. KeyBanc saying that they did a survey for consumer interest. About 25% said that they would not be willing to pay at all for a pure sports streaming service. 46% said they would be willing to pay $10 or less a month. And then only 26% would pay $20 or more.But here's a problem here guys is that sports, Disney allocates about 30% of its $30 billion budget to sports. So KeyBanc said that they really need to break even with 25 million subscribers at $33 a month. And given that data, that ARPU number doesn't really seem likely.JOSH SCHAFER: I-- here's the thing. I think people can't really get there when they're doing that survey right now, because their favorite team isn't behind a paywall. If you get to a point where ESPN actually put all of live sports behind a paywall, I think there's a lot of people-- I think there might be 25 million people that would pay $30 for that.If they have every NBA game, they have a lot of NBA games-- I mean, Turner Broadcasting has them, too. But they have a lot of NBA games. They have some NBA playoff games. People are going to pay for that. They have the NHL, people are going to pay for that.Story continuesNow, of course, Disney is paying a lot of money for those deals. But I think if you start putting real live sports that people actually watch, not ESPN three-- a college football team that I might watch, but I watch a lot of college football. When you start putting really popular things behind the paywall, I think sentiment would change.SEANA SMITH: And also, just take a step back, and you're a massive sports fan. How expensive it could potentially to be a sports fan, right? Because if you're paying-- if it ends up being $30 a month here for ESPN, for that streaming service. And you're also paying for Prime, because you want to see the Thursday Night Football games. And you're also paying for Apple because they have baseball and soccer. It's going to start adding up. So I think that is a barrier here for ESPN to be able to charge 30 bucks, maybe they could get away with 20 bucks. And then they would be able to significantly increase their subscriber numbers given the fact that it's not going to be available on cable.But I think that this is just interesting in terms of what the roadmap looks like for Disney ahead, because it really complicates what exactly Iger has said. And he has said that he does see ESPN turning to fully-- fully accessible on streaming. But how they get there in a profitable way that makes sense given all the costs that they're putting into this really complicates all that math.JOSH SCHAFER: And it should have something to do with contracts, too, right? Because I'd imagine a lot of the contracts would currently have to change, because right now, I don't think they can put some of that stuff on streaming. So then it would take a couple of years before we even kind of get to this point. But it is a good point of like, who creates the bundle again? You kind of just want a sports bundle again, right?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Realistically.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think of how much YouTube TV costs. And I know YouTube TV, it's sort of a cable replacement. It doesn't just have sports. I watch ""Bravo"" on YouTube TV. So I don't have it solely for sports. I share it with my family. I know my brothers use it primarily for sports. They charge a little less than 75 bucks a month. So maybe you could argue that 30 bucks isn't that bad for consumers.If you have the majority of sports in that one service, I think eventually people are going to want to just go to one place to watch all their sports. How we get there, when we get there, I'm not sure. Clearly, right now, it's very fragmented. But eventually, I think we're going to see a lot of--JOSH SCHAFER: We should create cable networks.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, right? This is where we're going back to the cable bundles.JOSH SCHAFER: I never-- I've never had one of those. That'd be cool.SEANA SMITH: I do. I pay a heck of a lot. And then add on all those--[INTERPOSING VOICES]We're paying way too much. It's way beyond our budget.]"

We worry the 'tough comps' are not properly reflected in consensus,"" the analyst wrote.He added the company's new labor contract in Florida, coupled with the accelerated depreciation of the Starcruiser hotel, will further pressure margins.FILE - A statue of Walt Disney and Micky Mouse stands in front of the Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux, File)On the streaming side, KeyBanc expects further losses from Disney+ and Hulu as growth tapers off amid escalating competition.Disney stock saw its biggest decline in six months after the media giant reported Disney+ shed 4 million subscribers in its fiscal second quarter following recent price hikes.ESPN remains another murky area for the company. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported Disney is currently laying the groundwork to transform ESPN into a fully over-the-top streaming service — something Disney CEO Bob Iger has said will happen.Story continues""At this point, [ESPN+] is what I call a flanker business or brand to the main ESPN brand,"" Iger said in March. ""Down the road, at some point, I think it's inevitable...[ESPN] will become a direct-to-consumer business.""But Nispel noted recent Keybanc survey data shows a ""low willingness to pay.""""Who's going to pay $30+/month for ESPN? Not many,"" the analyst wrote. ""From our survey work, we found consumer interest in sports is relatively high in linear, though willingness to pay in streaming is low: we found &gt;25% of subscribers would not be willing to pay for a pure sports streaming service, 46% of subscribers would be willing to pay &lt;$10/month, and 26% would pay &gt;$20/month.""Alexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

""We are available to support customers in every step of their solar journey.""The number of ComEd residential and business customers who have installed solar systems has grown from 837 at the end of 2016 to 41,270 customers through May of this year. Additionally, there are more than 82 community solar projects in ComEd’s northern Illinois service territory and the company estimates there will be more than 100 projects serving more than 25,000 customers by the end of this year. Community solar is a popular option for customers whose roofs are not suited for rooftop solar, do not own their roofs, or want to combine rooftop solar with community solar.Not every home is well suited for rooftop solar, which is why ComEd offers a tool to help customers get the facts to decide if rooftop solar is right for them. The interactive rooftop solar calculator evaluates a roof’s solar energy potential, including factors such as roof direction, slope and shading. To ensure that rooftop solar estimates will reflect a customers’ energy requirements, the calculator allows customers to include future electric usage that would result from electric vehicle charging or the replacement of gas appliances with electric alternatives. Customers receive a personalized report that combines current and estimated future energy usage and includes the number of solar panels required to meet their energy needs, project costs, rebates, incentives and payback period.Story continuesThe calculator also provides information on a rebate program that is newly available to residential customers through CEJA. It offers a rebate of $300 per kilowatt for an eligible distributed generation facility, such as a private solar system, and a rebate of $300 per kilowatt hour for an associated energy storage device. Customers are able to compare their potential payback with and without incorporating the rebate, enabling them to see how it would impact their estimated payback period.ComEd also has launched a new community solar calculator, which provides estimated savings based on current energy usage. Community solar allows all ComEd customers to subscribe to a solar energy ""farm"" of solar panels owned by an independent developer and earn credits on their monthly ComEd bills for their portion of the energy produced by the project.The rooftop and community solar calculators provide information on customer assistance programs, including Illinois Solar for All, which helps customers who may qualify for more affordable solar installation or community solar subscriptions through state incentives. CEJA, which was enacted in 2021, increases funding for Illinois Solar for All from $30 million to $70 million annually.The multi-year grid and rate plans ComEd filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) earlier this year outline the proposed investments required to support this rapid expansion of renewable energy and help ensure equitable access to the benefits of clean energy under CEJA. The plans align with ComEd 2030, the company's recently announced vision for a carbon-free energy future that will benefit all communities and meet customers' changing needs for the rest of this decade and beyond.To learn more about ComEd’s new and improved solar calculators visit: https://secure.comed.com/MyGeneration/About ComEdComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Energias de Portugal is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Exelon has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that EDPFY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.EDPFY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.98, while EXC has a forward P/E of 16.98. We also note that EDPFY has a PEG ratio of 1.23. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. EXC currently has a PEG ratio of 2.54.Another notable valuation metric for EDPFY is its P/B ratio of 1.18. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, EXC has a P/B of 1.59.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, EDPFY holds a Value grade of B, while EXC has a Value grade of C.EDPFY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than EXC, so it seems like value investors will conclude that EDPFY is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, many are aware of the sector’s increased volatility.However, targeting low-beta technology stocks could be a great solution if investors want to shield themselves from spooky price swings.Beta is a measure of a stock's systematic risk, or volatility, compared to the market as a whole. Generally, the benchmark is the S&amp;P 500, which has a beta of 1.0.Historically, stocks with a beta higher than 1.0 are more sensitive to the market’s movements, while those with a beta less than 1.0 are less susceptible.Three low-beta technology stocks – International Business Machines, NetEase, and Juniper Networks – could all be considered.Let’s take a closer look at each one.International Business MachinesIBM, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is an information technology (IT) company that’s been divided into two parts: IBM and Kyndryl.

261,2c805ea2-d897-37ec-b7f6-c9cef52d59d1,JNPR,2023-06-30,"InterDigital, Inc. (IDCC) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interdigital-inc-idcc-hit-52-131505365.html,1688044505,STORY,"['IDCC', 'JNPR']","[Shares of InterDigital (IDCC) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 13.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $94.65 in the previous session. InterDigital has gained 90.3% since the start of the year compared to the 36.1% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 1.6% return for the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 4, 2023, InterDigital reported EPS of $4.21 versus consensus estimate of $0.62 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 107.78%.For the current fiscal year, InterDigital is expected to post earnings of $8.07 per share on $522.88 million in revenues. This represents a 163.19% change in EPS on a 14.22% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.61 per share on $442.84 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -30.45% and -15.31%, respectively.Valuation MetricsInterDigital may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.InterDigital has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 11.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 14.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 16.2X versus its peer group's average of 11.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.84. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, InterDigital currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if InterDigital meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though InterDigital shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does IDCC Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of IDCC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR). JNPR has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Comcast (CMCSA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.99 a share, just 28 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 27, 2023.CMCSA has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.22%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.99 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.98.CMCSA is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Boyd Gaming (BYD) as well.Boyd Gaming, which is readying to report earnings on July 25, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.62 a share, and BYD is 26 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boyd Gaming is $1.56, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.55%.Story continuesCMCSA and BYD's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

263,f2bc71b2-13d9-3d0d-9281-0032b6404663,CMCSA,2023-06-30,Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporation-cmcsa-attracting-investor-130006484.html,1688043606,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Comcast (CMCSA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this cable provider have returned +5.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Cable Television industry, to which Comcast belongs, has gained 5.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Comcast is expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.71 points to a change of +1.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.11 indicates a change of +10.8% from what Comcast is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Comcast is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Comcast, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.29 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $120.63 billion and $123.48 billion estimates indicate -0.7% and +2.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryComcast reported revenues of $29.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $0.92 for the same period compares with $0.86 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +15%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Comcast is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Comcast. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After gaining in early trading, the shares declined as much as 5.2% to $63.55.Though Micron’s customers are working through a pile of excess inventory, the company isn’t predicting a rapid return to growth in 2023. PC shipments are expected to decline by a “low double-digit” percentage from a year ago, slumping to a level that’s below where that market was before the pandemic. The smartphone industry will contract by a percentage in the mid-single digits from a year ago, Micron predicted.On the plus side, Micron said it has passed the low point of the current downturn.Micron has no plans to write down any more inventory — something that’s weighed heavily on its profitability — in the current quarter, according to Manish Bhatia, an executive vice president and head of global operations.“The worst is behind us — the revenue trough is behind the industry,” he said in an interview. “It’s really about the rate and pace of the recovery now.”But the situation in China — where the government has decided that Micron’s products are a security risk — remains a major cloud. Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra called it “a significant headwind that is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery.”Read More: What Wall Street Is Saying About Micron’s ProspectsStory continuesMicron is projecting a loss of about $1.12 to $1.26 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter, worse than the estimated $1.10 loss. Sales will be as much as $4.1 billion in the period, compared with an average analyst estimate of $3.87 billion.In the three months ended June 1, Micron’s revenue declined 57% to $3.75 billion. The company had a loss of $1.43 a share, excluding certain items. That compares with an average estimate of a loss of $1.59 a share and sales of $3.69 billion.Like many of its peers, Micron has suffered a collapse in orders for its products after sluggish demand for smartphones and personal computers led to a buildup of inventory. But investors have been betting on a comeback. The shares had gained 34% this year before Thursday.Micron’s chips, which help store and handle information, are particularly vulnerable to swings in demand because memory products are directly interchangeable and traded like commodities.Rapid fluctuations in the balance between supply and demand can leave producers selling the components for less than they cost to make. Micron is also up against formidable rivals in South Korea: Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc.Prior to disruptions caused by the pandemic, Micron’s management had argued that the spread of memory chips to more markets would help prevent another boom-and-bust cycle. And even now, Mehrotra and his team maintain that once this current set of unusual circumstances is over – the global pandemic, a war in Europe and supply chain disruptions — the industry will return to long-term profitable growth.But unlike its Korean competitors, Micron has also fallen prey to the geopolitical rivalry between China and the US. The Cybersecurity Administration of China has probed the company and barred its chips from critical infrastructure.The Boise, Idaho-based company has warned that about half of its sales tied to China-headquartered clients may be affected by the probe. That represents a “low-double-digit percentage” of its global revenue.Mehrotra said on a conference call with analysts the situation in China remains “uncertain and fluid.”“Micron is working to mitigate this impact over time and expects increased quarter-to-quarter revenue variability,” he said. The company’s “long-term goal” is to retain its global market share, Mehrotra said.Several of Micron’s customers are being contacted by officials as part of the China investigation, which was announced earlier this year. Micron’s revenue with businesses based in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors, accounts for about a quarter of the company’s total.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Air Jordan Drop So Hot It Blew Up an Alleged $85 Million Ponzi SchemeA Pop-Up Concert Company Gives Bands a Place to Perform, and 70% of the ProfitHow a Prison Gang Inspired by Hollywood Heists Stole $23 MillionEBT Skimmers Are Draining Millions of Dollars From the Neediest AmericansHow a $100 Cheetah Cub Becomes an Illegal $50,000 Status Symbol©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Prologis (PLD) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.71 a share, just 19 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 18, 2023.PLD has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.85%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.71 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.68.PLD is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Extra Space Storage (EXR) as well.Extra Space Storage, which is readying to report earnings on August 1, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.16 a share, and EXR is 33 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Extra Space Storage is $2.15, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.35%.Story continuesPLD and EXR's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)There is no doubt that UPS Inc.’s labor costs will rise once the Teamsters union ratifies the next five-year contract, which at this writing is still being negotiated. And there is little doubt that UPS will do what it can to recoup what could be a significant increase in its expense tab.It already is doing so, according to Steven Bergan, president of GLS, a Western regional carrier that recently expanded to four East Coast and Midwest markets with individual partners. “UPS is out being equally aggressive about using their volume rebate programs to demand volumes and threaten customers with major rate increases despite shippers looking to diversify in the event of a UPS (NYSE: UPS) strike,” Bergan said. Parcel customers typically get rebates based on volume tenders; conversely, they can lose those rebates if they divert certain volume levels elsewhere.“It’s a bit heavy-handed in my opinion that a shipper’s parcel vendor would have the guts to go in to a customer, threaten major rate increases if volume gets pulled away, even when that same parcel vendor may not show up next week due to a strike, and there’s zero the shipper can recover if and when that happens,” Bergan said. In addition, UPS is “using this positioning to set up for next year’s rate increases and volume commitment demands,” he said.Taking up rates and other fees in the belief that the marketplace will absorb them is not a wise assumption, said Josh Dunham, co-founder and CEO of the Reveel Group, a consultancy.“With the slowing economy and the rate increases shippers have sustained over the last few years, shippers are at a crossroads where they are looking to other avenues of saving money. We’ve never experienced a time where shippers have been more open to multisourcing from regional carriers and others,” he said.One example is SurePost, a product that UPS operates in conjunction with the U.S. Postal Service in which UPS tenders low-weight, nonurgent parcels to the Postal Service for last-mile delivery. Under tentative agreements already reached, the size of UPS SurePost packages eligible for handoff to the Postal Service will be reduced. In addition, UPS agreed that 50% of all SurePost parcels will be redirected to UPS by the end of the next contract, up from 42% currently. Both agreements are likely to push more of those parcels on to UPS package cars.Story continuesHowever, Josh Taylor, senior director of professional services for consultancy Shipware LLC, said that insourcing a higher percentage of SurePost packages will hurt UPS’s SurePost profitability. “They are outsourcing those packages today to the USPS because it is cheaper and more efficient than having the Teamsters deliver them,” Taylor said.SurePost is often more expensive (and slower) than comparable services at postal expeditors like DHL eCommerce, OSM Worldwide and others. Any extraordinary rate increase UPS tries to pass along will drive more shippers into the arms of their competitors, potentially increasing UPS’s internal costs not just for SurePost, but for all residential deliveries,” Taylor said.“UPS has been unwilling to sacrifice margins under [CEO] Carol Tomé. She likes to make the point that price is determined by what the customer is willing to pay,” Taylor said. “We should expect UPS to return to the same playbook and attempt to raise SurePost rates to avoid any margin loss, but SurePost service is different than Air/Ground and increasing rates could easily spiral out of control.”John Haber, chief strategy officer at Transportation Insight Holding Co., said that shippers are extremely cost-sensitive in the current market environment, “and if UPS becomes drastically more expensive than other options, then they will risk losing customers. There is still a lack of full-scale competition in the U.S. small parcel market, and some shippers may not have other options — UPS may be able to raise rates for these customers without impunity. However, I don’t see this across all customers.”“What could be problematic,” Haber said, “is if other carriers follow suit with UPS and follow their lead on pricing increases. With the soft economy weighing on parcel providers and volume levels, the only way to achieve profitability goals is through either increasing revenue-per-piece yields or via cost-cutting measures.”Branden Burt, director of parcel operations for TransImpact LLC, said he expects UPS to honor contracts as they are constructed. However, “I’d suspect UPS to pull revenue levers” such as raising delivery and fuel surcharges to existing customers, Burt said. “The revenue levers are more easily passed to the end consumers.”Dean Maciuba, managing director, U.S. operations for Crossroads Parcel Consulting, listed four reasons why UPS will be constrained in its rate actions. First, demand has largely dried up due to the slowing economy. Second, rival FedEx Corp., (NYSE: FDX) already a lower-cost, largely nonunion carrier, is in the process of taking billions of dollars of costs out of its business. Thus, it can more profitably offer service at lower rates than UPS, making it harder for UPS to raise rates, Maciuba said. Third, the proliferation of smaller but lower-cost options like regional carriers.Fourth, the continued growth of forward stocking micro-fulfillment distribution solutions will negatively impact parcel carrier volume moving forward. This will impair scale and negatively impact the cost of handling packages. “Historically, UPS has profitably managed and leveraged scale better than any other parcel carrier,” Maciuba said. “UPS may have to lower rates to hold on to the scale necessary to drive margin.”“Given the demand being soft at present and likely to remain that way for rest of 2023, it will be hard to push higher rates and surcharges to cover the change in labor cost with the new contract,” said Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc., a transportation consulting firm.Instead, Jindel said he expects UPS to increase its penetration of small to midsize business accounts which generally provide a higher yield, make offers that make it attractive for small shippers to drop off packages at UPS locations and don’t require a pickup, and faster rollout of productivity-enhancing technology initiatives. Jindel also would like to see UPS build more density for residential deliveries by promoting one-day-a-week deliveries for multiple items rather than five items ordered on different days of the week to be delivered on five different days.Given UPS’s history of offsetting bottom-line contract hits, some see little trouble in the company being able to afford wage increases and remain profitable. Amit Mehrotra, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a mid-May note that “we see little risk that prospective wage inflation will “derail the profitable growth story” at UPS, and that the company’s shares should outperform strongly if and when a work stoppage is averted, which Mehrotra expected will be the case.The post UPS may find it hard to pass along higher labor costs appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The current contract expires July 31.Earlier this month, the Teamsters said 97% of unionized workers voted for a strike authorization, which the union urged to give it more leverage during negotiations with the company.The Teamsters represent more than half of the company’s workforce in the largest private-sector contract in North America. If a strike occurs, it would be the first since a 15-day walkout by 185,000 workers crippled the company a quarter century ago.UPS has pushed back on those claims by boasting that is provides workers with industry-leading pay and benefits.Unionized UPS workers are still upset about the current contract, which they feel was forced on them by prior union leadership in 2018 based on a technicality. The contract created two hierarchies of workers with different pay scales, hours and benefits. The union wants it eliminated.Story continuesTwo weeks ago, the union and the company announced they reached a tentative agreement to equip more trucks with air conditioning equipment, a major sticking point. UPS said it would add air conditioning to U.S. small delivery vehicles purchased after January 1, 2024.UPS delivers around 25 million packages a day, representing about a quarter of all U.S. parcel volume, according to the global shipping and logistics firm Pitney Bowes. That’s about 10 million parcels more than it delivered each day in the years leading up to the pandemic.UPS profits have soared since the pandemic began in 2020 as millions of Americans grew to rely on delivery to their doorstops.Annual profits at UPS in the past two years are close to three times what they were pre-pandemic. The Atlanta company returned about $8.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks in 2022, and forecasts another $8.4 billion for shareholders this year.——AP Business Reporter Haleluya Hadero contributed to this report from New York.]"

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) share price is up 81% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 34% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 24% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for American Express To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, American Express achieved compound earnings per share growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 22% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of American Express' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for American Express the TSR over the last 3 years was 87%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that American Express shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 24% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.American Express is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

(AP) — Billionaire Warren Buffett's company keeps buying shares of Occidental Petroleum, and Berkshire Hathaway now controls more than 25% of the oil producer.A new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Berkshire bought another 2.1 million Occidental shares this week worth about $123 million.The latest purchases give Berkshire more than 224 million shares worth nearly $13 billion that have all been purchased over the past year and a half.And Buffett may not be done buying because the price of Occidental stock is still right around where he bought shares at this week even after a modest 43-cent bump Thursday morning to trade at $57.89. Buffett has been consistently buying the stock when it dips below $60.Crude prices are down 13% this year and shares of Occidental are down 8%.Often, other investors rush into a stock after Berkshire discloses a purchase because of Buffett's remarkably successful track record over the decades. But their enthusiasm may be tempered in this case because Buffett told shareholders at his annual meeting that he has no plans to buy all of Occidental.But last year, Buffett did get permission from federal regulators to buy up to 50% of the Houston-based oil producer, and Berkshire holds warrants to buy another 83.9 million shares for $59.62 apiece, so more purchases seem likely.In addition, Berkshire also holds 91,964 preferred shares of Occidental worth more than $10 billion that it picked up in 2019 when it helped finance Occidental’s acquisition of Anadarko. Berkshire used to hold more of those preferred shares, but Occidental has started redeeming them this year at $110,000 apiece to eliminate the hefty dividend the oil producer has to pay on them.Berkshire owns a portfolio worth several hundred billion dollars that includes major stakes in Apple, Bank of America and Coca-Cola stock. But the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns dozens of companies outright including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several large utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail firms.]"

Arabica is historically priced higher than robusta due to its higher quality.The bank said in a note that the spread between arabica and robusta have been falling steadily as robusta prices rose to an all-time high this month on tight supplies and the prospect that the El Nino weather pattern would hurt production in Asia.""Currently at $0.35/lb, and very close to a significant historical support of around $0.22-$0.25/lb, this could represent a good entry point opportunity,"" said the bank, noting that the spread had hit a record high of $1.55 in February, 2022.Citi said prices for arabica and robusta had a 75% correlation over the last 10 years, which flipped to -36% in the past month.It added that a potential risk for that trade is a further liquidation of arabica futures by funds.Arabica fell to a five-month low on Thursday as the market continued to be pressured by good progress in the Brazilian harvest.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Richard Chang)]"

According to Brewer, retailers say it has ""gotten exponentially worse"" since the COVID-19 pandemic, when stores were short of staff to monitor store shelves.Story continuesOrganized gangs have also taken advantage of store policies that bar employees from engaging during a robbery or theft.While most retailers do not list that guidance on their websites for fear of people taking advantage of the policy, executives including Lululemon's CEO have come under fire for letting go of employees who have tried to stop shoplifters.WHO FOOTS THE BILL FOR IT?When retailers face high costs, their profit margins take a hit and they typically look to raise prices for shoppers.That means that, in the end, shoppers may bear the cost of retailers' losses to organized retail crime, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in December.Target, Dollar Tree, Foot Locker and Ulta Beauty have all disclosed recently that organized retail crime is a problem at their stores.RILA's tally counts the value of merchandise lost to all retail crime, which includes employee theft, regular shoplifting and fraud.But it doesn't include the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by states such as Illinois, Colorado, Connecticut, Washington and California, where law enforcement has set up special task forces to fight organized retail crime.California alone has invested more than $241.4 million over the past year bolstering law enforcement efforts to investigate and prevent organized retail theft.Operation Overload, a year-long investigation by the California Highway Patrol, led to the recovery of $50 million in stolen goods - TVs, laptops, microwaves, cars, makeup and clothing, from brands including Samsung, HiSense and Hurley.The stolen goods were kept in storage units and houses. As of May, the cops were still investigating who the owners of the stolen goods were.CVS and Home Depot were involved in the investigation, according to RILA, indicating that they were two of the chains from which criminals stole the goods.WHAT ARE RETAILERS DOING ABOUT IT?In addition to working with law enforcement agencies, retailers are putting up plexiglass cases and steel cables to lock down merchandise, and adding security and large alarm systems to their stores.Ulta said in May that perfumes were one of its most targeted products for theft. It will have locked display cases in 70% of its stores by the end of the year.Dollar Tree is considering taking frequently targeted items, such as men's underwear, out of stores given the increase in theft across all the retailer's locations.It is also putting commonly stolen items like cigarettes and deodorant behind cash registers in some stores.Home Depot is using ""human and technology resources"" to make theft in stores more difficult, Evelyn Forbes, senior manager of public affairs, told Reuters.Some of its most stolen items are wire and wiring devices, power tools, and home automation products, she said.

323,7f6cb1bc-18dd-3ad7-a9c8-09ac3894589c,GE,2023-06-30,General Electric Company (GE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-company-ge-attracting-130011278.html,1688043611,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric (GE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this industrial conglomerate have returned +5.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Diversified Operations industry, to which GE belongs, has gained 3.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, GE is expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share, indicating a change of -41% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -22.5%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.96 indicates a change of +95.4% from what GE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for GE.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of GE, the consensus sales estimate of $14.98 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -19.6%. The $62.03 billion and $67.74 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19% and +9.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGE reported revenues of $14.49 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.69%. The EPS surprise was +107.69%.Over the last four quarters, GE surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.GE is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GE. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In its simplest form, free cash flow is the total cash a company keeps after operating costs and capital expenditures.Free cash flow strength allows for more growth opportunities, a higher potential for share buybacks, stable dividend payouts, and the ability to wipe out any debt easily.For those interested in cash-generating machines, three companies – Apple AAPL, UnitedHealth UNH, and Broadcom AVGO – all fit the criteria.Let’s take a closer look at each.AppleApple is often labeled the ‘King’ of free cash flow for understandable reasons; the company generated a mighty $25.6 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest quarter. And over the last trailing twelve-month, the tech titan has generated nearly $100 billion of free cash flow.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchApple shares aren’t cheap, with the current 31.6X forward earnings multiple sitting well above the 24.7X five-year median. Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company’s favorable standing, with AAPL shares up more than 40% year-to-date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe tech titan bounced back in its latest release and delivered better-than-expected results; Apple penciled in a solid 5.5% EPS beat and reported revenue nearly 2% above expectations. The market cheered on the results, with shares finding plenty of buyers post-earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnitedHealthUnitedHealth provides a wide range of healthcare products and services, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). The health titan reported $15.6 billion in free cash flow in its latest quarter, jumping a sizable 220% from the year-ago period.The company has also shown a commendable commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, boasting a 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. UNH shares yield 1.6% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 29% of its earnings.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company is forecasted to continue its steady growth, with estimates calling for 12% earnings growth in its current fiscal year and a further 22% in FY24. Revenue growth is apparent also, expected to climb 12.6% in FY23 and 6.4% in FY24.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBroadcomBroadcom is a premier designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices. The company has enjoyed favorable earnings estimate revisions across the board as of late, indicating optimism among analysts.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSimilar to UNH, Broadcom has consistently grown its dividend payout, boasting an impressive 20% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares currently yield 2.1% annually, more than double the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to top it off, the company has been a big-time earnings performer, exceeding earnings and revenue expectations in each of its last ten quarters. Just in its latest release, AVGO penciled in a 2% EPS beat and reported revenue modestly above expectations.Bottom LineWhen scouting potential portfolio additions, free cash flow is undoubtedly a metric worth serious attention.A company displaying free cash flow strength has freedom for growth opportunities, can consistently shell out dividends, and wipe out debt easily.And all three companies above – Apple AAPL, UnitedHealth UNH, and Broadcom AVGO – generate substantial cash.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

327,7bfc9a2c-ab2c-3fe2-aa3d-3b06369dd410,UNH,2023-06-30,20 American Cities with the Lowest Uninsured Rates,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-american-cities-lowest-uninsured-130541670.html,1688043941,STORY,"['UNH', 'ELV']","[In this article, we discuss the 20 American cities with the lowest uninsured rates. To skip the details about the causes of uninsured rates and state-wise costs of healthcare in the US, go directly to 5 American Cities With the Lowest Uninsured Rates.In a previous article, we covered the top 20 American cities that have the highest rates of uninsured individuals. In this article, our focus shifts to discussing the cities with the lowest rates of uninsured residents. Before diving into that, let's briefly review the key points we discussed earlier. We mentioned that in 2020, 8.3% of the American civilian noninstitutionalized population was uninsured in 2021. Among the children under 19 years of age, 5.0% of the population was uninsured while among the adults between the ages of 19 and 64, 11.6% of the civilian noninstitutionalized population was uninsured. We also discussed that the top reasons for uninsured rates were unaffordability and ineligibility. Texas was the state with the highest number of uninsured people at 20.5% while Massachusetts was the state with the lowest population of uninsured people at 2.9%.State-wise Health CostsAccording to a Forbes report, South Dakota is the state with the most expensive healthcare costs, followed by Louisiana. The average healthcare cost per person in South Dakota is around $11,736 and $9,796 in Louisiana. Both of these states also pay some of the highest health insurance premiums in the country. Contrary to that, the lowest per-person healthcare spending was seen in New Mexico, while Washington and Michigan were the states with the lowest overall healthcare costs. Both of the latter states also had some of the lowest 5-year increases in healthcare spending per person with Michigan at 13.67% and Washington having a 5-year increase of 14.43%.Healthcare for Veterans and In-service PopulationAs our articles discuss the percentage of the uninsured civilian noninstitutionalized population, let us discuss the health care coverage in the military population as well.The Department of Defense, along with the TRICARE program and the Department of Veterans Affairs, ensures that healthcare coverage is provided to the active-duty military personnel, their dependents, and veterans. According to a report by the Federation of American Scientists, 2.7% of the US population was covered by TRICARE, and 2.2% of the population had VA Care, both of which accounted for $150 billion in expenditures.Story continuesAffordable Care ActThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed in 2010 by former President, Barack Obama. The ACA’s main purpose was to make healthcare more affordable to a wider population in the United States. The act provides premium tax credits for consumers whose incomes fall between 100% to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level. For 2023, the Federal Poverty Level numbers lie at $14,580 per individual, $19,720 for a family of two and further adding $5,140 for each extra family member. The ACA also barred insurers from denying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions and ending coverage if the individual policyholder falls ill.Apart from the ACA, the Inflation Reduction Act signed in August 2022 also put forth provisions that will benefit the insured population. According to the act, the out-of-pocket prescription drug costs are capped at $2,000 annually for Medicare beneficiaries.Health Care Spending in the USDue to the high healthcare costs in the United States, it is estimated that the country’s annual healthcare spending is around $3 trillion per annum. Some of the reasons include the high costs of prescription drugs, the aging population, unhealthy lifestyles, and high expenditure on chronic diseases. Prescription drugs alone are expected to rise in price by 136% between 2010 and 2025. The average annual income of physicians and surgeons is another factor that drives up healthcare costs in the US. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the annual median pay for physicians and surgeons in the US was $208,000 or $100 per hour. We also discussed some other factors for high healthcare costs in our article about the American cities with the highest uninsured rates.The rising healthcare costs benefit some health insurance stocks such as UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), and Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) over the long term. The stock prices of health insurance companies were under pressure earlier this year, however, if you take a look at the 5-10 year price charts of United Health (UNH) and Elevance Health (ELV) you will see that these stocks outperformed the market by a large margin. We believe this trend is likely to continue as there aren't any structural changes happening in the US health care markets.20 American Cities With the Lowest Uninsured RatesRavital/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we collected the latest data (2021) from the US Census Bureau and listed the cities in descending order of their uninsured rate percentage of each city’s civilian noninstitutionalized population (the population that is 16 and over and is not serving in the armed forces or is not incarcerated by any prison system). To stay true to the data, we only chose cities for our list and did not use the data for metropolitan areas or census-designated places. Note that, the data provided does not include the population that lost their health insurance coverage during the calendar year, which means that if an individual was insured at any point in the year, that individual was considered a part of the insured population.20.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.6bUS$15.4bUS$16.8bUS$17.7bUS$18.5bUS$19.1bUS$19.7bUS$20.2bUS$20.7bUS$21.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.41%Est @ 3.02%Est @ 2.75%Est @ 2.56%Est @ 2.42% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$12.8kUS$13.5kUS$13.8kUS$13.6kUS$13.2kUS$12.8kUS$12.4kUS$11.9kUS$11.4kUS$10.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$126bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$456bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$456b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$235bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$361b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$149, the company appears about fair value at a 2.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Procter &amp; Gamble as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Procter &amp; GambleStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.45%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.8%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.99%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest consumer products maker had gained 5.26% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 1.27% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.25% in that time.Procter &amp; Gamble will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.32, up 9.09% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $19.95 billion, up 2.25% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.86 per share and revenue of $81.41 billion, which would represent changes of +0.86% and +1.52%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Procter &amp; Gamble should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Procter &amp; Gamble is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Procter &amp; Gamble has a Forward P/E ratio of 25.6 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.18, so we one might conclude that Procter &amp; Gamble is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, PG's PEG ratio is currently 4.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Soap and Cleaning Materials industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 3.95 as of yesterday's close.The Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 26, which puts it in the top 11% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, to which P&amp;G belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of +9.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.35 indicates a change of +8.3% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate of $19.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.3%. The $81.41 billion and $85.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.5% and +4.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.37 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.01%. The EPS surprise was +3.79%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Ltd, valuing the asset at $2 billion. The sale follows its successful $500 million refinancing of 919 Third Avenue earlier this year.The partnership comes at a time when the commercial real estate sector deals with period of adjustment due to the increased adoption of hybrid work models. The deal marks a reassuring vote of confidence in the resilience of New York's office market.Outside of the sale, SL Green is a reliable dividend payer, appealing to investors who prefer consistent income generation. So, how can investors earn $500 a month from its stock?Check out:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.We’ll start with the $500 per month target, which translates to an annual target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).Next, we’ll divide the $6,000 by SL's whopping 12.2% dividend yield: $6,000 / 0.122 = $43,478.26.So, an investor looking to yield $500 per month from SL Green would need $49,180.33, or 1,703 shares.For a more modest $100 per month ($1,200 annually), an investor would need $9,836.07, or 341 shares.Check out other high yield investments here.Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.Story continuesFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. If the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.Read next:Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100How To Earn $500 A Month From Starbucks Stock Amid Rumored StrikeClosing the Wealth Gap: Investment Fund Delivers Impressive Returns To Its Investors And TenantsPhoto: ShutterstockDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Principal Financial Group's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Recognition must be given to the that Principal Financial Group has grown EPS by 58% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Our analysis has highlighted that Principal Financial Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. Principal Financial Group shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 13% to 32%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Principal Financial Group's future EPS 100% free.Are Principal Financial Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$18b company like Principal Financial Group. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$68m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Should You Add Principal Financial Group To Your Watchlist?Principal Financial Group's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Principal Financial Group very closely. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Principal Financial Group.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

It may not have been easy to hold on to ETN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Eaton's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Eaton's main business drivers.Dublin, Ireland-based Eaton Corporation plc is a diversified power management company and a global technology leader in electrical components and systems. It sells products in more than 175 countries and has 92,000 employees. The company was founded in 1916.Eaton’s current reportable segments post closure of the Hydraulics segment on Aug 2, 2021 are Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, Aerospace, Vehicle and eMobility.The Electrical Americas segment includes sales contracts that are primarily for electrical and industrial components, power distribution and assemblies, residential products, single and three-phase power quality, wiring devices, circuit protection, utility power distribution, power reliability equipment, as well as services that are primarily produced and sold in North and South America. The Electrical Global segment consists of the same activities as mentioned in Electrical Americas but are primarily produced and sold outside of North and South America.Vehicle segment includes the company's erstwhile truck and automotive segments. The truck segment designs, manufactures and markets powertrain systems and other components for commercial vehicle markets. Aerospace segment is a supplier of aerospace fuel, hydraulic and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use.The eMobility segment focus on two technologies within electrical vehicles, namely Power electronics &amp; conversion and Power distribution &amp; circuit protection.Eaton's segments — Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, Aerospace, Vehicle and eMobility — contributed 41%, 28.2%, 14.6%, 13.6% and 2.6%, respectively to 2022 revenues.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Eaton a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $2,959.28, or a gain of 195.93%, as of June 29, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 172.48% and the price of gold went up 48.84% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for ETN too.Eaton’s ongoing research and development investments allowed it to develop products for providing efficient power management solutions to customers. Eaton will benefit from the improving end market conditions and contribution from its organic assets assisting it to retain a strong market position. ETN is expanding via acquisitions and rising backlogs further boost its performance. Eaton's strategy to manufacture in the zone of sale has helped it reduce costs. Its shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. Our model projects total revenues to increase in 2023-2025 period. Yet, ETN’s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, changes in tax rates, and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 10.72%, and there have been 7 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

341,2e4eee56-86b4-30df-bfe2-ed515534bcf2,AFL,2023-06-30,Has Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) Stock's Recent Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflac-incorporated-nyse-afl-stocks-102217785.html,1688120537,STORY,['AFL'],"[Most readers would already know that Aflac's (NYSE:AFL) stock increased by 7.1% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Aflac's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Aflac How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aflac is:22% = US$4.3b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.22.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Aflac's Earnings Growth And 22% ROEAt first glance, Aflac seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 9.9%. However, for some reason, the higher returns aren't reflected in Aflac's meagre five year net income growth average of 4.0%. This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesWe then compared Aflac's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 14% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is AFL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Aflac Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?A low three-year median payout ratio of 21% (implying that the company retains the remaining 79% of its income) suggests that Aflac is retaining most of its profits. This should be reflected in its earnings growth number, but that's not the case. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.In addition, Aflac has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 29% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 14% over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Aflac has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

The company’s systematic investments to strengthen operations and strategic acquisitions continue to bolster its position in the industry.The company delivered an average surprise of 5.04% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWK’s 2023 earnings per share has moved up 5.8% year-over-year to $4.77.TailwindsAmerican Water has plans to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion in the next decade. The company is on track to invest nearly $2.9 billion in 2023, with a major portion to be utilized for infrastructure improvements in Regulated Businesses.AWK’s capital investment is backed up by rate revisions by the commission per application from the company. American Water has been benefiting from rate increases. New rates, effective Jan 1, 2023, will add $279 million to annual revenues. The pending rate case, if approved without any change, will further increase the top line by $144 million. The ongoing expansion of the rate base will have a positive impact on its earnings over the long term.Consolidation is the need of the hour in the fragmented U.S. water utility space and American Water continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions. From the start of 2023 until Mar 31, 2023, the company expanded its customer base by 1,400 through organic means and acquisitions.

Eylea, a biologic therapy for various eye disorders like wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), generated approximately $6.3 billion in net U.S. sales for the drugmaker in 2022.Continue reading]"

These flaws caused the FDA to reject a drug application from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN, marking another setback for manufacturing partners in the pharmaceutical industry.Catalent’s shares nosedived 10.4% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 3.6%. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 15% in the same time frame.The Latest DenialEarlier this week, the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for Regeneron’s Biologics License Application (BLA), seeking approval for a more potent formulation of its top-selling eye medication, Eylea. The CRL did not identify any issue with the aflibercept (Eylea) 8 mg clinical efficacy or safety, trial design, labeling or drug substance manufacturing. No additional clinical data or trial has been requested.The reason for the denial was ""solely due to an ongoing review of inspection findings at a third-party filler,"" the drugmaker said on Tuesday. Per a Bloomberg article, the filler in question is Catalent's Bloomington site, where the FDA made three observations during a pre-approval inspection.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron submitted the BLA seeking approval for Eylea 8 mg for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy.Previous Setbacks &amp; Their ImpactThe Regeneron incident is the latest in a series of highly publicized setbacks for CTLT. Previous deficiencies uncovered during an FDA inspection at the same Bloomington facility led to supply constraints for Moderna Inc.'s COVID booster shot last autumn.Catalent was also reportedly linked to production issues with Novo Nordisk A/S' weight-loss drug, Wegovy, which experienced shortages for approximately one year.Per a Morgan Stanley analyst, the series of high-profile therapy affected by inspection findings at a Catalent site is likely to have an impact on the company's ability to clinch future supply deals.Story continuesAny delay in the approval of the stronger formulation of Eylea could affect Regeneron. The drug may start to face competition from less expensive, near-identical versions of the same next year. Analysts are counting on the higher dose to help Regeneron stay ahead of the competition.Danaher Corp. was reportedly eyeing CTLT before shelving its buyout pursuit earlier this year, which may be linked to such adverse inspection findings impacting drug launches.What Lies Ahead?Catalent has responded by stating that it takes all regulatory observations seriously and has already provided proposed corrective and preventative actions to address the observations. The company added that it will continue to support FDA's ongoing review of its response.Earlier this year, CTLT reported that its gene therapy production site near Baltimore had some operational issues that caused delays. The company also said that it was introducing some improvements to its facilities in Bloomington and Brussels after regulators inspected them. These upgrades might affect their efficiency for the time being.The persistence of problems at Catalent’s production facilities is likely to hamper the company’s ability to deliver on time as well as secure new deals. A faster resolution of deficiencies at its facilities is necessary for ensuring growth.Catalent, Inc. PriceCatalent, Inc. PriceCatalent, Inc. price | Catalent, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Before Its Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-investors-look-cisco-systems-101438002.html,1688120078,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Readers hoping to buy Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Cisco Systems' shares before the 5th of July to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of July.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.39 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.56 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Cisco Systems has a trailing yield of approximately 3.0% on its current stock price of $51.21. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Cisco Systems's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Cisco Systems paid out 55% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 37% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that Cisco Systems's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Cisco Systems, with earnings per share up 8.0% on average over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Cisco Systems has delivered 11% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineIs Cisco Systems worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share growth has been modest and Cisco Systems paid out over half of its profits and less than half of its free cash flow, although both payout ratios are within normal limits. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Cisco Systems from a dividend perspective.Wondering what the future holds for Cisco Systems?
