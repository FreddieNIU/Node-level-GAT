The company is facing sluggishness in the Analog segment remains a concern. Further, weakening momentum across personal electronics and industrial end-markets is a negative. Additionally, pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds.However, Texas Instruments fourth quarter results were driven by solid momentum across its Embedded Processing segment. Growing demand for embedded technologies across the automotive and industrial markets contributed well.Additionally, continued rebound in the automotive market was a tailwind. We note that the company’s growing investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Enbridge have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry over the past year (-4.9% vs. +1.7%). The company has significant debt exposure since there has been a weakness in its operations. Also, it has mostly been yielding lower dividends than the industry over the past year.  As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.However, Enbridge has the longest and most sophisticated oil and liquids pipeline system in the world, which spreads across 17,809 miles. Hence, a significant portion of the midstream operator’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts.Enbridge increased its annualized common share dividend to C$3.55 per share, thereby marking a dividend hike for 28 straight years. The leading midstream company expects to put more than C$13 billion growth projects into service in 2024 and beyond.

FISV's diversified product portfolio helps attract a steady flow of customers.Acquisitions help expand its product portfolio, enhance offerings, boost its market share and customer base.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Nucor Corp. NUE, Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD, United Rentals Inc. URI and Ameriprise Financial Inc. AMP.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Momentum Stock for February After a Strong JanuaryWall Street ended the first month of 2023 with a solid rally after a highly disappointing 2022. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — appreciated 2.8%, 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 closed their third positive month in four. The S&amp;P 500 posted the best January since 2019. The Nasdaq Composite ended the best month since July and the best January since 2001.Favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic data and a resilient labor market raised market participants’ hope for a soft landing of the U.S. economy. At this stage, it should be profitable to invest in momentum stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Five such stocks are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Nucor Corp., Steel Dynamics Inc.,United Rentals Inc. and Ameriprise Financial Inc.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Story continuesPeak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five momentum stocks. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions over the last seven days, which indicates that the market is expecting these companies to do solid business in 2023. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Momentum Score of A.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer-Daniels-Midland Steady growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth going forward. ADM has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.7% over the last seven days.Nucor is committed to expanding its production capabilities and growing its business through strategic acquisitions. NUE has already commissioned some of its growth projects. These should drive growth and strengthen Nucor’s position as a low-cost producer. NUE is also seeing strong momentum in the non-residential construction market and strong demand in the heavy equipment market.Nucor remains focused on achieving greater penetration of the automotive market because of the segment’s long-term growth opportunities. Higher steel prices due to tight supply and higher end-market demand should also drive NUE’s margins. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.Steel Dynamics is expected to gain from acquisitions as well as strong liquidity and efforts to expand capacity. The acquisitions of Heartland and United Steel Supply have boosted Steel Dynamics' shipping capabilities. Moreover, the buyout of Zimmer should support the raw material procurement strategy at its new Texas flat-roll steel mill.STLD is also expected to gain from its investments to beef up capacity and upgrade facilities. Steel Dynamics is executing several projects that should add to capacity and boost profitability. The electric-arc-furnace flat roll steel mill should strengthen its steelmaking capacity and value-added product capability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.8% over the last seven days.United Rentals is benefiting from the U.S. administration’s increased focus on infrastructural improvement. URI has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals. Better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in non-residential construction and industrial verticals, higher total and rental revenues and stronger pricing aided URI’s fiscal 2022 results.United Rentals’  upbeat guidance exhibits broad-based growth across its verticals, with persistent growth opportunities for datacenters, distribution centers and renewables as well as the automotive and ship plants projects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.8% over the last seven days.Ameriprise Financial is a leading asset management company.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend investing, and go directly to read 5 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right Now. On February 1, 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, which marked its eighth increase since March 2022. The continuous interest rate hikes have made investors anxious about the stock market’s future. According to Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in January, investors broadly gave a pessimistic view of the market. However, over half of the respondents showed an inclination toward cheaper value stocks, considering their outperformance over growth equities in 2022. In addition to this, companies that have proven track records of dividend growth also made it to investors’ choice.Value stocks showed their greatest performance last year against growth equities since 2000, as reported by Bloomberg. Analysts expect the trend of value investing to continue this year as higher interest rates put margin pressures on the technology sector. Moreover, last year’s selloff was the worst for tech stocks since 2008, so investors are moving toward defensive quality stocks to stay afloat during this period. In this regard, dividend stocks regained their appeal, with dividend payments reaching their record high in 2022. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, compared with $511.2 billion in 2021. The report also mentioned that 373 companies in the S&amp;P 500 raised their dividend through December 15, up from 353 in 2021. These results show that companies have the sufficient cash flow to fulfill their shareholder obligation smoothly.AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) are some of the popular dividend companies that are gaining popularity among investors. These companies not only have raised their dividends for years but also have strong cash generation that promises further growth in the future. Given this, we will discuss the cheapest dividend aristocrats in this article.Story continues15 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right NowPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below belong to the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats, the companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more.

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits.

The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — appreciated 2.8%, 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 closed their third positive month in four. The S&amp;P 500 posted the best January since 2019. The Nasdaq Composite ended the best month since July and the best January since 2001.Favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic data and a resilient labor market raised market participants’ hope for a soft landing of the U.S. economy. At this stage, it should be profitable to invest in momentum stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Five such stocks are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Nucor Corp. NUE, Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD, United Rentals Inc. URI and Ameriprise Financial Inc. AMP.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.Story continuesOn Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five momentum stocks. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions over the last seven days, which indicates that the market is expecting these companies to do solid business in 2023. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Momentum Score of A.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher-Daniels-Midland.

(NASDAQ:QRVO) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 1, 2023Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Qorvo, Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Douglas DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.Douglas DeLieto: Thanks very much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain noncash expenses or any -- or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our Investor Relations website at ir.qorvo.com under Financial Releases. Joining us today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; and Grant Brown, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing and other members of Qorvo's management team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.Story continuesBob Bruggeworth: Thanks, Doug, and welcome, everyone, to our call. Qorvo delivered fiscal third quarter revenue and EPS above the midpoint of our outlook provided during our November 2nd earnings call. In High-Performance Analog, quarterly revenue reflected year-over-year growth in defense, broadband and power. Our power business posted a strong quarter with robust design activity for our silicon carbide power devices. Offsetting this were power management markets with consumer exposure in infrastructure where customers are working down elevated inventory levels. In our Connectivity &amp; Sensors Group, the quarter reflected lower end market demand and channel inventory consumption for Wi-Fi products partially offset by strength in automotive.Design activity was strong across customers and products, including ultra-wideband, matter and sensors. Use cases continue to proliferate their benefit from precision location, indoor navigation, seamless connectivity and enhanced human machine interfaces. Lastly, in Advanced Cellular, Qorvo participated broadly across customers' portfolios. The macro environment weighed on overall smartphone volumes across customers, and revenue reflected channel inventory consumption within the Android ecosystem. Design activity continued to be strong across customers and product categories and supports year-over-year content gains at our largest customers. Now, let's turn to some quarterly highlights. In High-Performance Analog, Qorvo began sampling a radar power solution that combines a high-voltage power conversion PMIC and silicon carbide power switches to control a GaN RF power amplifier.The solution reduces the size by up to 30% in D&amp;A radar systems while expanding Qorvo's content opportunity. We also expanded our SHIP state-of-the-art RF packaging contract with the U.S. government to develop multichip modules that combine digital optical devices with Qorvo's mixed-signal RF. In aerospace, we delivered a multichip solution that includes Qorvo's high-frequency BAW filter as well as a GaN PA for low orbit satellites and other applications. The solution supports cellular satellite links, and we have secured new designs. The opportunity for Qorvo is notable given the trend in defense and aerospace applications of one to many. That means rather than one jet, there will also be many drones; rather than one geo-satellite, there will also be many LEO satellites.At the same time, new capabilities are being added to existing platforms that require increased semiconductor content and higher density and more advanced packaging, all areas where Qorvo is strong and is investing to advance the technology. In cellular infrastructure, we commenced preproduction shipments of our first integrated PA modules, or PAMs, to a Tier 1 European infrastructure OEM for 5G massive-MIMO base stations. We also began sampling our next-generation PAM, which delivers market-leading efficiency for 5G massive-MIMO installations to the leading European infrastructure OEMs. For broadband infrastructure applications, we sampled a CATV power doubler amplifier that maintains linearity and extends bandwidth to enable higher throughput DOCSIS 4.0 capabilities with industry-leading power efficiency.Deployments of DOCSIS 4.0 are scheduled to begin this year and Qorvo is very well positioned as the industry leader. In CSG, we expanded our Wi-Fi content at a Korean-based smartphone OEM to include Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 designs and we ramped Wi-Fi 7 FEMs for access points and routers for our smart home ecosystem customer. We also commenced sampling 5 gigahertz and 6 gigahertz filters. These filters leverage Qorvo's next-generation BAW process and enable worldwide Wi-Fi 7 frequency coverage. There is increase in customer interest related to multi-link operation, which is a key attribute of Wi-Fi 7 and enables higher throughput and lower latency. Lastly, we began volume shipments of MEMS-based sensors, enabling an enhanced HMI experience and true wireless stereo earbuds.Qorvo sensors were selected to replace legacy capacitive touch sensor technology. Design activity for sensors continues to be strong across markets, including automotive. We are working with leading automotive Tier 1s and have secured automotive smart interior design wins in more than 25 vehicles. In Advanced Cellular, we secured multiple design wins across Android OEMs in support of 2023 devices. During the quarter, we commenced the production ramp of multiple components for the leading Korea-based smartphone OEM's flagship platform. We have increased our content significantly year-over-year. We are broadly serving this customer across our portfolio and continue to support the migration of their mass market phones to integrated 5G solutions.At a U.S.-based Android OEM, we were selected to supply multiple solutions, including ultra-wideband, antenna tuning and BAW-based antennaplexing in support of their 2023 smartphone launches. Lastly, Qorvo was recognized by multiple customers. We were presented with Honor's 2022 Golden Supplier Award, and we received quality awards from Vivo for discrete switches and amplifiers and highly integrated solutions. Before handing the call off to Grant, I want to make a few high-level comments to frame our outlook, both in the near term and further out. At our largest two customers, we are very confident in our ability to grow year-over-year content, and that includes this year. In 2023, we expect growth in BAW-based content as well as other content growth.Equally important, we enjoy a range of opportunities across all of our customers in the future years. Qorvo is supporting the highest volume flagship phones while supplying integrated 5G solutions as mass market portfolios migrate to 5G. Fewer than half of the Android devices were 5G in 2022 and the migration of 5G is expected to extend over many years. We are unique in Advanced Cellular in the breadth of our customer exposure and in the depth of our product and technology offerings. Our long-term view of ACG continues to be mid- to high-single-digit growth driven by multiyear content gains. In particular, we see expanding market for our BAW technology. Productivity gains in our Richardson, Texas fab have enabled a doubling of our BAW output.We intend to put that to good use as we continue to capture designs and grow our BAW content in flagship phones. We expect the long-term growth rate of HPA and Connectivity and Sensors to outpace Advanced Cellular. Our view for HPA is double-digit growth. And in CSG, we expect growth in the strong double digits. Key growth areas supported by recent wins with silicon carbide devices in EVs and solar inverters, MEMS sensors and notebook track pads and automotive smart interiors and ultra wideband in automotive and Android devices. These and other investment businesses are securing new designs that extend our opportunity in large growth markets. In the near term, the team is performing exceptionally well while navigating extraordinary events. Factory loadings have been reduced, and we are bringing down channel inventories.We are also actively managing the expense line while sharpening our focus in support of targeted growth. We are working to accelerate revenue related to our Omnia BAW-based biosensors by exploring options for the associated Omnia test hardware, meaning the Omnia desktop test unit and cartridges that contain our BAW biosensors. The technology has been proven commercially, and we are engaged with a diverse set of customers. Qorvo remains at the forefront of connectivity, sustainability and electrification. We enjoy exceptional customer relationships, and we are a key enabler of future architectures. These architectures continue to favor higher levels of performance, integration and functional density to deliver the successive improvements in each market's next-generation products.Our customers value Qorvo's best-in-class products and technologies, and we are securing broad-based design wins in high-growth markets. As volumes recover, we are positioned to deliver long-term growth and robust free cash flow. And with that, I'll hand the call off to Grant.Grant Brown: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, our references today will be to our three operating segments: High-Performance Analog, or HPA; Connectivity &amp; Sensors Group, or CSG; and Advanced Cellular Group, or ACG. In our upcoming 10-Q, we will provide historical financial information that reflects these operating segments. Additional historical information will be made available in our fiscal 2023 10-K to be filed this May. I'll now turn to our latest quarterly results. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $743 million, $18 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We enjoyed relatively strong performance in automotive, broadband, defense and silicon carbide power devices. However, elevated channel inventories and weak end market demand pressured revenue and order activity across all three operating segments.Looking at each operating segment individually. HPA revenue of $155 million in the quarter compares to revenue of $182 million in the same quarter last year. In HPA, growth in areas such as defense and silicon carbide power devices was offset by inventory consumption in the 5G base station market and softness in consumer-facing markets like SSDs and battery-powered tools. CSG revenue of $97 million in the quarter compares to revenue of $158 million in the same quarter last year. This reflects weakness in end market demand for Wi-Fi products and channel inventory consumption. Finally, ACG revenue of $491 million compares to revenue of $775 million in the same quarter last year. This reflects lower smartphone unit volumes and channel inventory digestion within the Android ecosystem.On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin in the quarter was 40.9%. Gross margin fell sequentially due to lower factory utilization and higher inventory-related charges including a quality issue at a supplier. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $206 million, $90 million lower than our guidance and down $8 million versus last year due to OpEx discipline, the timing of product development spend and lower employee-related expenses including incentive-based compensation. In total, non-GAAP operating income in the quarter was $99 million or 13% of sales. Breaking out operating margin by each segment. ACG was 20%, HPA was 19% and CSG was negative 32%. Non-GAAP net income was $77 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.75, which was at the high end of our guidance range.SoftwareFree cash flow was $203 million. Capital expenditures were $34 million, and we repurchased approximately $200 million worth of shares during the quarter. The rate and pace of our repurchases is based on our long-term outlook, low leverage, alternative uses of cash and other factors. Turning to the balance sheet. As of quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of debt outstanding with no near-term maturities and $919 million of cash and equivalents. Our net inventory balance ending the quarter was up slightly at $857 million. Now turning to our current quarter outlook. We expect quarterly revenue between $600 million and $640 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 41% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.15.Our current view reflects ongoing demand weakness across end markets as well as our expectations for further consumption of channel inventory. We continue to expect sales to Android smartphone customers will increase sequentially in the March quarter. For historical reference, the March quarter revenue in fiscal 22 for each of ACG, HPA and CSG was $777 million, $211 million and $179 million, respectively. At the volume levels assumed in our guidance, we expect Qorvo's inventory position will decline in March, but remain elevated. In terms of channel inventory, the picture has begun to improve. For example, total channel inventory for our components in the Android ecosystem was reduced by over 20% in the December quarter. We expect continued improvement this quarter and anticipate the channel to normalize later this calendar year.We are actively working with customers to consume channel inventories. And in doing so, we expect production levels to remain compressed. This will lead to continuing underutilization charges related to inventories which will weigh on gross margin during fiscal Q4 and carry into next fiscal year. We project non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter will be up approximately $20 million sequentially due to the timing of product development spend, seasonal payroll effects and other employee-related expenses. Below the operating income line, non-operating expense will be approximately $15 million, reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses, along with other items.Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal Q4 is expected to be consistent with fiscal Q3. The rate remains elevated due to the absolute level and geographic mix of pretax profit including FX-related gains within high tax jurisdictions as well as the impact of the U.S. tax law change related to R&amp;D capitalization among other factors. With regards to operations, I want to highlight the outstanding progress our teams have made in terms of productivity gains. We continue to make improvements in product development, filter design, process engineering, factory planning, manufacturing efficiency and many other areas. Today, these gains have significantly increased our effective BAW capacity. And as Bob indicated, the progress continues. And looking forward, we can double our BAW capacity in the Richardson facility versus our current maximum theoretical thresholds today.Increasing a throughput of an existing asset not only reduces cost, but can reduce complexity within the factory network as production is consolidated. The BAW productivity gains in our Richardson facility allow us to achieve our long-term growth goals across all of our customers, including the most demanding BAW-based placements. As a result, we have decided to sell our Farmers Branch facility. We're in the early stages of marketing the site and initial interest has been encouraging. For reference, the site has been incurring approximately $12 million of non-GAAP COGS per year. We are also evaluating strategic alternatives for our biotechnology business to accelerate and maximize its potential value. The Omnia platform, which is based on our BAW sensor technology, has demonstrated significant promise as a diagnostic testing solution.The biotechnology unit currently resides in our CSG segment. While the revenue impact from a transaction would be negligible, it would reduce total expenses by approximately $32 million per year. At this stage, it's too early to comment on the eventual outcome, timing or potential valuation. These actions will sharpen our focus and resources on the many growth drivers across our three operating segments. Our long-term outlook is positive, and we're well-positioned to weather current macroeconomic challenges. Product performance requirements continue to increase in our end markets, sustainability initiatives underscore the increasing global reliance on power efficiency, and connectivity and electrification trends are accelerating worldwide. We have diversified our opportunities across markets, customers and product categories while maintaining our commitment to technology leadership, portfolio management, productivity gains and reduced capital intensity.This has supported strong financial performance during a challenging environment and has positioned us for long-term increasingly diversified growth. At this time, please open the line for questions.

QRVO reported healthy third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the bottom and the top line surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the Greensboro, NC-based company reported year-over-year lower revenues due to weak end-market demand, elevated inventories in the post-pandemic market, underutilization of manufacturing facilities and global uncertainty.Net IncomeGAAP net loss in the reported quarter was $15.9 million or loss of 16 cents against a net income of $216.3 million or $1.95 per share in the prior-year quarter. The sharp bottom-line contraction was attributable to a significant decline in net sales.Non-GAAP earnings in the reported quarter were $76.5 million or 75 cents per share, down from $330.4 million or $2.98 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents despite the year-over-year decline.Qorvo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Qorvo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseQorvo, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Qorvo, Inc. Quote RevenuesRevenues fell to $743.3 million from $1,114 million in the year-ago quarter. However, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $727 million and it was well above the midpoint of management’s guidance. Despite witnessing a solid performance in broadband, automotive, defense and silicon, higher channel inventories in the post-pandemic scenario and a waning end market demand hampered company’s revenues.Qorvo’s High Power Amplifier (HPA) witnessed a year-over-year decline as revenues amounted to $155 million in the December quarter, down from $182 million in the year-ago quarter. Weakness in the consumer-facing market, like SSDs and inventory consumption in the 5G base station market, stunted growth in defense and silicon carbide power devicesLow demand for WIFI products and inventory consumption also induced a fall in net sales in the company’s Connectivity &amp; Sensors Products Group. Revenue dropped to $97 million from $158 million in the corresponding quarter previous year.The company witnessed a 36% revenue contraction from the prior-year quarter’s levels in the Advanced Cellular Products Group. Revenues declined from $775 million in the same quarter last year to $491 million this quarter. Record decline in smartphone shipment in the December quarter associated with high inventory hampered Qorvo’s top-line performance in the segment.Story continuesOther DetailsOn a GAAP basis, gross profit totaled $268.1 million compared with $548.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses increased to $259.3 million from $252.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.9% compared with 52.6% in the year-ago quarter. Lower factory utilization and higher inventory-related challenges are the primary factors for this reduction. Due to OpEx discipline, the timing of product development expenditure and fewer employee-related expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $205.7 million, down from $214.2 million in the prior year.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityAs of Dec 31, 2022, QRVO had $918.8 million in cash and cash equivalents with $2,047.7 million of long-term debt compared with respective tallies of $972.6 million and  $2,047.1 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow at the end of the December quarter was $203 million, up from the prior year’s figure of 66.5 million.OutlookThe company anticipates that the smartphone market situation will improve in the March quarter as more customers will enter the market. It experienced a 20% decrease in total channel inventory for its components in the Android ecosystem during the December quarter alone. Management expects supply-demand adjustments will continue further during the next quarter and its business volume will recover later this year.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, Qorvo expects revenues to be $600-$640 million.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.Marc Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results in Q4, and as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our customers. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals. Our ability to deliver these results in a year that included global supply chain disruptions, a war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and inflationary headwinds wouldn't be possible without the incredible dedication of our team around the world.I'm very grateful for our team's great execution in effectively navigating dynamic times and enabling the success of our company and our customers. Thanks to our colleagues, our company delivers spectacular 2022, and I couldn't be more excited for 2023. I'll get into more of the details in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter. Our revenue grew 7% to $11.45 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.56 billion, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.40 per share. Turning to our results for the full year. We grew revenue by 15% to $44.92 billion in 2022. Adjusted operating income was $10.99 billion and adjusted EPS, $23.24 per share. Let me turn to our end markets.We continue to deliver excellent and differentiated performance in Q4. This was driven by a continuation of good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now give you some color for the quarter and the year. Starting with our largest end market, pharma and biotech, we continue to deliver impressive performance with growth in the low teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our pharma and biotech customers. Throughout the year, we had broad-based strength across our businesses serving this end market, highlighted by our bioproduction, pharma services, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as the research and safety market channel.In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including biosciences, electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as in the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. During the year, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. And finally, in diagnostics and health care, in Q4, revenue was approximately 40% lower than the prior year quarter and 25% lower than full year 2021. The team delivered good core business growth during the year, led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses as well as our healthcare market channel.I'll now turn to our growth strategy, which is delivering the differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar. It was another terrific year of high-impact innovation as we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, our innovations are accelerating our customers' research and unlocking deeper analytical insights.In 2022, we extended our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer to advance proteomics, metabolomics and cancer biomarker research. We also launched the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series Gas Chromatograph to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial and pharmaceutical applications. In electric microscopy, the new Thermo Scientific Glacios 2 Cryo-TEM was launched during the fourth quarter. It will help our customers accelerate structure-based drug discovery for debilitating disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington diseases as well as research for cancer and gene mutations. We also continue to build on our genetic sciences capabilities to help our customers understand, diagnose and treat disease.During the fourth quarter, our SeCore CDx HLA sequencing system was granted marketing authorization by the U.S. FDA for use as a companion diagnostic with a T cell receptor therapy for adults with ocular melanoma. This is a really nice example of how our Specialty Diagnostics business is benefiting from our capabilities in life sciences solutions. In addition, we expanded our PCR test menu to leverage our incredibly large installed base of instruments and launched the TruMark Infectious Disease Research Panels for rapid detection and research of infectious disease pathogens. To wrap up the innovation highlights, we added to our cell and gene therapy offering, most recently launching the Gibco CTS DynaCellect Magnetic Separation System. Our solutions are helping customers advance their cell and gene therapy programs.So another spectacular year of innovation, and we have an exciting pipeline of launches in 2023 and beyond. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets during the year, and I'll highlight a recent example. In the quarter, we opened a new cGMP biologics and sterile manufacturing facility in Hangzhou, China, which provides integrated clinical and commercial drug substance and drug product capabilities to help customers in China and in the Asia Pacific region deliver patient therapies more quickly. Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities.We've been executing on the significant investments we've made over the past couple of years. And throughout 2022, we brought new capacity and capabilities online for pharma services, bioproduction and clinical research services. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art bioanalytical lab in Richmond, Virginia to support our clinical research business and the increasing demand for our laboratory services to accelerate drug development. As always, our PPI Business System enabled our success during the year. It's helping us to drive meaningful share gain, maximize the return on investments, meet our customers' needs and successfully navigate a dynamic environment, including effectively addressing inflation and global supply chain challenges.PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day and enables outstanding execution. We continue to successfully execute our capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&amp;A and returning capital to our shareholders. In 2022, we successfully integrated PPD, our clinical research business. For the full year, PPD delivered core organic growth in the high teens, generating over $7 billion in revenue and contributing over $2 to our adjusted earnings per share. The combination of a great first year performance and excellent progress on our synergy realization is delivering very strong returns for our shareholders that is well ahead of the deal model. From a customer lens, the acquisition has further elevated our trusted partner status as customers are realizing significant value in partnering with our team to advance a scientific idea to an approved medicine.In 2022, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. And on the first business day of 2023, we completed the acquisition of the Binding Site, a leading specialty diagnostics company. The Binding Site is an exciting addition and highly complementary to our Specialty Diagnostic business. Together, we'll be able to advance the diagnosis and management of patients afflicted with multiple myeloma and immune disorders. Reflecting on our progress of our ESG priorities in 2022, we further advanced our environmental and philanthropic efforts while also continuing to strengthen our company culture. During the year, we continued to advance our environmental sustainability roadmap, reducing our carbon emissions and finalizing significant power purchasing agreements to accelerate our transitions towards a 100% renewable energy.Looking forward, we've also increased our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to achieve a 50% reduction in this decade. Through our Foundation for Science, we continue to advance our philanthropic efforts and supported students across the globe during the year with our STEM education programs. This included an announcement in the quarter for the Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge, the premier middle school STEM competition in the U.S. And throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was recognized for its industry leadership and inclusive culture. This includes earning 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign 2022 Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQ equality for the seventh consecutive year as well as inclusion on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies.In the quarter, we were recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the world's Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of America's best employers for veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. 2022 is a special year for Thermo Fisher, and I'm excited about 2023 and beyond. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating 2023 revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70 per share. This very strong financial outlook reflects a continuation of our track record of delivering excellent financial performance and sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders. So to summarize our key takeaways for 2022, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain.Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals while navigating a very dynamic macro environment. And we entered 2023 with strong momentum and we're incredibly well positioned beyond 2023. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?Stephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an outstanding quarter, capping off another excellent year. For the quarter and the full year, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth. This differentiated level of performance demonstrates the power of our growth strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers. In addition, in Q4, we generated $370 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $3.1 billion for the full year. Taking a step back and thinking about the top line performance for the year, I'm really proud of what the team delivered. We offset $4.2 billion less testing revenue, which was a headwind of over 10%, and still delivered slightly positive organic growth for the year.That's a great accomplishment. Then using the power of the PPI Business System, we were able to translate the top line strength to excellent adjusted EPS and cash flow results. In Q4, we delivered $0.23 more adjusted EPS than our prior guide, ending the year at $23.24 and delivered $6.94 billion of free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in the business to enable an even brighter future. So 2022 was another excellent year. Let me now provide you with some details on our performance. Beginning with the earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.40 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $23.24 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.01 and $17.63 for the full year. On the top line as I mentioned in Q4, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth and $370 million of testing revenue.Reported revenue grew 7% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increased included 3% lower organic revenue, a 14% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange. The full year core organic revenue growth was 14% and we delivered $3.1 billion in testing revenue. For the full year 2022, reported revenue increased 15%. This includes slightly positive organic growth and 18% contribution from acquisitions and a 3% headwind from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in 2022 and the prior year. In Q4, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe declined in the low teens. Asia-Pacific in the mid-single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits and rest of the world declined high single digits.For the full year, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe declined high single digits. Asia Pacific grew high single digits, including China, which also grew high single digits for the year, and the rest of the world declined high single digits. On a core organic growth basis, all regions had strong growth in 2022. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, 710 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 24.5%, which is 650 basis points lower than 2021. For both the fourth quarter and full year, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation, while also delivering strong productivity.This is more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. For 2022, full year adjusted operating margin was 40 basis points lower than assumed in the prior guidance. Two-thirds of this was due to business and currency mix and a third due to one-time costs related to the runoff of testing revenue. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.4%, 910 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 43.5%, down 810 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the changing gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. Moving on the details of the P&amp;L.Adjusted SG&amp;A in the quarter was 15.6% of revenue, an improvement of 170 basis points versus Q4 2021. For the full year, adjusted SG&amp;A was 15.8% of revenue, an improvement of 130 basis points compared to 2021. Total R&amp;D expense was $390 million in Q4. For the full year R&amp;D expense was $1.5 billion, representing 5% growth over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&amp;D as percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7% in Q4, 6.4% for the full year. Looking at results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $119 million, which is $31 million favorable to Q4 last year. Net interest expense for the full year was $454 million, a decrease of $39 million from 2021. Adjusted other income/expense was a net expense in the quarter of $10 million compared to net income of $7 million in Q4 2021.Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashThe year-over-year variance is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense of the net income of $14 million, which is $24 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 12.8%, which is a 100 basis points lower than Q4 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 13% or 160 basis points lower than 2021. We repurchase $1 billion of shares in Q4, bringing our total repurchases for 2022 to $3 billion. Average diluted shares were $393 million in Q4, approximately 4 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Full year cash flow from continuing operations was $9.15 billion.Free cash flow for the year was $6.94 billion after investing $2.2 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and $455 million for the full year. We ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in cash and $34.5 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 13.5%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment.And the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year. That does skew some of the reported segment margins. We're executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our Clinical Research business, and that resides in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. The anniversary date of the acquisition was December 8. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 27%, and organic revenue was 24% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation and testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter.For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 13% and organic revenue declined 12%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions decreased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 34.1%, down 14 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. In Q4 we had unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher testing revenue in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 29% and adjusted operating margin was 41.2%, a decrease of 880 basis points versus 2021. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q4 and organic growth was 14%. A strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses.For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 9% and organic revenue increased 14%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 25% and adjusted operating margin was 25.4%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull through and productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 310 basis points versus 2021. Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue declined 23% and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continue to see strong underlying growth in the core led by a healthcare market channel and our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses.This was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment decreased 16% and organic revenue was 13% lower than 2021. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 30% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, down 190 basis points versus Q4 2021. During the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by the impact of lower testing volume. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 20% and adjusted operating margin was 21.5%, down 110 basis points versus 2021. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 42%. Organic growth was 11% and the impact of acquisitions was 35%. During Q4, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the Pharma Services business.PPD at Clinical Research business continued to perform very well, and during the quarter it delivered over 20% core organic revenue growth and contributed $1.9 billion of revenue to the segment. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 51% and organic revenue increased 10%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 73% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, which is 260 basis points higher than Q4 2021. In the quarter, we drove favorable business mix and delivered strong productivity and volume pull through that was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 56% and adjusted operating margin was 12.8%, up 40 basis points versus 2021. Let me turn to our 2023 guidance.As Marc outlined, we're starting the year with a very strong financial outlook consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. Let me provide some details to the underlying assumptions starting with revenue. Our initial guidance for 2023 assumes 7% core organic revenue growth, $400 million in testing revenue, $250 million of revenue from acquisitions and a tailwind of $100 million from FX. This all assumes a return to more normal market growth conditions in 2023 in the range of 4% to 6%. Within our core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than 2022, a 3% impact on core organic growth. Even with this headwind, we're expecting to deliver 7% core organic revenue growth in 2023, demonstrating the strength of our initial outlook, the agility with which we're managing the business and the ongoing benefits of our growth strategy.Turning to profitability, in 2023, we're assuming an adjusted operating margin of 23.9%. This is 60 basis points lower than 2022, driven by two elements, a 40 basis points of core margin expansion and a 100 basis point headwind from the runoff of testing revenue. The year-over-year margin change is consistent with the comments I have made on the last earnings call were not described have to model a margin impact to the different elements of the year-over-year change in revenue. In 2023 with a pandemic related testing revenue behind us, I thought this would be a good opportunity to take a step back and take a multi-year view on our meaningful margin expansion progression. Starting in 2019, pre pandemic, excluding the impact of PPD, we're on track to expand operating margins, 60 basis points a year on average through 2023 and 250 basis point improvement over the full year period.It's a great progress on margin expansion. Turning to adjusted EPS. We expect to deliver $23.70 in 2023. This is a 2% year-over-year increase consisting of a 10% headwind from testing more than offset by a 12% increase driven by the core business. We're actively managing the whole P&amp;L to effectively deal with material runoff in testing and vaccines and therapies revenue, and still grow our adjusted earnings per share for the year. This shows the strength of our growth strategy and the power of our PPI business system. Moving on to some more detailed assumptions behind the guide. With regards to FX in 2023, we're assuming it's a year-over-year tailwind of approximately a $100 million of revenue or 0.2% and $0.04 to adjusted EPS also 0.2%. We're assuming that The Binding Site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth and $0.07 to adjusted EPS in 2023.Below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. This approximately $25 million higher than 2022 and includes the funding for the Binding Site acquisition. We assume that the adjusted income tax rate will be 11% in 2023. The improvement from 2022 is driven by a tax planning initiative. We're expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023 and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion for share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count were approximately 388 million shares. We're assuming that we're return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends.And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Revenue adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are all expected to ramp up as we go through the year. This is due to several factors. Core organic revenue growth is expected increase as we go through the year, largely due to the comps related to vaccines and therapies as well as the expected phasing of economic activity in China. The impact of the runoff in testing revenue is most pronounced in Q1 and the benefits of the offsetting cost actions are spread over the year. From a foreign exchange standpoint while a slight tailwind for the year as a whole in Q1, FX is expected to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $200 million of revenue and $80 million of adjusted operating income.Below the line, net interest expense is expected to decrease during the year as we generate free cash flow and interest on that cash build. Putting all this together for Q1, we expect core organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Adjusted operating margin to be slightly lower than Q4 2022 and adjusted EPS to be just over 20% of the full year total. So to wrap up, we had an excellent 2022 and we're really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf.Rafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen.

SQM, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF and Intrepid Potash, Inc. IPI.Industry: FertilizerLink:  https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2048130/3-fertilizer-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-challengesThe Zacks Fertilizers industry is hamstrung by the pullback in fertilizer prices since the second half of 2022 on weaker demand as growers have reduced application rates due to affordability issues. A spike in costs of key raw materials partly due to the war in Ukraine has also put pressure on margins on the companies in this space.  However, favorable agricultural fundamentals and healthy farm economics augur well for the industry. Players in the industry like Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A., CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and Intrepid Potash, Inc. are worth a look despite near-term headwinds.About the IndustryThe Zacks Fertilizers industry comprises producers, distributors and marketers of crop nutrients for the global agriculture industry. Companies in this space offer nutrients such as phosphates (including diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate and phosphoric acid), potash and nitrogen (including urea, ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate) fertilizers. They also provide other nitrogen products to help farmers maximize crop yield.Crop nutrients are essential to drive agricultural productivity and boost the natural fertility of the soil. Demand for these nutrients is being supported by the need to increase the production of grains to address rising food consumption globally. Moreover, the constant need of growers to nourish their crops, replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing global population drives the consumption of fertilizers.What's Shaping the Future of the Fertilizers Industry?Easing Fertilizer Prices: Fertilizer prices surged to historic high levels in the first-half of 2022, riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war that led grain prices shooting to record levels and export curtailments in China to meet domestic demand. Disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus also contributed to the spike. However, prices of phosphate and potash retreated in the back half of the year from their peak levels due to weakening of demand.Story continuesEscalating costs led to growers reducing fertilizer applications or switch to less fertilizer-intensive crops, leading to the demand destruction. Lower fertilizer prices are likely to dent the profitability of companies in this space over the near term.Higher Input Costs a Worry: An uptick in key raw material prices poses a headwind to the companies in this space. Prices of both sulfur and ammonia — key inputs for the production of phosphate — remain elevated. Plant shutdowns and maintenance have led to a tight supply of these raw materials, which coupled with strong demand, has pushed up their prices. Nitrogen fertilizer makers are also bearing the brunt of higher natural gas costs.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to a spike in gas prices in Europe. Natural gas costs are expected to remain higher in Europe over the near term due to the uncertainties surrounding supply from Russia. As such, fertilizer makers are likely to face short-term margin pressure associated with higher input costs.Favorable Agricultural Fundamentals: While the coronavirus pandemic stung a vast spectrum of industries, agriculture was relatively unscathed, given the sustained rise in food demand globally. Moreover, strong global demand coupled with supply constraints boosted crop commodity prices. Higher freight, energy and labor costs and raw material shortages contributed to the upside.Prices of corn, soybean and wheat rallied to multi-year highs in 2022, partly driven by supply worries stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and are likely to remain elevated due to lingering concerns over the war. Higher agricultural commodity prices augur well for crop nutrient demand over the near term. Farmer economics also remain attractive in most global growing regions, aided by a spike in crop commodity prices.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Downbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Fertilizers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #242, which places it in the bottom 3% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects.

A spike in costs of key raw materials partly due to the war in Ukraine has also put pressure on margins on the companies in this space.   However, favorable agricultural fundamentals and healthy farm economics augur well for the industry. Players in the industry like Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. SQM, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF and Intrepid Potash, Inc. IPI are worth a look despite near-term headwinds.About the IndustryThe Zacks Fertilizers industry comprises producers, distributors and marketers of crop nutrients for the global agriculture industry. Companies in this space offer nutrients such as phosphates (including diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate and phosphoric acid), potash and nitrogen (including urea, ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate) fertilizers. They also provide other nitrogen products to help farmers maximize crop yield. Crop nutrients are essential to drive agricultural productivity and boost the natural fertility of the soil. Demand for these nutrients is being supported by the need to increase the production of grains to address rising food consumption globally. Moreover, the constant need of growers to nourish their crops, replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing global population drives the consumption of fertilizers.What's Shaping the Future of the Fertilizers Industry?Easing Fertilizer Prices: Fertilizer prices surged to historic high levels in the first-half of 2022, riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war that led grain prices shooting to record levels and export curtailments in China to meet domestic demand. Disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus also contributed to the spike. However, prices of phosphate and potash retreated in the back half of the year from their peak levels due to weakening of demand. Escalating costs led to growers reducing fertilizer applications or switch to less fertilizer-intensive crops, leading to the demand destruction. Lower fertilizer prices are likely to dent the profitability of companies in this space over the near term.Higher Input Costs a Worry: An uptick in key raw material prices poses a headwind to the companies in this space. Prices of both sulfur and ammonia — key inputs for the production of phosphate — remain elevated. Plant shutdowns and maintenance have led to a tight supply of these raw materials, which coupled with strong demand, has pushed up their prices. Nitrogen fertilizer makers are also bearing the brunt of higher natural gas costs. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to a spike in gas prices in Europe. Natural gas costs are expected to remain higher in Europe over the near term due to the uncertainties surrounding supply from Russia. As such, fertilizer makers are likely to face short-term margin pressure associated with higher input costs.Favorable Agricultural Fundamentals: While the coronavirus pandemic stung a vast spectrum of industries, agriculture was relatively unscathed, given the sustained rise in food demand globally. Moreover, strong global demand coupled with supply constraints boosted crop commodity prices. Higher freight, energy and labor costs and raw material shortages contributed to the upside. Prices of corn, soybean and wheat rallied to multi-year highs in 2022, partly driven by supply worries stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and are likely to remain elevated due to lingering concerns over the war. Higher agricultural commodity prices augur well for crop nutrient demand over the near term. Farmer economics also remain attractive in most global growing regions, aided by a spike in crop commodity prices.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Reflects Downbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Fertilizers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #242, which places it in the bottom 3% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects.

It is benefiting from being the low-cost producer of potassium chloride, potassium sulfate and potassium nitrate. SQM is gaining from favorable trends in the lithium market underpinned by strong electric vehicle sales. The expansion of lithium operations is also supporting the company’s lithium sales volumes. Strong demand and limited supply are also boosting lithium prices. Iodine volumes are also being supported by growing demand following the post-pandemic recovery. These factors have contributed to its share price rally of roughly 83% in a year’s time.Sociedad Quimica, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an expected earnings growth rate of 12.8% for the current year.

CF remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows.CF Industries, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has seen its shares rise roughly 16% over a year, driven by strong demand and pricing fundamentals for nitrogen. CF also has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 6%.Price and Consensus: CF  Intrepid Potash: Colorado-based Intrepid Potash is the only producer of muriate of potash in the United States and also makes a specialty fertilizer, Trio. It is gaining from a strong commodity environment. A recovery in economic activities and the strength in commodity prices are driving demand for its specialty fertilizer, Trio. Higher realized sales prices for potash and Trio are driving IPI’s top line.Intrepid Potash currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

More than 350,000 people suffer out-of-hospital cardiac events each year.1 McMahon's training enabled him to be ready™ for the unexpected and reinforced CPR and AEDs' critical function in saving lives.""What we do matters,"" McMahon said. ""To be involved directly, to see the outcome - and then what comes from the outcome - 100% solidifies what I do for a living.""&gt;&gt; WATCH THE STORY ON YOUTUBE: https://cint.as/3ZYtVf8As McMahon watched his son's summer baseball practice unfold on Aug. 27, 2022, in Fort Mill, S.C., angling his chair along the shaded third-base line for relief from the heat, he had no idea he was about to save a man's life.Batting practice had just begun when McMahon noticed his son's coach, Rem Crawford, face-down on the ground.McMahon raced to Crawford's side. He was not breathing. He had no pulse.""I immediately knew I had some form of relief inside of my truck,"" McMahon said.Because of his sales role in Cintas' First Aid &amp; Safety division, McMahon travels everywhere with an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). The device analyzes a person's heartbeat and issues an electrical shock when detecting an uncoordinated rhythm, and Cintas has helped save more than 600 lives with AEDs provided across the country.The next few minutes were an adrenaline-charged blur. McMahon asked someone to call 911, sent the players into a nearby parking lot away from the scene, bit open the AED pads with his teeth and tore off the cellophane in a frenzy.McMahon's training was a crucial part of the life-saving measures, as he knew how to perform compressions, study real-time feedback from the AED and deliver shocks. Emergency Medical Technicians reinforced the process by phone as they sped toward the diamond.Story continuesAnd then, success.""About 30 to 45 seconds into that second set, Rem comes back to life,"" McMahon said.The incident happened so quickly that Crawford's wife of 19 years, Ember, had yet to arrive. All three Crawford children had gone with Rem to practice while Ember, in a rare instance, had stayed home. She jumped into action when her 13-year-old daughter called in tears.""She said, ‘Dad's on the ground and I don't know what's wrong. They said he's not breathing,'"" Ember said. ""Please come!""Ember rushed out of the house without closing the front door. She spoke briefly by phone with Emergency Medical Services before her daughter called again, this time with good news: Rem was awake and traveling to the hospital via ambulance.Thank you, God, she remembered thinking, that I didn't have to raise my children alone. That they don't have to be without a dad. And that I don't have to do life alone.Ember seized the opportunity to thank the man who'd saved her husband's life when she arrived at the field. Another coach pointed out McMahon, who was pacing.""I'd been OK until then. I was able to pull myself together. And then I walked up and just hugged him and said thank you,"" Ember recounted tearfully.""I was like, ‘No, no, don't thank me. We were at the right place at the right time with the right stuff,"" McMahon said.Ember was convinced her husband would not have survived without McMahon's quick action and accessibility to the AED. Rem spent the next week recovering at the hospital after doctors inserted an internal defibrillator to maintain the rhythm of his heartbeat.In time, Rem was able to recount the circumstances leading to his collapse. He'd been nervous about leading the baseball team - his first head coaching role after years as an assistant coach - and worried about making mistakes.Rem remembered feeling off as batting practice began but couldn't say why. The heat, probably. He became light-headed and began sweating profusely.""I got some water off the bench, came back and that's when it happened. Everything went white. Next thing I know, there's a paramedic above me,"" Rem said. ""Very, very strange. I thought it was a panic attack or something. Exertion. I wasn't quite sure.""He was emotional and grateful after finding out the measures McMahon had taken, and he wanted to meet the man who saved his life. He did a little research from afar, even visiting McMahon's LinkedIn page to learn more about the person he called his hero.They finally met in person at the ballpark in September, less than a month after Rem's heart attack. Ember flagged down McMahon, who approached her car thinking he'd shake her husband's hand.Instead, McMahon and Rem hugged for nearly 45 seconds.""It wasn't a hand-shaking moment,"" McMahon said.They became fast friends as dusk slipped into darkness. The men shared their perspectives of the incident, spoke at length about the AED's impact and even made plans for their families to spend time together over the holidays. What started as quick action by McMahon became an unbreakable bond between two families that continues today.""I can't thank him enough for what he's done for us, for me, for my family, for my future,"" Rem added.About Cintas CorporationCintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing products and services that help keep their customers' facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best.

Although the $1 price tag might look like a deal, you'll pay more per ounce than at Walmart.For example, a 2.9-ounce tube of Crest regular paste costs $1.25 at Dollar Tree, which means you're paying 34 cents per ounce. A pack of three 6-ounce tubes of Colgate costs $4.97 at Walmart, but that's about 27.6 cents per ounce.Shutterstock.comSoap Isn't a StealYou'll pay less per ounce for soap at Walmart than at Dollar Tree. For example, a pack of two 3.2-ounce Irish Spring soap bars costs 19.5 cents per ounce at Dollar Tree. But a 12-pack of 3.7-ounce bars that costs $7.97 at Walmart works out to be just 18 cents per ounce.If you want to stock up on soap, you'll pay $11.48 for a 20-pack of Irish Spring at Sam's Club versus 18 two-bar packs at Dollar Tree priced at $22.50.

This compares to earnings of $1.20 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.65%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $1.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of 1.39%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Microchip Tech , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, posted revenues of $2.17 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.89%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.76 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Microchip Tech shares have added about 15.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Microchip Tech?While Microchip Tech has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Microchip Tech: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.56 on $2.17 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.94 on $8.33 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed is currently in the bottom 20% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Monolithic Power (MPWR), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 8.This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +47.6%.

For the third quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, GAAP net income was adversely impacted by amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with our previous acquisitions.Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was a record at $863.7 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $681.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and losses on the settlement of debt. For the third quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 35.8 cents per share, up 9.1% from the cash dividend paid last quarter and up 41.5% from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 7, 2023 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2023.""We are pleased to report our 9th consecutive revenue growth quarter and another quarter of record operating profit and net income,"" said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our fiscal third quarter revenue grew 4.6% sequentially and 23.4% year-over-year to $2.17 billion. Non-GAAP operating margins came in at 47.5%, which was ahead of our guidance range and above the high-end of our long-term operating model. Our consistent results demonstrate our team's relentless focus on operational excellence, which we believe positions us well to capture market share gains over the business cycle.""Mr. Moorthy added, ""Supply is gradually improving, and for the first time in nine quarters we were able to modestly reduce our large unsupported backlog. We are starting to see improvements in lead times in select technology corridors and remain focused on strategically reducing our unsupported backlog in a disciplined manner, while preserving the quality of the new backlog that gets placed. With gradual supply improvements, we are aiming to better serve our customers by targeting lead times for most of our products to be 26 weeks or less by the second half of 2023. In addition, China's zero COVID policy, and the after-effects of their subsequent rapid lifting of lock-downs, resulted in disruptions which drove higher-than-normal inventory at customers and distributors. We remain cautiously optimistic that we can deliver a soft landing for our business and expect our operating metrics to once again demonstrate resiliency through this business cycle.""Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair, said, “Microchip's Board of Directors approved a sequential increase in our dividend of 9.1% to a record 35.8 cents per share, which represents a 41.5% year-over-year increase. Given our strong cash flow generation during the December quarter, we are targeting to return $469.8 million to our shareholders in the March quarter through dividends and share repurchases, representing 62.5% of our adjusted free cash flow in the December quarter. Our adjusted cash flow excludes $385 million that we collected from our customers or paid to suppliers for long-term supply assurance payments. We are adjusting for these payments since they are refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments. Our board remains committed to increasing cash returns to shareholders, and we are announcing today that since we expect to exit the March quarter with our net leverage below 1.5X we will accelerate the percentage of free cash flow returned. Under this program, starting with the June quarter, we expect to increase the percentage of adjusted free cash flow we return to shareholders every quarter by 500 basis points, until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned which is targeted to occur in approximately eight quarters. Therefore in the June 2023 quarter we now expect to return 67.5% of our adjusted free cash flow from the March quarter to shareholders.""Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, ""We continued to aggressively pay down our debt with another $719.1 million of payments during the December quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of almost $6.2 billion over the past 18 quarters, as we have actively managed the working capital requirements for the business. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.56x for the December quarter. In addition, our capital return strategy is expected to give us the flexibility to continue to pay down high-interest debt. Our operating model has been a strong cash generator and is demonstrating significant operating leverage as we continue on our Microchip 3.0 journey.""Mr. Moorthy concluded, ""Our backlog for the March quarter is strong and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. However, we are also taking active steps to help customers with inventory positions to selectively push out some of their backlog. Considering these factors and the economic backdrop, we expect net sales in the March quarter to be up between 1% and 4% sequentially, and we expect to grow revenue sequentially again in the June quarter. At the mid-point of our guidance for the March quarter, net sales would be 20.6% higher than the year-ago quarter.""Microchip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2022:Introduced new Arm®-based PIC® microcontrollers designed to create an easier way to add Bluetooth® Low Energy Connectivity.

These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Microchip Consolidated GuidanceNet Sales$2.191 to $2.256 billion   GAAPNon-GAAP AdjustmentsNon-GAAP(1)Gross Margin67.8% to 68.0%$6.5 to $7.0 million68.1% to 68.3%Operating Expenses(2)30.3% to 30.7%$215.9 to $219.9 million20.6% to 20.8%Operating Income37.2% to 37.6%$222.4 to $227.4 million47.3% to 47.7%Other Expense, net$45.8 to $48.2 million($0.2) to $0.2 million$46.0 to $48.0 millionIncome Tax Provision$165.1 to $204.1 million(3)$66.1 to $80.7 million$99.0 to $123.4 million(4)Net Income$596.4 to $603.0 million$288.3 to $308.3 million$891.3 to $904.7 millionDiluted Common Shares OutstandingApproximately 554.0 to 554.4 million shares Approximately 554.0 to 554.4 million sharesEarnings per Diluted Share$1.07 to $1.09$0.54$1.61 to $1.63(1) See the ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this release for information regarding our non-GAAP guidance.(2) We are not able to estimate the amount of certain Special Charges and Other, net that may be incurred during the quarter ending March 31, 2023. Therefore, our estimate of GAAP operating expenses excludes certain amounts that may be recognized as Special Charges and Other, net in the quarter ending March 31, 2023.(3) The forecast for GAAP tax expense excludes any unexpected tax events that may occur during the quarter, as these amounts cannot be forecasted.(4) Represents the expected cash tax rate for fiscal 2023, excluding any transition tax payments associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Microchip's inventory days in the March 2023 quarter are expected to be in the range of 157 to 164 days, compared to 152 days on December 31, 2022. Our actual inventory level will depend on the inventory that our distributors decide to hold to support their customers, overall demand for our products, and our production levels.Capital expenditures for the quarter ending March 31, 2023 are expected to be between $154 million and $174 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2023 are expected to be between $525 million and $545 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing capabilities to support the expected growth of our business.Under the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and losses on the settlement of debt. For the third quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items, or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars, including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading ""Supplemental Financial Information""), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the March 2023 quarter between $75 and $80 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY

The top line missed the consensus mark of $16,996 million and our estimate of $16,303.1 million.The weak fourth-quarter results were caused by reduced private equity returns. Lower investment income affected important metrics despite a rising interest rate environment. Reduced profit levels from Asia and MetLife Holdings businesses were concerning.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.MetLife in FocusBased in New York, MetLife (MET) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 0.43%. The insurer is paying out a dividend of $0.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.75% compared to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.02% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.57%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2 is up 1% from last year. MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4.54%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, MetLife's payout ratio is 27%, which means it paid out 27% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MET expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.26 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 20.58%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MetLife Pet Insurance’s new Pet Parent Pulse Survey reveals many people prioritize their furry friends over their human connections, with eight-in-ten pet parents revealing they’d rather spend time with a pet than go on a first date. What’s more – 42% of pet parents surveyed said they would rather have their pet as their Valentine instead of a person.Pets are more than just animal companions. Most respondents (78%) consider their pet to be their child, with 69% stating they love their pet more than some family members.""Love is in the air this Valentine’s Day – and comes in many forms,"" said Brian Jorgensen, Head of Pet Insurance at MetLife. ""Our recent MetLife Pet Insurance survey reveals just how special the companionship and connection between pets and their parents are. In fact, nearly one in six respondents said they tell their pet they love them more than they tell their partner!""As part of the survey findings, single pet parents were more likely than married pet parents to prefer pet companionship to human interaction (82% to 75%, respectively). Additionally, Millennials (25-40-year-olds) were also more likely than older pet parents to prefer spending free time with their pets instead of people (83% of Millennials compared to 71% of pet parents aged 57 and up). Divorced/separated pet parents, by contrast, were most split in their perspective, with just over half indicating they would prefer a pet Valentine over a human one.While there is no question that the bond between pet parents and their animal companions is strong, over half of pet parents (54%) worry about being able to care for their pet in the future with current economic uncertainties. Pets can be expensive – beyond the Valentine’s Day gifts. The average pet parent will spend just under $1,500 a year, with the biggest expense after food being vet care. To support these pet parents, MetLife Pet Insurance offers an array of pet insurance plans that allow them to take the steps necessary to safeguard their pet’s health while also easing their financial burden.Story continues""Every year, Valentine’s Day serves as a loving reminder to spend time with those we care about most. As our survey shows, this includes pets,"" Jorgensen explains. ""One of the greatest acts of love a pet parent can take is to ensure the health and safety of their pet.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Gartner (NYSE:IT). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Gartner with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Gartner How Quickly Is Gartner Increasing Earnings Per Share?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Gartner's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 51%. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Gartner maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 16% to US$5.3b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$858m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!Does Gartner Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Gartner's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Gartner very closely.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Largest Petrochemical Companies in the World.Petrochemicals are an essential part of our daily lives because of their ability to transform oil and gas into a variety of everyday products like plastics, fertilizers, packaging, apparel, digital devices, medical equipment, detergents, and tires. They are used in many components of the contemporary energy system, including solar panels, wind turbine blades, batteries, thermal insulation for buildings, electric car components, and essential items for our daily lives. Petrochemicals are becoming ever more crucial to the global energy system, where they already play a significant role. Since the turn of the millennium, demand for plastics, the most well-known petrochemical goods, has exceeded that of all other bulk materials (such as steel, aluminum, or cement). However, the industry has been in the headlines recently as it contributes to global carbon emissions, and climate activists have been pushing for the industry to move towards more sustainable production.The global petrochemical market size is projected to be valued at $798.8 billion by 2030, increasing from $523.56 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 5.4%. The U.S. Energy Information Agency’s International Energy Outlook projects that fossil fuels will supply 60% of primary energy consumption globally in 2050. The United States is a leader in the low-cost production of petrochemicals. Petrochemicals industrial production in the country is expected to be worth $79.8 billion in 2022 and is largely concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina.Largest Petrochemical Companies tcly / shutterstock.comAccording to the Energy Information Administration, USA's operable crude refining capacity was 17.94 million b/d on January 1, 2022, down from 18.09 million b/d at the start of 2021 and a record high of 18.98 million b/d in 2020 before the pandemic took hold. The estimate for 2022 is the lowest since 14.92 million b/d in 2014. EIA also mentions that refinery capacity might be lower than this figure because of the capacity reductions announced later in 2022. S&amp;P Global suggests various reasons for these refinery closures, including storm damage, pandemic effects, high operating costs, failure to finalize sales, lower future demand predictions, or conversions to generate more renewable fuels.Story continuesMoreover, the United States has not built any new refining capacity in decades. The last major refinery in the US came into operation in 1977 in Louisiana. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth made headlines last year when he stated that the United States would never build another refinery. His reasoning was simple: the national policy has been to restrict demand for petrochemicals, making this sector unappealing to investors, given that it takes a decade to recover the initial cost of building a refinery. His views are not incorrect; governments all over the world have been helping the electric vehicle industry to reduce the demand for petrochemicals. According to IHS Markit research, US oil and liquids demand might fall by around 25% from 20.3 million barrels per day in 2019 to an anticipated 15.3 million b/d in 2050. According to IHS's low-carbon policy scenario, US oil demand for transportation might fall to 7 million b/d by 2050. Globally, Equinor ASA predicts that demand for oil for transportation will shrink 47% between 2018 and 2050 if current trends continue, thanks to advances in fuel efficiency and electric vehicles.In the near future, the petrochemical industries of the Middle East and China will be the center of attention, with the EIA estimating that they will lead refining capacity increases in 2022 and 2023. The Saudi government is also pushing for a stronger presence in the downstream petrochemical industry to reduce its reliance on crude oil. To achieve this goal, Saudi Arabia has signed several deals with China to collaborate on various projects in the downstream oil business. Although most analysts believe that demand for petrochemicals will fall in the long term as the global economy shifts to more renewable resources, both the demand and supply of petrochemicals will increase in the next few years. According to McKinsey, continued growth in crucial end markets that utilize petrochemicals, such as packaging and construction, as well as economic development in China, India, and Southeast Asia, will boost demand. Meanwhile, the consulting firm expects supply to grow at a robust rate. However, in the ethylene market category, which dominates the petrochemicals industry, McKinsey predicts capacity to rise faster than demand, lowering profit margins in this segment.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 20 largest petrochemical companies in the world, we identified the biggest petrochemicals companies in major economies and ranked these companies in ascending order in order of their market cap.

59,4f9d8ca7-6e02-38bc-8848-4b44a59c1158,O,2023-02-03,China boosts imports of fuel oil blended from Russian barrels,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-boosts-imports-fuel-oil-031147759.html,1675393907,STORY,['CL=F'],"[By Chen Aizhu and Jeslyn LerhSINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's independent refineries are ramping up imports of discounted fuel oil blended from Russian barrels to use as low-cost feedstock amid a shortage of government crude oil import quotas for some of them, according to trade sources and data.Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including the looming Feb. 5 embargo and price cap on refined products, have been pushing Russian fuel oil barrels eastward into Asia at attractive discounts since last year.These have been flooding the ship-to-ship transfer hubs of Malaysia and United Arab Emirates' Fujairah since the second quarter of 2022. Traders blend these barrels with other oils to rebrand the fuel oil's country of origin, clearing the way for ship insurance and financing that would otherwise be banned under the sanctions, trade sources said.Discounts offered on these fuel oil cargoes help to improve margins at Chinese independent refiners and replace crude that some companies are unable to import without quotas, the sources said. The trade also provides a way to get Russian oil to market and bring much-needed export earnings to Moscow.""We've been looking at Russian fuel oil since December. It is cheap and does not require (crude) import quotas,"" said an executive with an independent refiner in eastern Shandong province.The refiner has not received any government crude quotas for the past year or so and buys mostly straight-run fuel oil to produce diesel and gasoline, said the executive, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.These blended fuel oil barrels were last traded at about a $5 discount to benchmark crude ICE Brent on a delivered Shandong basis, said one source.High-sulphur fuel oil values relative to crude have plunged into deeper discounts since the second quarter last year, with cracks hitting record lows at end-October.China's total fuel oil imports surged to about 1.76 million tonnes in December, highest since September 2021, official customs data showed.Story continuesThe uptick was driven by a surge in shipments from Malaysia to more than a one-year high at 620,000 tonnes, while monthly imports from UAE rose to 471,000 tonnes, highest in two years.Meanwhile, direct imports of fuel oil from Russia slipped to 187,000 tonnes in December after peaking at 554,000 tonnes in October, even as total imports from Russia more than doubled year-on-year to 3.1 million tonnes in 2022.China’s fuel oil imports from Malaysia and the UAE surge in Q4 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lgpdknwqavo/China's%20fuel%20oil%20imports.png""The deep discounts offered are driving the trend as independent refiners are price sensitive. China is still recovering, with domestic demand for refined fuels uncertain,"" said Emril Jamil, Refinitiv's senior analyst for crude and fuel oil.""The trend will continue with the EU ban (on Feb. 5), with all natural outlets in Europe closed. Asia will continue to soak up cheaper Russian (fuel oil) barrels on top of crude,"" Jamil said.TRADING COMPANIESWestern trading houses have been the main suppliers of these fuel oil shipments to China, said four senior trading sources, who closely track the flows, adding that the elevated December levels will extend through February and beyond.One of the top suppliers channelling these barrels to China is Swiss-based trader Vitol, they said.Over the last four months, Brilliant Jewel, a floating storage facility chartered by Vitol, conducted ship-to-ship transfer operations with at least six vessels that previously loaded fuel at Russian ports, a Reuters analysis of shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.Vitol did not respond to a request for comment.A second Chinese fuel oil trader said companies have become more relaxed in dealing with Russian barrels after initial confusion over the Group of Seven price cap and the potential risk of running afoul of sanctions.""Initially the market took a wait-and-see stance before Dec. 5, but now many traders are moving fuel oil from these two hubs, with the top western traders being the more active,"" said the trader.Leading Chinese bunker suppliers and traders like Sinopec and PetroChina's Chimbusco have also been sending more Russian high-sulphur fuel oil to bunkering hubs in eastern China's Zhoushan and Qingdao, sources said.Sinopec and Chimbusco did not respond to requests for comment.Shipping records show the companies have chartered several fuel oil shipments from Malaysia's Tanjung Pelepas port to Zhoushan and Hong Kong over the last four months.(Reporting by Chen Aizhu and Jeslyn Lerh; Editing by Florence Tan and Tom Hogue)]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis marketing and advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +24.4%.Revenues are expected to be $2.56 billion, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.38% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Interpublic?For Interpublic, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.49%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Interpublic will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Interpublic would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering a surprise of +6.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Interpublic doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry, Omnicom (OMC), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.94 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.69 billion, down 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Omnicom has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.75%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Omnicom will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: FE) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell an additional 30% ownership interest in its FirstEnergy Transmission, LLC (FET) business to Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners (Brookfield). Upon closing of the transaction, proceeds from the $3.5 billion all-cash deal will further strengthen FirstEnergy's financial position and support its goal to be a premier utility with sustainable, long-term growth as it enables the clean energy transition.FirstEnergy Corp.

""This agreement efficiently raises capital at an attractive valuation and speaks to the strength and potential of our regulated growth strategies. It positions FirstEnergy to drive value for shareholders as we further optimize our financial position and plan for additional smart grid and clean energy investments in our regulated transmission and distribution businesses.""Story continuesDuring 2022, FirstEnergy reduced holding company debt by $2.5 billion, or more than 30% compared to year-end 2021. Proceeds from this second transaction with Brookfield will be used to accelerate improvements in the company's credit profile as it targets a funds-from-operations to debt ratio of 14-15%, consistent with strong investment-grade companies.Additionally, FirstEnergy today announced it has increased its 2021-2025 long-term growth plan to nearly $18 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion from the $17 billion target established in 2021. Later this year, the company plans to provide an updated long-term growth forecast, which will include additional investments to support a more resilient and modern grid and the transition to a low-carbon future. FirstEnergy plans to provide full year 2023 guidance and other financial updates when it releases fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings on February 13.""This additional investment in FirstEnergy Transmission demonstrates our commitment to building strong partnerships with premier infrastructure asset owners and operators, like FirstEnergy, that share our focus on long-term value creation,"" said Eduardo Salgado, Managing Partner in Brookfield's Infrastructure Group and head of Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners (BSIP).

(CRM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-trending-stock-140002644.html,1675346402,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +23.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.36 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%. This estimate has changed +5.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 indicates a change of +17.2% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.63 billion and $33.98 billion estimates indicate +15.6% and +10.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.2%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.27 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.39%. The EPS surprise was +15.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.5%.Revenues are expected to be $1.46 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sealed Air?For Sealed Air, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.13%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sealed Air will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sealed Air would post earnings of $0.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.98, delivering a surprise of +7.69%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Sealed Air doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry, Sonoco (SON) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +40%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.8 billion, up 25% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Sonoco has been revised 13.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.20%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sonoco will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SNA grew more than 2% before the trading session on Feb 2, following better-than-expected top and bottom lines in fourth-quarter 2022. Moreover, sales and earnings advanced year over year.Results have gained from a continued positive business momentum and contributions from its Value Creation plan despite the tough environment. Management is on track with its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives.Shares of SNA have gained 13.5% in the past three months compared with the industry's 10.7% rally. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q4 HighlightsSnap-on’s earnings of $4.42 per share in fourth-quarter 2022 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.09 and our estimate of $3.94. The figure also improved 7.8% from earnings of $4.10 reported in the prior-year quarter.Net sales grew 4.3% to $1,155.9 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,151 million and our estimate of $1,150.1 million. The increase can be attributed to organic sales growth of 8%, which also came ahead of our estimate of 6.1% growth. This was somewhat offset by $37.7 million of negative impacts of foreign-currency translations. Sales and organic sales grew 21% and 22.7%, respectively, from the pre-pandemic levels of 2019.The gross profit of $560.7 million improved 5.1% year over year, while the gross margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 48.5% in the reported quarter.The company’s operating earnings before financial services totaled $248 million, up 6.8% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 50 bps to 21.5% in the fourth quarter.

As a percentage of sales, operating earnings were flat year over year at 25.1%.Story continuesSegmental DetailsSales in Commercial &amp; Industrial Group declined 4.3% from the prior-year quarter to $343.2 million on a negative currency impact of $21.2 million. This was partly offset by organic sales growth of 1.7%. Organic growth was aided by higher sales in the segment’s specialty tools business and sales growth in critical industries, partly offset by the segment’s Europe-based hand tools business.The Tools Group segment’s sales rose 7.5% year over year to $542.7 million, driven by organic sales growth of 9.6%, offset by a $9.5-million negative impact of foreign currency. Robust sales in the U.S. and international operations aided organic sales.Sales in Repair Systems &amp; Information Group advanced 11.6% year over year to $437.9 million, with organic sales growth of 14.3%. Sales gains were somewhat offset by a $9.5-million negative impact of foreign currency. Strong sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and a rise in sales of under-car equipment contributed to segment organic sales growth. Increased activities with OEM dealerships also aided the segment’s results.The Financial Services business’ revenues rose 1.6% year over year to $88.3 million in the quarter.FinancialsAs of 2022 end, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $757.2 million, with long-term debt of $1,183.8 million and shareholders’ equity (before non-controlling interest) of $4,481.3 million.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?Story continuesJoseph Hogan: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q4 financial performance and comment on our views for 2023. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. You'll note that we have shortened our formal remarks in order to leave more time for Q&amp;A. Overall, I'm pleased to report fourth quarter results that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients than the recent quarters, especially in the Americas and EMEA regions, as well as parts of APAC.For Q4, trends in consumer interest for orthodontic treatment, patient traffic in doctors' practices and iTero scanner demos improved. However, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results reduced our revenues and margins significantly. Despite the large impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, Q4 revenues of $901.5 million, increased sequentially from Q3, reflecting growth in Systems and Services as well as a slight increase in Clear Aligner shipments. This is the first quarter in a year that our total revenues and Clear Aligner volumes increased sequentially. As we move through 2023 and hopeful that we'll see continued stability in an improving operating environment, but remind everyone that the macroeconomic situation remains fragile.Regardless, we are confident in our large untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. We anticipate 2023 will be an exciting year for new innovation at Align, and we'll begin to commercialize one of the largest new product and technology cycles in our 25-year history. The Q4 Systems and Services revenue of $169.9 million were up 7.8% sequentially and down 21.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, Q4 Systems and Services revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million or 1.5% sequentially and approximately $11.2 million or 6.2% year-over-year. For Q4, Systems and Services revenues increased sequentially, driven by growth in the Americas and EMEA regions, reflecting continued sales of intraoral scanners, especially the iTero 5D.Q4 sequential growth also reflects continued growth of our scanner rental programs as well as initial deployment of a certified preowned, what we call CPO scanner leasing rental program with desktop metal, that I'll describe in more detail shortly. We continue to develop new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers, and DSO partners, which is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade to make trade-ins to provide refurbished scanners for emerging markets. We expect to continue rolling out programs such as leasing and rental offerings that help customers in the current macroeconomic environment by leveraging our balance sheet and selling the way our customers want to buy.On a year-over-year basis, Q4 services revenues increased primarily due to increased subscription revenue, resulting in a larger number of field scanners. We also had higher non-case systems revenues related to our scanner leasing rental programs previously mentioned. To help accelerate the adoption of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, in Q4, we announced a strategic collaboration with Desktop Metal to supply iTero Element Flex scanners to Desktop Labs, one of the largest lab networks in the U.S. serving general dentists. The iTero Element Flex is now the preferred restorative scanner for desktop labs and will connect dentists directly to a suite of offerings from desktop labs that simplifies the digital design and manufacture restorations with both traditional and digital technologies.Our collaboration with Desktop Metal reflects our commitment to a relationship we expect will evolve and expand to being advanced restorative workflows to market. We see significant opportunities to enable dentists to use scan data directly order restorative services or printed ready digital files from Desktop Labs that can be used for 3D printing in their offices. In addition to iTero scanners, we're also excited about extending the benefits of the Align Digital Platform, including the Invisalign System and Exocad software to Desktop Labs' customers as well. For Q4, total Clear Aligner revenues of $731.7 million were down slightly, 0.2% sequentially and down 10.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, for Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of $13.4 million or 1.8% sequentially and $56.4 million or 7.2% year-over-year.Q4 total Clear Aligner volumes of $583,000 was up slightly sequentially, reflecting growth in the Americas and EMEA regions, offset by lower APAC volumes primarily in China. For the Americas, Q4 Clear Aligner volumes were down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower ortho cases, especially teen starts as compared to the typical higher teen season in Q3. Offset primarily by an increase in adult patients from the GP dentist channel. For Q4, Clear Aligner volume from DSO customers continue to outpace non-DSO customers. For EMEA, Q4 Clear Aligner volume increased sequentially in all markets and across products, especially recently launched Invisalign Moderate, iGO Plus and iGO Express, which enabled GP dentists to treat a broader range of cases, mild-to-moderate types of malocclusions and can easily be integrated in a wide range of restorative treatments in a dental practice.EMEA had a strong sequential growth in the teen market segment with continued demand for Invisalign Teen case packs, which are available in France and Iberia as well as Invisalign's first treatment for kids as young as 6 years old. APAC, Q4 Clear Aligner volumes were lower sequentially due primarily to China, which continues to be impacted by COVID. In Q4, ongoing COVID restrictions and lockdowns in China persisted throughout the quarter. Outside of China, APAC volumes increased sequentially led by Japan, Taiwan, India and Southeast Asia markets. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner case volumes reflected increased shipments led by Korea, India, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. While the easing of COVID restrictions in China and the more recent downward trend in COVID infection rates are encouraging, many uncertainties remain, including the lingering impacts from COVID across the population and the time and effort needed to restore consumer confidence.For the other non-case revenues, which include retention products such as our Vivera Retainers, clinical training and education, accessories, e-commerce, and a new subscription programs such as our DSP, fourth quarter revenues were down slightly sequentially and up double digits year-over-year. For retention and e-commerce products, Q4 revenues were relatively unchanged from Q3. We are pleased with our subscription-based programs like DSP, which increased sequentially and year-over-year and expect to continue expanding DSP offerings in other regions. For Q4, the total number of new Invisalign trained doctors decreased sequentially due primarily to fourth quarter being a seasonally slower period for clinical education with holidays, et cetera, as well as fewer trainings in China and Brazil.This was offset by somewhat significantly higher numbers of new Invisalign doctors trained in EMEA. Teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for Clear Aligner sales to orthos. We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through team specific sales and marketing programs and product features, including Invisalign First for kids, as young as 6, which was up sequentially across all markets. For Q4, total Clear Aligner teen cases were down sequentially due primarily to the impact of COVID in China as well as seasonally fewer team starts in North America as compared to Q3. According to the December gauge report, which tracks approximately 1,000 orthos in the United States and Canada, new patient exams for teens slowed in Q4, while new patient exams for adults improved slightly.A smaller pool of potential teen patients may put pressure on traditional orthos and cause them to go between clear aligners and wires and brackets, especially those practices that have failed to understand the significant benefits of adopting more efficient digital workflows, believing metal braces are more profitable. In EMEA, Q4 was a record quarter for teen case starts. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 teen case starts were relatively unchanged. For Q4, Invisalign First increased year-over-year and was strong across all regions. Invisalign First Clear Aligner treatment is designed for predictive results and a positive experience while addressing the unique needs of growing children from as young as 6 to treat Phase I. For the full year, Invisalign Clear aligner shipments for teens and young kids was approximately 733,000 cases, our teen case mix overall was a record 31% of Invisalign cases shipped for the year.Finally, in Q4, the total number of doctors shipped was 82, 900 doctors, a slight decrease due primarily to the impact of COVID in China and off our Q3 '22 high point, which included a major DSO onboarding in North America. For the full year 2023, we also shipped to the highest cumulative number of Invisalign trained doctors over 124,000 doctors, reinforcing our commitment to doctor-directed care for Clear Aligner treatment to achieve the safest and best possible clinical treatment outcomes for patients. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.John Morici: Thanks, Joe. Before I go through the details of our Q4 results, I want to comment on 2 items in our fourth quarter financial results. Restructuring and other charges, during Q4 2022, we incurred a total of $14.3 million of restructuring and other charges, of which $2.9 million was included in the cost of net revenues and $11.5 million included in operating expenses. Restructuring and other charges included $8.7 million of severance-related costs and $5.6 million of certain lease terminations and asset impairments, primarily related to rightsizing operations in Russia in light of business needs. Second, non-GAAP tax rate. In Q4 2022, we changed to a long-term projected tax rate for our non-GAAP provision for income taxes.Dentist, Medicine, TeethPhoto by Atikah Akhtar on UnsplashOur previous methodology for calculating our non-GAAP effective tax rates included certain nonrecurring and period-specific items. That produced fluctuating effective tax rates that management does not believe are reflective of the company's long-term effective tax rate. We have recast non-GAAP results for our provision for income taxes. Effective tax rate, net income and diluted net income per share for each reporting period in 2022 to reflect this change. We did not make any changes to the results reported for 2021 as reflecting the change in our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results. Refer to the section in our Q4 press release titled Recast financial measures for prior periods in 2022 for a tax rate change under unaudited GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for further information.Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $901.5 million, up 1.3% from the prior quarter and down 12.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q4 2022 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $16 million or approximately 1.7% sequentially and approximately $67.6 million year-over-year or approximately 7%. For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of $731.7 million were flat sequentially, primarily from lower ASPs, mostly offset by higher volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were down 10.3% and primarily due to lower volumes and lower ASPs, partially offset by higher non-case revenues. For Q4, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were flat sequentially and decreased year-over-year.On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners and product mix shift. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in comprehensive ASPs reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix shift and higher discounts partially offset by higher additional aligners and per order processing fees. For Q4, Invisalign ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment decreased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflect product mix shift, unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and higher discounts, partially offset by higher additional aligners. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in ASPs reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by higher additional aligners and per order processing fees.As we mentioned last quarter, as our revenues from subscriptions, retainers and other ancillary products continue to grow and expand globally, some of the historical metrics that focus only on case shipments do not account for our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we've added our total Clear Aligner revenue per case shipment, which is more indicative of our overall growth strategy. Clear Aligner's deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $56.4 million or 4.8% sequentially and $171.9 million or up 16.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q4 2022 Systems and Services revenues of $169.9 million were up 7.8% sequentially, primarily due to higher scanner volume, services and exocad revenues, partially offset by lower ASPs and were down 21.3% year-over-year primarily due to lower scanner volume and ASPs, partially offset by higher services revenue from our larger installed base of scanners and increased nonsystem revenues related to our certified preowned and leasing and rental programs.Q4 2022 Systems and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million or approximately 1.5% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, System and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $11.2 million or approximately 6.2%. The Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $9 million or 3.4% sequentially and up $42.9 million or 18.7% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 68.5%, down 1 point sequentially and down 3.7 points year-over-year.Overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange on our revenues by approximately 0.6 points sequentially and 2.2 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.8%, down 0.1 point sequentially due to lower ASPs and higher warranty and restructuring costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing absorption and lower training costs. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was down 3.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower ASPs, increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 58.8%, down 4.6 points sequentially due to lower ASPs and higher inventory costs and manufacturing inefficiencies, partially offset by higher services revenues and lower freight costs.Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was down 5.9 points year-over-year for the reasons stated previously. Q4 operating expenses were $505 million, up sequentially 6.2% and down 3.6% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $29.5 million, mainly due to restructuring and other charges and our continued investment in sales and R&amp;D activities, along with higher consulting expenses. Year-over-year, operating expenses decreased by $18.6 million primarily due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs as well as lower incentive compensation, partially offset by restructuring and other charges. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were up were $459.7 million, up 3.7% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year.Our fourth quarter operating income of $112.7 million resulted in an operating margin of 12.5%, down 3.6 points sequentially and down 8.9 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by 0.9 points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange and lower gross margin. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 4.2 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 18.3%, down 1.9 points sequentially and down 6.4 points year-over-year.Interest and other income expense net for the fourth quarter was income of $2.7 million compared to a loss of $21 million in the third quarter and a loss of $0.9 million in Q4 of 2021, primarily due to net foreign exchange gains from the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. The GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 63.8% compared to 40.7% in the third quarter and 13.2% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to decreased earnings in low tax jurisdictions as -- and an increase in the amount of U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20% in the fourth quarter and reflects the change in our methodology that was discussed earlier.Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior year in 2021, which does not reflect the change in our methodology. Fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $0.54, down sequentially $0.39 and down $1.86 compared to the prior year. Our earnings per share was unfavorably impacted by $0.04 on a sequential basis and $0.22 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $1.73 for the fourth quarter, up $0.10 sequentially and down $1.10 year-over-year. Note that the prior year 2021 non-GAAP net income per diluted share or prior year 2021 EPS does not reflect the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet.As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1 billion, down sequentially $99.5 million and down $255.1 million year-over-year. Of our $1 billion balance $387.9 million was held in the U.S. and $653.7 million was held by our international entities. In October 2022, we purchased approximately 848,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $188.62 per share through a $200 million accelerated share repurchase under our May 2021, $1 billion stock repurchase program. We have $250 million remaining available for repurchase under this program, and we plan to repurchase this remaining amount starting in Q1 2023 through either -- either or a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement, completing the repurchases in Q2 of 2023.Q4 accounts receivable balance was $859.7 million, flat sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, down 1 day sequentially and up approximately 7 days as compared to Q4 last year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $144.7 million, Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $91.5 million. We exited fiscal 2022 with a strong balance sheet, including $1 billion in cash and investments, a healthy cash flow position and no long-term debt. As we announced with our earnings, Align's Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the current $1 billion program.This new $1 billion program reflects the strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow generation as well as management and our board's continued confidence in our ability to capitalize on large market opportunities in our target markets and trajectory for growth while concurrently returning capital to our shareholders. Now turning to our outlook. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q4 results and what appears to be a more stable environment in North America and EMEA. We are cautiously optimistic for continued stability and improving trends as we move through the year. However, the macroeconomic environment remains fragile. And given continued global challenges in the and uncertainty, we are not providing full year revenue guidance.We would like to see improvements in the operating environment and consumer demand signals, including stability in China before revisiting our approach. At the same time, we are confident in our large, untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry and our ability to make progress towards our strategic initiatives. We intend to focus on the things we can control and influence, which includes strategic investments in sales, marketing, technology and innovation. For full year 2023, assuming no additional material disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 20%. With this backdrop for Q1 2023, we anticipate Clear Aligner volumes to be down sequentially, primarily due to weakness in China from COVID, partially offset by some stability from our Americas and EMEA regions.We anticipate Clear Aligner ASPs to be up from Q4 2022, primarily due to higher pricing and non-favorable and favorable foreign exchange rates. We anticipate iTero scanner and services revenue to be down sequentially as the business follows a more typical capital equipment cycle. Taken in total, we expect Q1 2023 revenues to be about flat to Q4 of 2022. We expect our Q1 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be consistent with our Q4 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as we continue to make investments in R&amp;D and other go-to-market activities. For 2023, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $200 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion.With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?Joseph Hogan: Thanks, John. In closing, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results and the improved trends in sequential growth we saw in the Americas and EMEA regions and parts of APAC that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients. While still very early and many uncertainties remain, we're hopeful that we'll see continued stability across the business and regions, especially in China. As we continue to work through these challenges, we're confident in our ability to focus on our customers and deliver key technology and innovation that furthers our leadership position in digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry. We are balancing investments to deliver shareholder value through transformative digital orthodontic solutions unique to Align.Align is a purpose-driven business, and we are committed to helping doctors transform smiles and change lives of millions of people around the world. Over the last year, we have flooded our customer base with a lot of new technology that represents one of the largest new product cycles in our history. But there is still a great deal of room for innovation. In the next 1 to 3 years, you should expect to see new platforms from us that will continue to revolutionize doctors' practices and patients' expectations for doctor-led treatment. And scanning, making it simpler and faster. In software, saving both doctors and patients more time with improved clinical outcomes. In direct 3D printing, an evolution in both product and material science. These 3 platforms will give doctors tools only dreamt of before with a singular focus to make the Invisalign system the standard of orthodontic and restorative care, and we couldn't be more excited about it.Thank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.

Meanwhile, market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported sales jump of about 30% during the same period.Times, though, have changed.Growth at AWS slowed to a record low of 20% in the last three months of 2022 to $21.4 billion, slightly missing analysts' estimates of $22.03 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Microsoft's revenue in its so-called intelligent cloud business that includes Azure rose 18% to beat expectations for October to December. But its current-quarter forecast of $21.7 billion to $22 billion was below estimates of $22.14 billion.""The deceleration in AWS was even worse than expected and means Amazon can't rely on that business units' operating profits as much in coming quarters,"" said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.Story continuesAmazon finance chief Brian Olsavsky said on Thursday that the company expects slower cloud growth rates for the next few quarters. That echoed Microsoft, which said last week that growth in its Azure cloud-computing business would slow by 4-5 basis points in the March quarter.""You've just come off two years of rapid movement of workloads to the cloud, there's probably a lot of inefficiency in cloud spending and now there is a shifting focus to greater efficiency,"" said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.AI SILVER LININGA potential boom in AI after the viral success of OpenAI's ChatGPT could boost demand for cloud services again though, analysts said. AI applications require massive computing power, a boon for companies whose services help run the technology.As an investor and partner of OpenAI, Microsoft looks well poised, analysts said, but any gains may take time to translate into profits.""Those (AI) advancements and demand for related cloud services will take time to materialize. They're not likely to offset current headwinds in the enterprise market over the next few quarters,"" Lipsman said.(Reporting by Aditya Soni, Yuvraj Malik, Akash Sriram and Tiyashi Datta in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)]"

(NASDAQ:PAYX) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Paychex investors that purchase the stock on or after the 8th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of February.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.79 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.16 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Paychex stock has a trailing yield of around 2.6% on the current share price of $120.6. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Paychex Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Paychex paid out more than half (74%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (73%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Paychex's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. Paychex has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Paychex has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.5% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Paychex worth buying for its dividend? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. However, we'd also note that Paychex is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Paychex from a dividend perspective.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Paychex is facing. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Paychex that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

94,2bebc52b-a90e-36d3-8407-4247ddd10f7a,SBUX,2023-02-03,UPDATE 1-Tech earnings hit pause button on market rally,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-tech-earnings-hit-pause-121046852.html,1675426246,STORY,"['AAPL', 'AMZN', 'SBUX']","[(Updates shares)By Caroline Valetkevitch and Herbert LashFeb 3 (Reuters) - Big Tech led U.S. markets on a sharp rebound to kick off 2023. The message from their earnings on Thursday: not so fast.Apple Inc, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon.com all posted results for the end-of-year quarter that left a sour taste in investors' mouths. The reports renewed questions about global economic demand, the effect of higher interest rates and whether the market's January rally got ahead of itself.Nascent signs that consumer spending was beginning to rebound in China were not enough to change that.Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company, fell short of expectations, hurt by lower iPhone sales and production disruptions in China. Amazon said operating profits could fall this quarter due to lower demand, and Alphabet's online advertisers cut back their spend as well.Shares of Amazon dropped about 5%, while Alphabet retreated nearly 2%, on course to collectively shed nearly $93 billion from their respectively market valuations. Apple reversed early losses to trade 3.5% higher.""Maybe the tech stocks rallied a little bit too much into these numbers, so the market will be taking a deep breath and saying, 'OK, well these companies aren't bulletproof,'"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, Georgia.These three firms and Microsoft, the four U.S. companies with trillion-dollar market values, have led the broad-market S&amp;P 500 in 2023. The index is up nearly 9% year-to-date, with Amazon gaining 34%. Big Tech surged Thursday following a strong quarterly report from Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc.That's after the group was battered throughout 2022, trailing the S&amp;P, which dropped nearly 20%.David Trainer, chief executive of New Constructs in Nashville, Tennessee, said not enough people in the market are paying attention to company fundamentals.Story continues""We're in a speculator's market, not an investor's,"" he said, noting recent trading in retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which is expected to file for bankruptcy soon. ""What we've seen in January and late December was a huge increase in liquidity and a return to the meme stock way.""Some investors saw silver linings from Apple and other bellwethers, including Starbucks, that reported results on Thursday. They noted that lockdowns in China strangled sales for many companies in the world's second-biggest economy, expecting a rebound in the coming year.""When things started to reopen in December (in China), we did see an increase in traffic to our stores as compared to November and an increase in demand as December rolled around,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters.Cook said lockdowns in China hurt both production and demand, and the company faced headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar that pushed revenues lower.""Currency was a headwind but will be a tailwind in Q1,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments in Scottsdale, Arizona, referring to the dollar's weakening trajectory.""The supply chain was a problem more so than demand, and that seems to have been right-sized.""Similarly, Starbucks said comparable sales fell 29% from the previous year in China, the company's fastest-growing market, but that beginning in January, it saw ""very encouraging"" recovery momentum there.Other U.S. consumer bellwethers painted a mixed picture. Consumer staples giant Clorox said product volumes fell in three of the company's four business segments in the fourth quarter, while automaker Ford said the year ahead was going to be a difficult one.They, and other companies, are still grappling with higher interest rates that are slowing demand. This year's surge in stocks has been built on a rally in bonds, as lower yields make high-valuation shares more attractive. Cost-cutting by Alphabet and Meta led some investors to think that interest rates are affecting demand.""In many respects we're waiting for that other shoe to drop – the impact of higher rates on the economy, inflation, earnings and jobs,"" said Jack Ablin, co-founder and chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, which manages $30 billion. ""Profits tend to trough nine months after overnight rates peak and we haven't even seen the peak in overnight rates yet.""(Reporting By Herbert Lash, Caroline Valetkevitch and David Gaffen; writing by David Gaffen; Editing by Peter Henderson and Cynthia Osterman)]"

And so the problem is behind us.”Meanwhile, Starbucks CEO Howard Schulz said “covid-related headwinds that unfolded in China,” such as suppressed mobility in the region, had a big hand in its poor performance.

And that followed through to demand as well. And I don’t want to get into January…But we did see a marked change from December compared to November.” —Apple CEO Tim CookWill Apple and Starbucks reduce dependence on China?Apple’s Cook said the company builds its products “everywhere” adding that “component parts coming from many different countries in the world, and the final assembly coming from three countries in the world on just iPhone.” It is indeed trying to shift some manufacturing to India and Vietnam, but China, the world’s largest factory, still does the bulk of the work. The relaxation of China’s zero-covid policy is good news for Apple.Unlike the Cupertino company, Starbucks isn’t benefiting massively from the reopening. Despite the rule relaxations, fewer people are picking up Starbucks coffees at stores due to widespread covid outbreaks. The Seattle-based coffee chain does not have “clear line of sight into the timing of recovery” and believes sales will continue to decline through this quarter, chief financial officer Rachel Ruggeri said on the earnings call. Recovery is only expected in the back half of fiscal 2023.But there are some glimpses of hope already. For instance, in January, China’s comparable sales growth was a decline of approximately 15%, a significant improvement from a decline of 42% in December.For Starbucks, which opened its first Beijing store in 1999, China is a key market outside North America and it has made great efforts to woo the nation: It has tweaked its food menu to offer products that cater to local traditions and tastes. The company owns every store in the country. (By contrast, it owns only 59% of its US stores.) And its ambitious plan for China store openings—9,000 stores in 300 cities by 2025, focussed on smaller cities—still “remains unchanged,” according to Ruggeri.Related stories🇮🇳 Apple’s $2.5 billion iPhone shipments from India hint at a major manufacturing shift🏪 Starbucks is opening more than a store a day in China and only plans to get faster there📍 The countries with the most Starbucks locationsMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Those policy changes were then followed by a record-breaking COVID outbreak as the disease ran rampant through Chinese cities, with some officials estimating daily case counts in the tens of millions.Now, the economic damage of that COVID chaos is coming through in earnings reports, whether due to disrupted production from locked-down factories, or lowered sales as consumers stayed home to recover or protect themselves. Yet companies are hopeful that China's reopening means the worst is over for their revenues.China’s COVID outbreak may be receding, though health officials are still waiting to see whether cases may surge again following the Lunar New Year holiday. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday that the number of severe COVID cases among hospitalized patients is down 89% from its peak in early January.Official Chinese data put the total COVID death toll at just over 84,000, but that is likely to be an undercount. A model from U.K.-based research firm Airfinity estimates the total COVID death toll since Dec. 1 at 1.19 million.AppleOn Thursday, Apple reported its first decline in quarterly revenue since 2019. The U.S.-based tech giant reported quarterly revenue of $117.2 billion for the most recent quarter, a year-on-year decline of 5%.On an earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook blamed COVID for its slumping sales, which came in below analyst expectations. Cook said “COVID-19-related challenges” disrupted the supply of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max through most of December, leading to extended ship times.Last November, Foxconn, a major Apple supplier, imposed mobility controls in its iPhone factory in Zhengzhou to suppress a budding outbreak. The factory’s workers, who could number as high as 300,000, were barred from leaving the site and eating in common areas. Many workers fled back to their hometowns, while those who remained were frustrated by COVID measures and feared getting infected. At the time, Apple warned that factory disruptions could affect holiday shipments of the latest iPhone models.Story continuesToday, Apple thinks these disruptions are over. “Production is now back where we want it to be,” Cook said on Thursday.The company also said that Beijing’s COVID controls hurt sales in China, one of the company's most important consumer markets. Yet the company is optimistic that demand will recover due to the country's reopening. Cook told analysts that Apple stores reported an increase in traffic in early December, after China lifted its COVID controls. “That followed through to demand as well,” Cook told analysts.Apple shares are down 3.7% in after-market trading.StarbucksStarbucks reported $8.7 billion in quarterly revenue on Thursday, a record for the coffee company and an 8% year-on-year increase. But the company’s results were dragged down by crashing demand in China, Starbucks’ second-largest market.The coffee company reported a 5% increase in global store sales overall. But sales in China fell by 29% as consumers stayed home. The decline was even more steep in December—the start of China’s record COVID surge—with sales falling by 42% compared to December 2021.China’s decline was so large that it offset strong growth elsewhere in the world. On the company's earnings call, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz noted that the company saw strong sales growth in all of its international market “except for China,” and that the company would have reported double-digit growth in international sales if China were excluded.Yet the coffee company also believes the worst is behind it. The country’s reopening “positions the country to resume pre-COVID levels of consumer, social and economic growth,” said Schultz. “Huge consumer demand in China is waiting to be unleashed,” he said.Starbucks shares are down 1.8% in after-market trading.Estée LauderThe Estée Lauder Companies reported $4.62 billion in sales for the most recent quarter, a year-on-year decline of 17%. The company blamed both COVID lockdowns and surging cases in China for dragging down its retail sales, particularly in the Chinese tourism hotspot of Hainan.The company said these COVID disruptions “led to prolonged store closures” and “caused the tightening of inventory by certain retailers who had previously placed orders in anticipation of the return of travel that was since delayed.”Yet the cosmetics company is hopeful that the return of Chinese travelers will support the company’s recovery. “Where there is obviously high traffic, our brands respond enormously,” Fabrizio Freda, the company’s CEO, said on the company's earnings call.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

Revenue fell 5% to $117.2 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $121.88B, representing the biggest quarterly revenue drop since 2016. This was due to weaker iPhone sales, which were down 8% to $65.78B amid a difficult macroeconomic environment and production issues in China.Following the results, Citi reiterated its Buy rating and noted, “Bears will be quick to point out negative sales growth but we note when adjusting for FX that sales and outlook are flat, which is materially better than other consumer electronic companies.” The firm highlighted that services are also outperforming and the company’s installed base continues to grow, with over 2 billion active Apple devices and iPhone installed base estimated at 1.2+ billion.Similarly, Evercore maintained its Outperform rating, while JPMorgan lowered its price target on the stock to $175.00 from $180.00, maintaining an Overweight rating.Alphabet shares plunge on Q4 missAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares dropped more than 4% premarket today after the company reported its Q4 results, with EPS of $1.05 coming in worse than the consensus of $1.18.

However, Google Cloud revenue saw an increase, rising to $7.32B from $5.54B in the prior-year period.Story continuesFollowing the report, Wolfe said it continues to believe the company's long-term competitive moats in the digital advertising space are solid and reiterated its Outperform rating with a revised price target of $120 (from $110).Several analysts also raised their price targets on the stock, including Morgan Stanley with its new price target of $135.00 (from $125.00), Evercore ISI with a new price target of $125.00 (from $120.00), and Roth Capital with a new price target of $126.00 (from $120.00).Amazon down 5% on Q4 EPS miss &amp; muted outlookAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares were trading more than 5% lower premarket today after the company reported its Q4 results, with EPS of $0.03 coming in worse than the consensus estimate of $0.17.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Archer-Daniels-Midland's shares before the 8th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.45 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.80 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Archer-Daniels-Midland has a trailing yield of 2.2% on the current share price of $82.31. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Archer-Daniels-Midland can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Archer-Daniels-Midland paid out just 21% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 42% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Archer-Daniels-Midland has grown its earnings rapidly, up 23% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Archer-Daniels-Midland has delivered an average of 9.9% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Archer-Daniels-Midland? We love that Archer-Daniels-Midland is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Archer-Daniels-Midland, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while Archer-Daniels-Midland has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Story continuesPeak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five momentum stocks.

TECK and United Rentals URI.5 PEG-Based Value Stocks to Pick for Your Portfolio NowIn a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register a 20.1% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2021. This favorably compares with a 10.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period.Several other stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here we discuss five such stocks — Archer Daniels Midland, Conagra Brands, Albertsons Companies, Teck Resources Ltd. and United Rentals.More on Value InvestingWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider the price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales (P/S) or price/book value (P/B).This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.Story continuesThe PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate.A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are five out of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Archer Daniels: Illinois-based Archer Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products. The company processes oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa and other feedstuffs. Moreover, it engages in the manufacturing, sale and distribution of products like natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products as well as other specialty food and feed ingredients.Archer Daniels has a long-term historical growth rate of 23.5%. AN currently carries a Zacks Rank of 1 and has a Value Score of A.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend investing, and go directly to read 5 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right Now. On February 1, 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, which marked its eighth increase since March 2022. The continuous interest rate hikes have made investors anxious about the stock market’s future. According to Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in January, investors broadly gave a pessimistic view of the market. However, over half of the respondents showed an inclination toward cheaper value stocks, considering their outperformance over growth equities in 2022. In addition to this, companies that have proven track records of dividend growth also made it to investors’ choice.Value stocks showed their greatest performance last year against growth equities since 2000, as reported by Bloomberg. Analysts expect the trend of value investing to continue this year as higher interest rates put margin pressures on the technology sector. Moreover, last year’s selloff was the worst for tech stocks since 2008, so investors are moving toward defensive quality stocks to stay afloat during this period. In this regard, dividend stocks regained their appeal, with dividend payments reaching their record high in 2022. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, compared with $511.2 billion in 2021. The report also mentioned that 373 companies in the S&amp;P 500 raised their dividend through December 15, up from 353 in 2021. These results show that companies have the sufficient cash flow to fulfill their shareholder obligation smoothly.AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) are some of the popular dividend companies that are gaining popularity among investors. These companies not only have raised their dividends for years but also have strong cash generation that promises further growth in the future. Given this, we will discuss the cheapest dividend aristocrats in this article.Story continues15 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right NowPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below belong to the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats, the companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more.

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits.

ADM, Agilent Technologies A, Republic Services Inc. RSG, Deere &amp; Co. DE and Cardinal Health Inc. CAH.5 Top Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy in the Month of LoveDividend investing has remained the hottest segment of the stock market over the past year. Though U.S. stocks have resumed their strength this year on easing inflation and the Fed’s slower rate hike bets, recession worries persist. In such a scenario, dividends are major sources of consistent income for investors though they do not offer dramatic price appreciation. Stocks backed by regular dividends can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and tend to outperform in a choppy market.In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns. Honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Agilent Technologies, Republic Services Inc., Deere &amp; Co. and Cardinal Health Inc. — that investors would love to buy this month.Why is Dividend Growth Better?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Story continuesAlthough these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Here are five of the 21 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

114,82396154-f9f1-3538-96db-176c0310025c,ADM,2023-02-03,5 Momentum Stocks for February After a Strong January,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-momentum-stocks-february-strong-131601563.html,1675343761,STORY,['ADM'],"[Wall Street ended the first month of 2023 with a solid rally after a highly disappointing 2022. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — appreciated 2.8%, 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 closed their third positive month in four. The S&amp;P 500 posted the best January since 2019. The Nasdaq Composite ended the best month since July and the best January since 2001.Favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic data and a resilient labor market raised market participants’ hope for a soft landing of the U.S. economy. At this stage, it should be profitable to invest in momentum stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Five such stocks are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Nucor Corp. NUE, Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD, United Rentals Inc. URI and Ameriprise Financial Inc. AMP.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.Story continuesOn Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five momentum stocks. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions over the last seven days, which indicates that the market is expecting these companies to do solid business in 2023. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Momentum Score of A.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher-Daniels-Midland.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.7% over the last seven days.Nucor is committed to expanding its production capabilities and growing its business through strategic acquisitions.

NUE is also seeing strong momentum in the non-residential construction market and strong demand in the heavy equipment market.Nucor remains focused on achieving greater penetration of the automotive market because of the segment’s long-term growth opportunities. Higher steel prices due to tight supply and higher end-market demand should also drive NUE’s margins.

The acquisitions of Heartland and United Steel Supply have boosted Steel Dynamics' shipping capabilities.

URI has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals.

115,e1e78b50-eeb5-3cc8-9a80-23301060523e,ADM,2023-02-03,5 PEG-Based Value Stocks to Pick for Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-peg-based-value-stocks-124912465.html,1675342152,STORY,['ADM'],"[In a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register a 20.1% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2021. This favorably compares with a 10.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period.Several other stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here we discuss five such stocks — Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Conagra Brands CAG, Albertsons Companies ACI, Teck Resources Ltd TECK and United Rentals URI.More on Value InvestingWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider the price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales (P/S) or price/book value (P/B).This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate.A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.Story continuesWhile P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purposes)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20-Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.Here are five out of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Archer Daniels: Illinois-based Archer Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products. The company processes oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa and other feedstuffs. Moreover, it engages in the manufacturing, sale and distribution of products like natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products as well as other specialty food and feed ingredients.Archer Daniels has a long-term historical growth rate of 23.5%.

This compares to earnings of $1.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 13.48%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chocolate bar and candy maker would post earnings of $2.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.17, delivering a surprise of 4.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Hershey , which belongs to the Zacks Food - Confectionery industry, posted revenues of $2.65 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.82%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.33 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Hershey shares have lost about 2.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Hershey?While Hershey has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Hershey: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

(LUV): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-southwest-airlines-140002374.html,1675346402,STORY,['LUV'],"[Southwest Airlines (LUV) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this airline have returned +6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which Southwest falls in, has gained 17.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Southwest is expected to post earnings of $0.03 per share, indicating a change of +109.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -90% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.81 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +142.2%. This estimate has changed -13.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.98 indicates a change of +41.8% from what Southwest is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Southwest.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LUV _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Southwest, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.77 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +22.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.19 billion and $29.04 billion estimates indicate +14.2% and +6.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySouthwest reported revenues of $6.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.2%. EPS of -$0.38 for the same period compares with $0.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.11%. The EPS surprise was -1166.67%.Over the last four quarters, Southwest surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Southwest is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Southwest. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes.

125,97ed7ff5-6f91-3bbd-bb11-bb8b37936909,PM,2023-02-03,Analysts Estimate Philip Morris (PM) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-philip-morris-pm-150103855.html,1675350063,STORY,['PM'],"[The market expects Philip Morris (PM) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.4%.Revenues are expected to be $7.44 billion, down 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.37% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris?For Philip Morris, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.11%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Philip Morris will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of $1.38 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of +10.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Philip Morris doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition, the company has promoted Jessica Kattman to Vice President, Global Marketing and Communications. Aderant continues to make bold strides forward to expand its team and talent base.These moves come on the heels of two years of tremendous global growth for the organization. With the acquisitions of American LegalNet (ALN) and viGlobal, it was important for President and CEO Chris Cartrett to continue to fill out a strong, innovative leadership team with tenured experts. Advancing the knowledge and skill in its product and technology teams was imperative to continued success.""The growth we have experienced in recent years is a testament to the strength of our team. Going forward though, we have much larger plans. Adding Doug and Andy to the leadership team was crucial for us to be able to deliver on our long-term company vision,"" said Cartrett. ""I am excited to work with these extremely talented individuals and welcome their desire to push the envelope to further grow our business and enhance the delivery of quality solutions that help our clients run a better business.""Matthews brings 20+ years of product leadership tenure to the position, including building world class product management teams and designing and executing successful cloud and business transformation strategies. Prior to joining Aderant, he was General Manager and Senior Vice President of the Data Protection Business at Veritas Technologies, LLC where he prioritized the delivery of crucial business capabilities with a customer-first approach, built on solving their most critical unmet needs. Matthews is well-suited to grow the Aderant product suite both internally through development as well as through acquisitions and partnerships with third-party organizations.Story continuesHoyt’s forward-thinking and hands-on leadership style made him the perfect choice for Aderant’s next CTO. He will oversee the company’s global development team and collaboratively develop the future technical vision and roadmap for the entire Aderant product suite. Hoyt joins Aderant from NCR Corporation, where he implemented an ""API-First Strategy"", prioritizing client interests. He also led the company’s initiative to migrate clients from their legacy platforms to cloud-native applications. His 17-year tenure at IBM where he guided clients through their digital transformations with new technologies and process makes him the ideal candidate to lead Aderant’s continued transition to the cloud space.With Matthews and Hoyt leading the charge on the product and technology side, Aderant is poised to see even more growth and expansion. This fast-paced move to the cloud puts clients in the driver’s seat of their own technological destiny, which is where Kattman will play a vital role. Kattman has been instrumental in Aderant’s growth over the past two years. Educating the market and bringing awareness to Aderant’s breadth of products that support all facets of a law firm’s business, regardless of the PMS they run, will be the driver for future growth. Creating a unique and engaging customer experience falls under her purview via events, client communications and overall brand synergy.""Jess has been a tremendous leader in our organization. Her creativeness and attention to detail have shaped who Aderant is today. Promoting her to Vice President and moving her onto our executive team simply gives her a larger platform and voice to continue our evolution into the company and provider we desire to be,"" said Cartrett.These moves complete Aderant’s executive leadership group. This journey began in late 2021 after Cartrett moved into the President role. A focus on leadership and talent was his top initiative, leading to the appointment of Shira Aharoni as Aderant’s first Chief People Officer. Aderant has heavily invested in its strategy of attracting, developing, and growing talent within its organization. The addition of Aharoni in 2022 has brought significant change in how the company manages and supports its people. Aharoni’s history in HR leadership within software companies like NCR Corporation and Finastra LTD, gives her the expertise and passion required to shape and strengthen the Aderant team. Aharoni has been instrumental in helping lead the overall workforce strategy in conjunction with COO Raphael Shure.""Our people can’t give 100% to our clients if they aren’t getting 110% from us,"" said Aharoni.

The company’s quarterly results are likely to exhibit year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 1.37% in terms of FFO per share. The quarterly results reflected healthy operating performance and growth in occupancy levels. The retail REIT behemoth also raised the 2022 FFO per share outlook based on the quarterly results.In the last four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average surprise being 3.05%. This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSimon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSimon Property Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPer a report from CBRE Group CBRE, retail real estate markets remained robust in the fourth quarter, with resilient demand driving the retail availability rate to 4.9% after hitting a high of 6.6% in fourth-quarter 2020.The core retail sales, excluding motor vehicles, gasoline and auto parts, climbed 7.1% from the prior-year period. The non-store retail sales, which include e-commerce, grew 11.3% year over year.The retail asking rent improved 2.5% year over year for the second consecutive quarter to $22.78 per square foot in the fourth quarter. This was primarily driven by strong demand and limited new supply.Retail space absorption came in at 12.7 million square feet for fourth-quarter 2022, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of positive retail absorption per the CBRE Group report.Simon Property, too, is anticipated to have benefited from the above-mentioned factors.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has been benefiting retail REITs as retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand. This is likely to have driven demand for SPG’s properties, aiding its fourth-quarter cashflows.Simon Property’s adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers are likely to have paid off well. In November, SPG announced that Leap, the retail platform for modern brands, would open numerous stores at its properties. The move is expected to help many digitally native brands to strategically expand as omnichannel retailers.Further, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, is anticipated to have enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play. In November, Nobu Hospitality and Simon Property celebrated the opening of Nobu Hotel &amp; Restaurant Atlanta at the mixed-use development — Phipps Plaza — in Buckhead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter lease income is pegged at $1.26 billion, up from $1.23 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for management fees and other revenues is $28.79 million, up 2.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. In addition, the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is presently pegged at $1.37 billion, indicating an increase of 3.1% year over year.On the acquisition front, in December 2022, Simon Property closed its earlier announced strategic partnership with Jamestown, wherein the former acquired a 50% interest in the latter from its founding partners. Through the partnership, SPG will be able to drive its future densification projects with the help of Jamestown’s platform, making the buyout a strategic fit.However, increasing interest expenses might have been a deterrent for Simon Property during the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been unchanged over the past month at $3.14. Nonetheless, the figure indicates a rise of 1.6% year over year.For 2022, Simon Property projected FFO per share in the range of $11.83-$11.88.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been unchanged at $11.68 over the past month. The figure indicates a fall of 2.2% year over year on revenues of $5.24 billion.Story continuesEarning WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for SPG this season.

Not saying they won't happen, but haven't seen material changes at this point,"" Aptiv finance chief Joseph Massaro said during an analyst call.Tesla slashed prices globally on its electric vehicles by as much as 20% earlier this year to stoke demand, triggering a price war.Soon rival Ford Motor Co followed with its own price cut and boosted production of its electric crossover SUV Mustang Mach-E.Production levels are being closely watched at automakers as they try and ramp output at a time analysts have raised the prospect of a demand destruction due to a worsening economic environment.Aptiv, which makes advanced driver assistance systems, vehicle computers and high-voltage cabling, said it expects global light vehicle production to fall 1% this year as a chip crunch continues to weigh.The company also forecast a lower-than-expected 2023 adjusted profit in part due to inflationary pressures though price hikes shielded its fourth-quarter results.Aptiv Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark said macroeconomic uncertainty, supply disruptions and inflationary cost impacts are likely to persist in 2023.The company expects full-year adjusted profit per share between $4.00 and $4.50, compared with analysts' expectation of $4.73 per share, as per Refinitiv data.It reported an adjusted profit of $1.27 per share for the quarter through December, compared with analysts estimates of $1.22 per share.The company reported revenue for the fourth quarter of $4.64 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $4.45 billion.The company's shares were up 3% in morning trade.

(NYSE:AIG) has fallen by 6.8% over the past week , insiders who sold US$1.4m worth of stock over the past year have had less luck. Given that the average selling price of US$56.45 is still lower than the current share price, insiders would probably have been better off keeping their shares.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for American International Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American International GroupThe Executive VP, Luciana Fato, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$918k worth of shares at a price of US$54.01 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$59.03). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 28% of Luciana Fato's holding.In the last year American International Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that American International Group insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$73m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About American International Group Insiders?The fact that there have been no American International Group insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Our analysis of American International Group insider transactions leaves us cautious. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. American International Group (AIG) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.26 a share 13 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 15, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.26 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.19 Zacks Consensus Estimate, American International Group has an Earnings ESP of 5.73%.AIG is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Mid-America Apartment Communities is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 26, 2023. MAA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.32 a share 83 days from its next earnings release.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mid-America Apartment Communities is $2.25, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.24%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, AIG and MAA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The bottom line improved 4% year over year.GAAP loss per share in the quarter was 50 cents against the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 17 cents per share. The significant decline in the second quarter was due to a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment of $709 million related to the Medical segment.Revenue DetailsRevenues improved 13% on a year-over-year basis to $51.5 billion. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.1%.Segmental AnalysisPharmaceutical SegmentIn the fiscal second-quarter, pharmaceutical revenues amounted to $47.7 billion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis. The performance highlights branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and new Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers.Pharmaceutical profit was $464 million, up 9% on a year-over-year basis.

However, the loss per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share.We had projected the loss per share to be 2 cents, which matched the company-reported result.Revenues in DetailAccuray registered revenues of $114.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, down 1.3% year over year. The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.9%.The fiscal second-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $108.5 million.The overall top-line growth was mainly dampened by supply-chain constraints and foreign exchange headwinds.At constant exchange rate (CER), net revenues were $120.9 million, representing a 4% increase from the prior-year period.Segmental DetailsAccuray derives revenues from two sources — Products and Services.In the fiscal second quarter, Product revenues improved 4.2% from the year-ago quarter to $63.3 million. This figure compares to our Product revenues’ fiscal second-quarter projection of $55.9 million.At CER, Product revenues improved 8%.Services revenues fell 7.3% from the year-ago quarter to $51.5 million. This figure compares to our Services revenues’ fiscal second-quarter projection of $52.6 million.At CER, Services revenues were flat.Gross product orders totaled $79 million, down 7.4% year over year.

Gross margin expanded 78 basis points (bps) to 37.4%.We had projected 36.3% of gross margin for the fiscal second quarter.Story continuesSelling and marketing expenses rose 2.7% to $13.6 million. Research and development expenses fell 0.4% year over year to $14.6 million, while general and administrative expenses went up 12.3% year over year to $12 million. Total operating expenses of $40.3 million increased 4.2% year over year.Operating profit totaled $2.7 million in the fiscal second quarter, which declined 32.1% from the prior-year quarter. Operating margin in the fiscal second quarter contracted 107 bps to 2.4%.Financial PositionAccuray exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $67.7 million compared with $81 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter.Total debt (including short-term debt) at the end of the fiscal second quarter was $179.8 million compared with $176.3 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter.FY23 GuidanceAccuray has reiterated its outlook for fiscal 2023 based on current expectations.The company continues to expect its fiscal year revenues to be $447 million-$455 million, reflecting year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range of 5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $448.7 million.Our TakeAccuray ended the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. Robust Product revenues and geographical performances are impressive. Continued strong demand for Accuray’s ClearRT Helical kVCT Imaging for the Radixact System, Synchrony Technology and VOLO Ultra enhancement looks promising. During the reported quarter, the company received 34 new system orders globally, with notable strength in the America's region with solid year-over-year growth. In China, Accuray made impressive progress with respect to its CyberKnife and Radixact Systems, which also buoy our optimism.During the fiscal second quarter, Accuray advanced key strategic partnerships, including with C-RAD, introducing the VitalHold breast package. This is expected to allow Accuray to offer the most comprehensive breast package in the market. This also looks encouraging for the stock. Gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock.However, dismal overall top-line and bottom-line performances and lower Services revenues are disappointing. The decline in gross orders is also worrying. The operating margin contraction also does not bode well. The current global supply-chain shortages, forex woes and inflationary pressure are other challenges the company is navigating through, which is another concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAccuray currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%.The fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $4.51 billion.At constant exchange rate (CER), revenues climbed 1.7%.The top-line improvement primarily resulted from strength in BD Medical and BD Interventional segments. However, the overall top-line improvement was partially offset by a fall in worldwide COVID-19-only diagnostic testing revenues.Base revenues were $4.55 billion in the fiscal first quarter, up 0.4% year over year on a reported basis and 5.2% at CER.Base organic revenue growth for the fiscal first quarter was down 1.7% on a reported basis but up 3% at CER.Segment DetailsBD’s operations consist of three worldwide business segments — BD Medical, BD Life Sciences and BD Interventional.For the quarter under review, BD Medical reported worldwide revenues of $2.15 billion, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and 6.1% at CER. Per management, this upside can be attributed to strong performances by the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems business units.This compares to our projection of fiscal first-quarter segmental revenues of $2.11 billion.Worldwide revenues in the BD Life Sciences segment totaled $1.30 billion, down 12.2% year over year on a reported basis and down 7.3% at CER. The decline resulted primarily from the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions (IDS) unit’s fall in COVID-only diagnostic testing revenues. However, this was partially offset by the IDS unit’s strong growth in the base business (driven by strong demand for BD’s respiratory testing portfolio, which was partly aided by timing of dealer orders, strong BD Kiestra lab automation installations and leveraging its higher BD MAX installed base for molecular In Vitro Diagnostic assay growth) and strength in the Biosciences unit.Story continuesThe fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $1.33 billion.BD Interventional segment generated worldwide revenues of $1.13 billion, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and 5.6% at CER. This was owing to strength in the Peripheral Intervention business unit.The fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $1.07 billion.Geographic ResultsIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, revenues in the United States improved 0.9% to $2.73 billion.The fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $2.56 billion.International revenues grossed $1.86 billion, down 7.9% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis but up 2.7% at CER.The fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $1.95 million.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Becton, Dickinson and Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBecton, Dickinson and Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Becton, Dickinson and Company Quote Margin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, BD’s gross profit fell 3.9% to $2.13 billion. Gross margin contracted 54 basis points (bps) to 46.5%.We had projected 44.9% of gross margin for the fiscal first quarter.Selling and administrative expenses rose 0.2% to $1.19 billion. Research and development expenses declined 0.3% year over year to $313 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $1.50 billion increased 0.1% year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $633 million, reflecting a 12.2% decline from the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating margin in the fiscal first quarter contracted 148 bps to 13.8%.Financial PositionBD exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $612 million compared with $1.01 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. Total debt (including current debt obligations) at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023 was $16.46 billion compared with $16.07 billion at the end of fiscal 2022.Net cash flow from continuing operating activities at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023 was $399 million compared with $530 million a year ago.Meanwhile, BD has a consistent dividend-paying history, with its five-year annualized dividend growth being 3.97%.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceBD has revised its financial outlook for fiscal 2023.BD now projects its full fiscal year revenues to be in the range of $19.1 billion-$19.3 billion, up from the earlier-provided projections of $18.6 billion-$18.8 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $18.88 billion.The revenue projections for fiscal 2023 now include base-business revenue growth at CER of 5.75-6.75%, up from the earlier expectations of an uptick of 5.25-6.25%.The outlook now estimates around $50 million-$100 million in COVID-19-only diagnostic testing revenues, down from the earlier projections of $125 million-$175 million.For the full fiscal year, adjusted EPS is now anticipated to be $12.07-$12.32, up from the earlier estimates of $11.85-$12.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $11.94.Our TakeBD exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. An improvement in the overall base revenues and robust performances by the majority of its segments and in the United States are impressive. Strength in BD’s segment’s business units during the reported quarter was also promising.BD’s recent agreement with Biocorp and a co-exclusive commercial agreement with Magnolia Medical Technologies, Inc. look promising. BD’s recent launch of a new, robotic track system for the BD Kiestra microbiology laboratory solution — 3rd Generation BD Kiestra Total Lab Automation System — is encouraging. BD and CerTest Biotec’s receipt of the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization for VIASURE Monkeypox Virus Real Time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) Reagents for BD MAX System, which is now available for BD MAX System users, also raises our optimism.However, the year-over-year decline in reported revenues is disappointing. The fall in BD Life Sciences and international revenues is worrying. Lower COVID-only testing revenues in the quarter and BD’s expectations of its continued fall during fiscal 2023 are discouraging from a business perspective. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Key PicksBD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The top line increased 5.4% year over year, reflecting strong growth in the United States, partially offset by lower international sales due to divestitures of its European businesses.Q3 Segmental AnalysisFollowing McKesson’s segment realignment in the quarter under review, the reporting segments are as follows:Revenues at the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment were $61.9 billion, up 13% year over year. Per management, the upside was primarily driven by market growth and a higher volume of specialty products, including an increase in volumes from retail national account customers. However, branded-to-generic conversions partially offset the upside.The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment reported an adjusted operating profit of $778 million, up 6% from the prior-year quarter. This was due to growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, partially mitigated by lower demand for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The adjusted metric for the segment was up 7%, excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution.At the International segment, revenues amounted to $4.4 billion, down 53% year over year, due to divestitures of McKesson’s European businesses.McKesson Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McKesson Corporation QuoteAdjusted operating profit at the segment was $143 million, down 36% from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesRevenues at the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment totaled $3 billion, down 3% year over year due to lower COVID-1-related sales, partially offset by growth in the primary care business.The Medical-Surgical segment delivered an adjusted operating profit of $336 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the adjusted metric was up 25%.Revenues at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment totaled $1.1 billion, up 9% year over year. The improvement can be attributed to an increase in prescription from third-party logistics as well as higher technology services revenues.Adjusted operating profit was $155 million at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, up 7% from the prior-year quarter.MarginsGross profit in the reported quarter was $3.17 billion, down 7.4% on a year-over-year basis.

The company raised the guidance following solid fiscal third-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $24.78.The earnings outlook includes 70 cents to 80 cents associated with the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution and another $1.10 to $1.20 associated with the U.S. government’s kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies program and COVID-19 tests. It also includes a negative impact of 15 cents related to year-to-date net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments.Summing UpMcKesson exited the fiscal third-quarter on a strong note, beating estimates for revenues and earnings. The strong fiscal third-quarter show across all its four segments is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instills optimism.However, price fluctuation of generic pharmaceuticals and stiff competition in the MedTech space are other headwinds.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMcKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, Cardinal Health CAH and Hologic, Inc.

However, both the metrics exceeded the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Device verification will be triggered when someone accesses your account on a new device that isn’t associated with the household, CNBC Make It reported, or if the account is repeatedly used outside the home. Netflix will send an email to the primary account holder with a four-digit verification code. This code must be entered within 15 minutes before it expires.IP addresses, device IDs and account activity will be used to determine which devices are part of the same household, Netflix stated.CNBC Make It noted that Netflix “will not automatically charge you if you share your account.” However, it still remains unclear how users will be billed for password sharing. In the past, the company has said more than 100 million households share a password, and the practice has cost the company about $9 billion worldwide.Recently, Netflix mistakenly released its guidelines on password sharing in Chile, Peru and Costa Rica on its help center pages, but it has since been taken down, The Guardian reported. Netflix has been testing “paid sharing” in these three countries since last year, allowing account holders to pay for an extra person outside of the household to access their account. Netflix charged up to $2.99 per month for this service.“As we roll out paid sharing, members in many countries will also have the option to pay extra if they want to share Netflix with people they don’t live with,” the company said. The company has also stated that restrictions on account sharing would be “a change for members who share their account more broadly.”Story continuesMore From GOBankingRates5 Best Southern Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a MonthExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 2023How To Save Money When Filing TaxesThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Netflix Password Sharing Update — Will There Be Financial Penalties?]"

Netflix sent that out nearly six years ago, and now it seems the company has had a change of heart. The question for Netflix now is, do you love the streaming giant enough to pay for your own account? Netflix has begun enforcing its no password sharing policy by officially updating its help center for countries currently in the crackdown zone. That's Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru. But the US may be up next. So pay attention to these changes.Sharing your Netflix account with someone outside your household will get you on the naughty list. Users will be asked to identify the primary location for the account. And you'll need to sign in to your primary location at least once every 31 days to keep that setting up to date. Now, here's where it gets stickier. If someone logs into your account from a device not affiliated with that primary location, their device may be blocked. If you're traveling and you log on to your Netflix account, you can request a temporary code and watch Netflix for seven consecutive days. If your trip is longer than 31 days, you'll need to update your primary location.Getting heated yet? I am. Netflix will be using IP addresses, device IDs, and account activity to determine if a device is connected to your primary location. The policy is indeed good news for Netflix and its investors as the company is said to lose around $6 billion a year on customers who share passwords. The added revenue only strengthens its case as the clear streaming leader.- I think Netflix is the Kleenex of streaming, bottom line, period. Best run, cash flow. Now they're going into advertising. Fantastic. They will be the core.DAVE BRIGGS: I don't disagree with that. But how this policy is received in the short-term will fall somewhere between Southwest Airlines holiday meltdown and the Taylor Swift Ticketmaster debacle. Yes, the vast majority will shake it off. But brace yourselves for-- pardon the second Swifty reference-- bad blood. Parents with kids in college, pay. Kids at boarding school, pay. Kids studying abroad, pay, pay, pay. Couples who have long distance relationships, you pay one that, at its surface, as simple as a red light, green light game.Story continuesOnce you dig below the surface and see how this will become a constant annoyance for many of Netflix's 220 million subscribers, you can see this is actually more of a ""Squid Game"" red light, green light, because there will be casualties, much like in that show. I will be one of them. I guarantee it because I think the constant annoyance, Seana, of logging on, logging off, getting locked out of your account when your kids might be gone, my wife travels without me with her-- with the kids sometimes. They're going to get logged out. I love ""Wednesday,"" but once I'm through with it, and this annoyance starts, adios. Your thoughts?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I totally agree. I think they are going to lose a number of subscribers right now because of the crackdown. But they simply don't care. They see it being a bumpy ride at least in the near term. But long-term, they actually see an improvement in engagement. When you take a look at a number of the analyst notes that have been out there, Cowen saying that they think it could add about $1.6 billion in global revenue once they have a widespread crackdown on password sharing. 100 million households they estimate share passwords.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm not going to disagree--SEANA SMITH: I would be in that.DAVE BRIGGS: --Cowen. I'm just saying, if you don't have sticky content--SEANA SMITH: Oh, yeah, people are leaving.DAVE BRIGGS: --then it will hurt. Wednesday's fantastic, and some of the hits they've produced are certainly. But you better continue a steady stream of sticky shows, or people will not return.SEANA SMITH: And you need to, just given the sheer competition out there. And people have so many other choices at this point.]"

The company’s average revenues per membership declined as it continues to face stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon prime video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and TikTok.However, Netflix added 7.66 million paid subscribers globally in fourth-quarter 2022, higher than its estimate of gaining 4.5 million users.

Canadian National is also active on the share buyback front.Strong cash flow generating-ability supports Canadian National's shareholder-friendly activities.

""This approval reinforces our continued efforts to improve accessibility to TEZSPIRE, a first-in-class medicine proven to consistently and significantly reduce exacerbations across a broad population of people with severe asthma.""The approval by the FDA was based on results from the PATHFINDER clinical trial program, which included results from the PATH-BRIDGE Phase 1 trial and the PATH-HOME trial Phase 3 trial.10 The majority (92%) of healthcare providers, patients and caregivers were able to successfully administer TEZSPIRE both in the clinic and at home throughout the PATH-HOME trial. The improvements in asthma control and the safety profile of TEZSPIRE observed in the PATH-HOME trial were consistent with previous clinical trials.10""Severe asthma continues to be a very complex condition to manage, so we welcome the TEZSPIRE pre-filled pen as an option that will empower patients and healthcare providers with increased choice,"" said Kenneth Mendez, president and chief executive officer of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. ""We believe self-administration alternatives can play an important role in patients' lives and address unmet needs for those living with severe asthma.""Story continuesThe most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3% and more common than placebo) of TEZSPIRE are pharyngitis, arthralgia, and back pain.1TEZSPIRE self-administration and the TEZSPIRE pre-filled pen are also approved in the European Union (EU) and are under regulatory review in several other countries around the world. TEZSPIRE is currently approved for the treatment of severe asthma in the U.S., EU, Japan and other countries.TEZSPIRE® (tezepelumab-ekko) U.S. IndicationTEZSPIRE is indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma.TEZSPIRE is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.TEZSPIRE® (tezepelumab-ekko) Important Safety Information CONTRAINDICATIONSKnown hypersensitivity to tezepelumab-ekko or excipients.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSHypersensitivity ReactionsHypersensitivity reactions were observed in the clinical trials (e.g., rash and allergic conjunctivitis) following the administration of TEZSPIRE. Postmarketing cases of anaphylaxis have been reported. These reactions can occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (i.e., days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to continue or discontinue treatment with TEZSPIRE.Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating DiseaseTEZSPIRE should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, acute bronchospasm, or status asthmaticus.Abrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid DosageDo not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with TEZSPIRE. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.Parasitic (Helminth) InfectionIt is unknown if TEZSPIRE will influence a patient's response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with TEZSPIRE. If patients become infected while receiving TEZSPIRE and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue TEZSPIRE until infection resolves.Live Attenuated VaccinesThe concomitant use of TEZSPIRE and live attenuated vaccines has not been evaluated. The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving TEZSPIRE.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3%) are pharyngitis, arthralgia, and back pain.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSThere are no available data on TEZSPIRE use in pregnant women to evaluate for any drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Placental transfer of monoclonal antibodies such as Tezepelumab-ekko is greater during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy.Please see the full Prescribing Information including Patient Information and Instructions for Use.You may report side effects related to AstraZeneca products by clicking here.About TEZSPIRE® (tezepelumab-ekko)TEZSPIRE is a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that works on the primary source of inflammation: the airway epithelium, which is the first point of contact for viruses, allergens, pollutants and other environmental insults. Specifically, TEZSPIRE targets and blocks TSLP, a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and initiates an overreactive immune response to allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma.11,12 TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles.11,12Expression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity.11,13 Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control.11,13 By working at the top of the cascade, TEZSPIRE helps stop inflammation at the source and has the potential to treat a broad population of severe asthma patients.11,13TEZSPIRE is also in development for other potential indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, chronic spontaneous urticaria and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). In October 2021, tezepelumab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of EoE.About Severe AsthmaGlobally, there are approximately 2.5 million patients with severe asthma who are uncontrolled or biologic eligible, with approximately 1.3 million in the U.S. Many patients with severe asthma have an inadequate response to currently available biologics and oral corticosteroids and thus fail to achieve asthma control.14-19 Uncontrolled asthma occurs when symptoms persist despite treatment. Severe, uncontrolled asthma is debilitating with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations, significant limitations on lung function and a reduced quality of life.15-17 Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma have twice the risk of asthma-related hospitalizations.20,21 There is also a significant socio-economic burden with these severe uncontrolled asthma patients accounting for 50% of asthma-related costs.22Multiple inflammatory pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma.22-24 Eosinophilic asthma, and more broadly, T2 inflammation-driven asthma, accounts for about two-thirds of patients with severe asthma.24 These patients are typically characterized as having elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers, including blood eosinophils, serum IgE and FeNO.25,26 However, many patients do not fit the criteria for eosinophilic or allergic asthma, may have unclear or multiple drivers of inflammation, and may not qualify for or respond well to a current biologic medicine.26About the Amgen and AstraZeneca CollaborationIn 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated the 2012 collaboration agreement for TEZSPIRE. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit royalty to Amgen. AstraZeneca continues to lead development and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Amgen's business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market.Amgen's results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen's products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen's research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen's business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen's business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for Amgen's manufacturing activities, the distribution of Amgen's products, the commercialization of Amgen's product candidates, and Amgen's clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on Amgen's product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen's products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen's distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen's products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen's efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen's systems and Amgen's data. Amgen's stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen's business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving its environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect Amgen's business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect Amgen's business. Amgen's business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks Michael Strapazon, 805-313-5553 (media) Jessica Akopyan, 805-440-5721 (media) Arvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors)ReferencesTEZSPIRE U.S. Prescribing Information.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Largest Petrochemical Companies in the World.Petrochemicals are an essential part of our daily lives because of their ability to transform oil and gas into a variety of everyday products like plastics, fertilizers, packaging, apparel, digital devices, medical equipment, detergents, and tires. They are used in many components of the contemporary energy system, including solar panels, wind turbine blades, batteries, thermal insulation for buildings, electric car components, and essential items for our daily lives. Petrochemicals are becoming ever more crucial to the global energy system, where they already play a significant role. Since the turn of the millennium, demand for plastics, the most well-known petrochemical goods, has exceeded that of all other bulk materials (such as steel, aluminum, or cement). However, the industry has been in the headlines recently as it contributes to global carbon emissions, and climate activists have been pushing for the industry to move towards more sustainable production.The global petrochemical market size is projected to be valued at $798.8 billion by 2030, increasing from $523.56 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 5.4%. The U.S. Energy Information Agency’s International Energy Outlook projects that fossil fuels will supply 60% of primary energy consumption globally in 2050. The United States is a leader in the low-cost production of petrochemicals. Petrochemicals industrial production in the country is expected to be worth $79.8 billion in 2022 and is largely concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina.Largest Petrochemical Companies tcly / shutterstock.comAccording to the Energy Information Administration, USA's operable crude refining capacity was 17.94 million b/d on January 1, 2022, down from 18.09 million b/d at the start of 2021 and a record high of 18.98 million b/d in 2020 before the pandemic took hold. The estimate for 2022 is the lowest since 14.92 million b/d in 2014. EIA also mentions that refinery capacity might be lower than this figure because of the capacity reductions announced later in 2022. S&amp;P Global suggests various reasons for these refinery closures, including storm damage, pandemic effects, high operating costs, failure to finalize sales, lower future demand predictions, or conversions to generate more renewable fuels.Story continuesMoreover, the United States has not built any new refining capacity in decades. The last major refinery in the US came into operation in 1977 in Louisiana. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth made headlines last year when he stated that the United States would never build another refinery. His reasoning was simple: the national policy has been to restrict demand for petrochemicals, making this sector unappealing to investors, given that it takes a decade to recover the initial cost of building a refinery. His views are not incorrect; governments all over the world have been helping the electric vehicle industry to reduce the demand for petrochemicals. According to IHS Markit research, US oil and liquids demand might fall by around 25% from 20.3 million barrels per day in 2019 to an anticipated 15.3 million b/d in 2050. According to IHS's low-carbon policy scenario, US oil demand for transportation might fall to 7 million b/d by 2050. Globally, Equinor ASA predicts that demand for oil for transportation will shrink 47% between 2018 and 2050 if current trends continue, thanks to advances in fuel efficiency and electric vehicles.In the near future, the petrochemical industries of the Middle East and China will be the center of attention, with the EIA estimating that they will lead refining capacity increases in 2022 and 2023. The Saudi government is also pushing for a stronger presence in the downstream petrochemical industry to reduce its reliance on crude oil. To achieve this goal, Saudi Arabia has signed several deals with China to collaborate on various projects in the downstream oil business. Although most analysts believe that demand for petrochemicals will fall in the long term as the global economy shifts to more renewable resources, both the demand and supply of petrochemicals will increase in the next few years. According to McKinsey, continued growth in crucial end markets that utilize petrochemicals, such as packaging and construction, as well as economic development in China, India, and Southeast Asia, will boost demand. Meanwhile, the consulting firm expects supply to grow at a robust rate. However, in the ethylene market category, which dominates the petrochemicals industry, McKinsey predicts capacity to rise faster than demand, lowering profit margins in this segment.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 20 largest petrochemical companies in the world, we identified the biggest petrochemicals companies in major economies and ranked these companies in ascending order in order of their market cap. For private companies, we used a revenue multiple of 1.5x, which we think is a fair valuation multiple for the private companies operating in the petrochemical Industry.20 Largest Petrochemical Companies in the World20.

Traders blend these barrels with other oils to rebrand the fuel oil's country of origin, clearing the way for ship insurance and financing that would otherwise be banned under the sanctions, trade sources said.Discounts offered on these fuel oil cargoes help to improve margins at Chinese independent refiners and replace crude that some companies are unable to import without quotas, the sources said. The trade also provides a way to get Russian oil to market and bring much-needed export earnings to Moscow.""We've been looking at Russian fuel oil since December. It is cheap and does not require (crude) import quotas,"" said an executive with an independent refiner in eastern Shandong province.The refiner has not received any government crude quotas for the past year or so and buys mostly straight-run fuel oil to produce diesel and gasoline, said the executive, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.These blended fuel oil barrels were last traded at about a $5 discount to benchmark crude ICE Brent on a delivered Shandong basis, said one source.High-sulphur fuel oil values relative to crude have plunged into deeper discounts since the second quarter last year, with cracks hitting record lows at end-October.China's total fuel oil imports surged to about 1.76 million tonnes in December, highest since September 2021, official customs data showed.Story continuesThe uptick was driven by a surge in shipments from Malaysia to more than a one-year high at 620,000 tonnes, while monthly imports from UAE rose to 471,000 tonnes, highest in two years.Meanwhile, direct imports of fuel oil from Russia slipped to 187,000 tonnes in December after peaking at 554,000 tonnes in October, even as total imports from Russia more than doubled year-on-year to 3.1 million tonnes in 2022.China’s fuel oil imports from Malaysia and the UAE surge in Q4 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lgpdknwqavo/China's%20fuel%20oil%20imports.png""The deep discounts offered are driving the trend as independent refiners are price sensitive. China is still recovering, with domestic demand for refined fuels uncertain,"" said Emril Jamil, Refinitiv's senior analyst for crude and fuel oil.""The trend will continue with the EU ban (on Feb. 5), with all natural outlets in Europe closed. Asia will continue to soak up cheaper Russian (fuel oil) barrels on top of crude,"" Jamil said.TRADING COMPANIESWestern trading houses have been the main suppliers of these fuel oil shipments to China, said four senior trading sources, who closely track the flows, adding that the elevated December levels will extend through February and beyond.One of the top suppliers channelling these barrels to China is Swiss-based trader Vitol, they said.Over the last four months, Brilliant Jewel, a floating storage facility chartered by Vitol, conducted ship-to-ship transfer operations with at least six vessels that previously loaded fuel at Russian ports, a Reuters analysis of shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.Vitol did not respond to a request for comment.A second Chinese fuel oil trader said companies have become more relaxed in dealing with Russian barrels after initial confusion over the Group of Seven price cap and the potential risk of running afoul of sanctions.""Initially the market took a wait-and-see stance before Dec. 5, but now many traders are moving fuel oil from these two hubs, with the top western traders being the more active,"" said the trader.Leading Chinese bunker suppliers and traders like Sinopec and PetroChina's Chimbusco have also been sending more Russian high-sulphur fuel oil to bunkering hubs in eastern China's Zhoushan and Qingdao, sources said.Sinopec and Chimbusco did not respond to requests for comment.Shipping records show the companies have chartered several fuel oil shipments from Malaysia's Tanjung Pelepas port to Zhoushan and Hong Kong over the last four months.(Reporting by Chen Aizhu and Jeslyn Lerh; Editing by Florence Tan and Tom Hogue)]"

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$171.1m-US$198.3m-US$17.0mUS$1.40bUS$1.75bUS$2.02bUS$2.24bUS$2.43bUS$2.59bUS$2.72bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 15.18%Est @ 11.22%Est @ 8.45%Est @ 6.51%Est @ 5.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$154-US$160-US$12.3US$908US$1.0kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$987US$932(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.0bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (11%– 2.0%) = US$30bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$10bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$17b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$104, the company appears quite good value at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Wynn Resorts as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.555. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Wynn ResortsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for WYNN.OpportunityForecast to reduce losses next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Indeed, airports became veritable ghost towns as few people wanted to be stuck in a flying tube with strangers. Fortunately, with the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, society everywhere began gradually normalizing.Moving forward, one of the biggest catalysts for travel stocks to buy centers on the reopening of China. For the longest time, government officials there imposed a draconian zero-Covid policy. However, with the world’s second-largest economy gradually integrating back into the global network, circumstances bode well not only for vacationers but for commerce as a whole.Just as importantly, industry experts project a rebound in business travel this year. With loosened restrictions everywhere, such a forecast isn’t surprising. Moreover, major enterprises recently put an end to remote work, likely inspiring other businesses to do the same. Collectively, this dynamic supports in-person interactions, which in turn may bolster the below travel stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDALDelta Air Lines$38.68UALUnited Airlines$48.67HLTHilton$143.52CHHChoice Hotels$122.24WYNNWynn Resorts$100.43HTZHertz Global$17.36UBERUber$30.00Delta Air Lines (DAL)Delta airlines aircraft interior full of passengers. Why are so many flights overbooked?Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comWith most of the world ready to put behind it the disaster of the Covid-19 pandemic, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) may be one of the best travel stocks to buy. Primarily, fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus faded significantly. As well, with multiple travel destinations now fully open, people have a reason to fly the (relatively) friendly skies.However, Delta may have an edge compared to other U.S. carriers because of the business travel implications. According to Small Business Trends, Delta represents the best airliner for business travel. This lofty status takes into account stats such as the infrequency of mishandled baggage and creature comforts such as ease of reservations and check-ins.Story continuesTo be sure, Gurufocus.com warns investors that DAL rates as a possible value trap. However, I believe this warning appeared based on the hard numbers and not their context. For a more relevant view, consider Wall Street analysts, who peg DAL as a consensus strong buy.United Airlines (UAL)a jet takes off on a clear runway.Source: m.photo / Shutterstock.comWhile Delta may be in the driver’s seat when it comes to airlines-related travel stocks to buy, it’s not the only compelling idea. For those seeking to bank on the rise in vacationing demand, investors should look into United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL). Featuring an enviable partner network, United offers extensive options for those finally able to take that long-delayed vacation.Fundamentally as well, experts project that the underlying industry should return to profitability this year. Again, Covid fears faded substantially into the background. Moreover, with major tourist destinations such as China and Japan reopening over the past few months, international-flight demand should blossom. Therefore, investors shouldn’t be terribly concerned about poor financial metrics. Over time, these stats should normalize.Just as importantly, Wall Street analysts have an optimistic view of United, pegging its shares as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $56.60, implying an upside potential of over 16%. Thus, UAL ranks among the travel stocks to buy.Hilton Hotels (HLT)Hotel roomSource: Dragon Images / ShutterstockBecause of consumer-related challenges – particularly skyrocketing inflation throughout 2022 – mentioning Hilton Hotels (NYSE:HLT) might seem imprudent. After all, we’re talking about a premium brand among travel stocks to buy. Still, HLT deserves another look. Fundamentally, it could end up surprising some folks.For one thing, the negativity in media headlines overlooks that certain people did very well during the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s not just my opinion – it’s hard data. With the wealth gap widening, the global health crisis effectively put more money into the hands of the rich. Therefore, those consumers of means are seriously loaded, boding well for Hilton Hotels.On another level, consumers of more modest means effectively put off their vacation plans for three years. By logical deduction, the magnitude of cabin fever may have accelerated. So, it wouldn’t be out of the question for consumers to splurge, again potentially benefitting Hilton. Finally, HLT features a consensus moderate buy view. Thus, it’s worth considering HLT as one of the top travel stocks to buy.Choice Hotels (CHH)an empty, sunlit hotel roomSource: ShutterstockAnother idea to consider among travel stocks to buy would be Choice Hotels (NYSE:CHH). Representing one of the largest hotel chains in the world, Choice owns several upscale brands. However, it also specializes in more economical offerings, likely to draw favor among a range of travelers. That’s going to be important as societies gradually recover from the health crisis and economic headwinds.To be sure, CHH suffered many downsides throughout 2022. And in the trailing year, shares stumbled over 13%. Another factor that investors should watch out for centers on analysts’ assessment. Per TipRanks, experts rate Choice as a consensus moderate sell with a price target that implies 5% downside. However, since the January opener, CHH gained nearly 13% of its equity value.On the financial end, Choice absorbed damage but should hold up well as sector sentiment improves. For instance, its three-year free cash flow growth rate stands at 17%, beating out over 62% of the competition. Also, it’s a very profitable enterprise, beating out 90% of its rivals across key performance indicators.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockA Las Vegas-based powerhouse, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) is one of the travel stocks to buy that couldn’t wait for the Covid-19 crisis to fade. During the first year of the pandemic, historical visitations fell by more than half compared to recent pre-pandemic years. As well, Wynn’s Macau properties suffered badly due to severe Covid restrictions in the region.However, with the world now on the same page regarding economic reopening, WYNN ranks among the travel stocks to buy. Indeed, the bulls already stepped up to the plate, with WYNN shares gaining over 20% since the January opener. Further, in the trailing six months, shares shot up over 62%.Currently, Wall Street analysts peg WYNN as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, although hedge funds exited exposure to the casino and resort in earlier years, TipRanks now reports that sentiment among this class of institutional investor rates as positive. With China being the prior headwind that’s now fading into the background, WYNN can really fly.Hertz Global (HTZ)Used car market: a row of cars of different makes and models sitting on a lot.Source: Mikbiz / ShutterstockBack during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, the bankruptcy of Hertz Global (NASDAQ:HTZ) symbolized the devastation of the pandemic. However, management now seeks to put that awful time behind it. With the world pushing forward toward the usual way of doing things before the SARS-CoV-2 virus interruption, Hertz now enjoys a fundamental tailwind.For one thing, with business travel projected to increase significantly compared to 2022 levels, Hertz should benefit from increased demand. As well, vacationers will likely see much benefit from its core rental car service. Better yet, investors appear to carry strong confidence in this broader narrative. Since the January opener, HTZ gained 17% of its equity value.Further, Wall Street analysts rate HTZ as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $20.33, reflecting nearly 16% upside potential. To be fair, it’s a risky idea. However, the emerging relevance could make it one of the travel stocks to buy.Uber (UBER)2 Critical Reasons Uber Stock Will Weather the PandemicSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comConsistently unprofitable quarter after quarter, ride-sharing giant Uber (NYSE:UBER) presents one of the riskiest propositions among travel stocks to buy. However, it also managed to be fundamentally relevant throughout the pandemic. When people stopped ordering rides during the crisis, the company’s food-delivery service Uber Eats gained prominence.Of course, it’s difficult to ignore the troubles the company faced in 2022. During the trailing year, UBER gave up nearly 19% of its equity value. Since making its public market debut, shares fell nearly 27%. At the same time, travel sentiment improvements should help engineer upside for UBER. Indeed, since the January opener, the stock moved up almost 20%.Even though the net losses contributed to Gurufocus.com warning its users that UBER poses a threat as a possible value trap, Wall Street analysts would beg to differ. They view the ride-sharing platform as a consensus and unanimous strong buy. As well, their average price target of $44.83 implies nearly 48% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

NextEra Energy Resources continues to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, adding more than 8,000 megawatts (MW) to its backlog in 2022. Also in 2022, FPL, the national leader in solar energy, placed approximately 450 MW of cost-effective solar in service, and began construction of the FPL Cavendish NextGen Hydrogen Hub – Florida's first-of-its-kind ""green hydrogen"" facility – which is scheduled to open later this year.Investing in American infrastructure – In 2022, NextEra Energy invested more than $19 billion in clean energy infrastructure, making NextEra Energy among the largest capital investors across any industry in the U.S.Providing outstanding value for shareholders – NextEra Energy outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index by nearly 10% in 2022. In terms of total shareholder return, NextEra Energy has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index and the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index on a three, five-, 10- and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, NextEra Energy has outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Index and more than tripled the average total shareholder return of the index.Delivering clean, low-cost energy – NextEra Energy has one of the lowest emissions profiles of any utility in North America. In 2021, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide rates were 98%, 74% and 51% lower, respectively, than the U.S. electric power sector average. In 2022, NextEra Energy announced Real Zero™, the most ambitious carbon-emissions-reduction goal ever set by an energy producer, seeking to eliminate carbon emissions from its operations by no later than 2045, while leveraging low-cost renewables to drive energy affordability for customers. A significant portion of NextEra Energy's plan to eliminate carbon emissions is designed to take place at FPL, which intends to achieve Real Zero across its operations at zero incremental cost for customers, relative to alternatives, and to keep FPL customer bills among the lowest in the country, just as they have been for more than a decade.Providing outstanding customer value – Consistently one of the nation's cleanest and most reliable electric utilities, FPL continues to deliver on its outstanding value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for 5.8 million customers in Florida. In 2022, FPL's relentless focus on productivity and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers helped keep residential customer bills the lowest among Florida investor-owned utilities and more than 30% below the national average.Providing outstanding reliability – FPL was recognized in 2022 for the seventh time in eight years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Last year, FPL delivered its best-ever service reliability and was named a recipient of the ReliabilityOne™ National Reliability Excellence Award. The prestigious award, presented by PA Consulting, reflects FPL's continued focus on customer service, technology deployment, operational successes and data analytics.Responding to unprecedented natural disasters – In 2022, FPL responded to two major storms in Florida with hurricanes Ian and Nicole. Hurricane Ian made landfall as a high-end category 4 hurricane and one of the most powerful and destructive storms ever to make landfall in the continental U.S. Yet, with significant preparation and valuable storm-hardening investments, FPL restored service to about two-thirds of the more than 2.1 million affected customers after the first full day of restoration, the fastest restoration rate in FPL's history for a major hurricane. Within eight days, FPL had restored service to essentially all FPL customers who were able to safely accept power.Story continuesView the complete results for Fortune's 2023 list of the ""World's Most Admired Companies.""NextEra Energy, Inc.NextEra Energy, Inc.

182,059959fb-7efd-3e36-b04c-e5c5cd19d3c7,NEE,2023-02-03,7 Stocks to Buy as the Doomsday Clock Ticks Closer to Midnight,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-doomsday-clock-185803725.html,1675105083,STORY,"['NEE-PR', 'IBM', 'HD', 'UL', 'K', 'RTX']","[Although considering stocks to buy might seem like a tertiary concern ahead of a potential global catastrophe, investors shouldn’t panic. Instead, rational preparation may be what the doctor ordered. Recently, headlines erupted about the so-called Doomsday Clock moving forward 90 seconds to midnight. It’s the closest the ominous indicator has been to the hour of reckoning. Still, it’s best to take a prudent approach to the macabre timepiece.Overseen by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the Doomsday Clock originally served to warn the public about imminent devastation. At first, the indicator focused on the threat of nuclear war. More recently, the dreaded timepiece incorporated human-caused disasters such as climate change.As a scientific predictor of stocks to buy (and not to buy), the Doomsday Clock brings virtually no significant value. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s completely useless. Reflecting general anxieties, this timepiece can potentially identify broad areas of need and/or concern. Below are specific companies to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMIBM.$135.22RTXRaytheon$98.72NEENextEra Energy$75.39SMRNuScale Power$10.84KKellogg$68.06ULUnilever$50.26HDHome Depot$315.90IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVWhile the Doomsday Clock originally entered the public spotlight because of broader fears of kinetic conflicts, in the modern age, people must also be aware of digital vulnerabilities. That’s why IBM (NYSE:IBM) may be a worthwhile investment. For quite some time, “Big Blue” failed to recognize the shifting tides of technology. However, its aggressive pivot to the cloud yielded significant rewards.Notably, IBM represented one of the few tech-centric stocks to buy that didn’t suffer catastrophic losses last year. Indeed, it managed to print a positive return (albeit a modest one). Moving forward, IBM’s myriad business units – including one covering cybersecurity – should augur well for the tech stalwart.Story continuesIn 2021, cybercrimes cost Americans $6.9 billion. Further, experts believe that by 2025, cybercrimes can cost the world $10.5 trillion. That’s not to say that kinetic conflicts won’t impact human societies because they clearly do. However, the digital realm continues to suffer vulnerabilities, which adds cynical value to IBM as one of the stocks to buy.Raytheon (RTX)A booth showcasing various technologies offered by Raytheon.Source: Jordan Tan / Shutterstock.comGiven both domestic and international challenges, it’s important for ethical content distributors not to glorify certain controversial industries. Therefore, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) will be the only name on this list that mostly ties into the defense sector. Still, since we’re talking about the Doomsday Clock, I’d be remiss not to mention at least one military-related company.While Raytheon features a wide range of relevant weapons systems, for this discussion, I’m going to focus on its Patriot missile defense system. In Dec., the Patriot garnered headlines as the U.S. government gave the green light for its deployment in Ukraine. Beyond this terrible conflict in Eastern Europe, the Patriot will likely gain enormous relevancy.After all, it’s not just the Russians that have demonstrated worrying belligerence. If the Doomsday Clock ever ticks to midnight, at least the U.S. and its allies will be prepared. Currently, Wall Street analyst rate RTX as a consensus moderate buy.NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockA significant reason why the Doomsday Clock moved the closest to utter doom is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, it’s also fair to point out that such an audacious move may not have materialized if the west wasn’t so dependent on hydrocarbons. If Russia didn’t have such enormous leverage on particularly west European countries, it would have thought twice.Now that such dependencies forced a wake-up call, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) may be one of the best stocks to buy. As one of the biggest investors in renewable energy infrastructures, NextEra aims to ultimately foster energy independence. This way, countries won’t have to overwhelmingly capitalize on nations with questionable intentions. As well, the subsequent loss of economic power will cause belligerent countries to rethink their aggressiveness.Almost as a bonus, NextEra can foster superior outcomes for the environment. It’s important to note that hydrocarbons may not ever go away. Still, we can reduce our dependency on them, making NEE one of the stocks to buy at midnight hour.NuScale Power (SMR)clean energy stocks: a nuclear power plant in BelgiumSource: engel.ac / ShutterstockMentioning nuclear power specialist NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) in a story about stocks to buy in the shadow of the Doomsday Clock presents all kinds of irony. Conspicuously, the threat of nuclear warfare undergirded the creation of the clock itself. Still, it’s important to remember one scientific reality: nuclear is a zero-emission clean energy source.As well, nothing comes close to the energy density of nuclear power. Per the Nuclear Energy Institute, one uranium fuel pellet has as much energy potential as 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 149 gallons of oil or one ton of coal. Pound for pound, you’re not going to get anything close to this magnitude of density from any other source.Therefore, the question comes down to safe and effective operation. With NuScale’s small modular reactor (SMR) facilities, nuclear energy networks can be installed much closer to the source of demand. Further, SMRs feature state-of-the-art safety protocols, helping to put minds at ease. For forward-thinking investors, it’s one of the stocks to buy.Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAs a multinational food manufacturing company, Kellogg (NYSE:K) basically offers permanent relevance. After all, no matter how advanced we become, people will still need to eat. In many ways, then, Kellogg benefits from inelastic demand. That is, no matter what’s going on with the economy, people will fork over money for a minimum of sustenance.However, under the context of the Doomsday Clock, Kellogg ranks among the stocks to buy for its plant-based meat division. Called Incogmeato, the company follows the trend set by other pure-play leaders in the space. Nevertheless, the advantage that Kellogg holds centers on economies of scale. Essentially, the pure plays suffered badly because their products ring up more expensively than their real-meat counterparts.Naturally, the size of the Kellogg juggernaut makes Incogmeato a more credible competitor in the plant-based meat space. And as meatless alternatives integrate into the wider food value chain, they can possibly promote superior climate outcomes. Therefore, K represents one of the stocks to buy to mitigate the Doomsday Clock.Unilever (UL)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockBack during the chaos of 2020 when the U.S. not only struggled with the coronavirus but also deeply seated social issues and inequities, Unilever (NYSE:UL) stepped forward and issued a commitment to racial justice. Part of its broad initiatives included financial support for social justice activist organizations. As well, Unilever implemented internal diversity programs to actively bolster underprivileged communities.For those that followed Unilever over the years, its response to the social climate of Covid-19 wasn’t surprising. A few years ago, the company in conjunction with other enterprises launched programs to help promote peace in conflict zones. While the Doomsday Clock may be heading toward disaster, Unilever isn’t sitting around, constantly promoting various initiatives to better the condition of humanity.Now, I’m not naïve to the fact that Unilever also attracted criticism for being “woke” or pandering to progressive ideologies. Still, it’s one of the few capitalistic enterprises putting its money where its mouth is. If you believe in investing for the greater good, UL represents one of the stocks to buy.Home Depot (HD)Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukIf the climate-related disasters inherent in the Doomsday Clock reaching judgment day ever materializes – obviously, not much can be done about the nuclear component – then Home Depot (NYSE:HD) offers an intriguing choice for stocks to buy. While other companies like NextEra Energy promote initiatives that should mitigate negative environmental developments, Home Depot could potentially benefit from inclement weather conditions.Now, please hear me out: I’m not saying that if Oklahoma-style tornadoes become an everyday occurrence in places like say, Los Angeles, California, that Home Depot will benefit. Rather, if we incur manageable weather events at greater frequency, then HD could become one of the stocks to buy.Cynically, sales at the home-improvement retailer increased in years of devastating natural disasters. As well, even mundane events – such as warmer weather – boosted demand for HD.Currently, Wall Street analysts rate Home Depot as a consensus moderate buy. And who knows? If the Mother Nature portion of the Doomsday Clock strikes midnight, HD shareholders might party like it’s 1999.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of Behr paint, Delta faucets and other building products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.5%.Revenues are expected to be $1.91 billion, down 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.21% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Masco?For Masco, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Masco will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Masco would post earnings of $1.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.98, delivering a surprise of -8.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Masco doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

California will ban the sale of new ICE cars effective 2035 and ensure that 100% of new car and truck sales are electric by 2035 and 2045, respectively.Story continuesThe acceleration of EV targets is offering opportunities to automakers. With consumers’ confidence in EVs rising fast, automakers are prioritizing their resources toward the sale of new energy vehicles, and sales of green vehicles are rocketing. Last year, global sales of EVs jumped roughly 70% year over year to 7.8 million vehicles, accounting for 10% of all new cars sold in 2022. Per S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts, around 10 million EV units will be sold in 2023, accounting for 14% of the total new vehicle sales.China Vehicle Market Fending off Challenges: Vehicle sales in China, the world’s largest car market, witnessed the second straight year of growth in 2022. Auto sales managed to maintain momentum last year even in the face of COVID resurgences, commodity inflation, chip crunch and supply chain snarls. According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, a total of 26.86 million vehicles were sold in the country last year, marking a 2.1% increase from the 2021 level. Importantly, sales of EVs almost doubled last year, hitting a record high.Despite the COVID-19 resurgence in the country and economic concerns, Cui Dongshu — Secretary-General of China Passenger Car Association — believes that China could see around 1% in annual growth in its car market in 2023, with fewer sales in the earlier months before they pick up speed toward the end of the year. Sales of new energy vehicles in China are expected to grow 30% year over year.European Market on the Recovery Track: Per the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (“ACEA”), the European Union passenger vehicle market rose 12.8% last month to 896,967 units, marking the fifth straight month of growth. However, for full-year 2022, new car registrations contracted 4.6% to 9,255,930 units, owing to supply chain snarls and chip concerns, largely in the first half of the year. Encouragingly, ACEA envisions sales of new cars in Europe to recover in 2023 notwithstanding the broader economic uncertainty. Sales are expected to rise roughly 5% year over year to reach 9.8 million vehicles in 2023.India Outstrips Japan as the 3rd Largest Market: India’s auto industry posted its highest-ever vehicle sales last year, overtaking Japan to become the third-largest vehicle market in 2022. Per the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, more than 3.79 million units of passenger vehicles were sold in India in 2022, up roughly 23% year over year. India is hopeful that the growth momentum will sustain this year. In terms of output, India retains its fourth spot. For the first time, it manufactured more than 5 million vehicles in 2022. Per S&amp;P Global Mobility, India’s light vehicle production is expected to grow 5-8% on a yearly basis in 2023.Cost Headwinds Prevail: The Russia-Ukraine war has triggered a second round of global microchip shortage and supply chain disruptions. Although supply chain snarls are gradually abating, they are far from over. Industry participants are battling high commodity, freight, fuel and logistics costs. Moreover, aggressive EV spending might put near-term operating margins and cash flow under pressure. While the ramp-up of EV targets will offer opportunities to automakers, it will also escalate capex and R&amp;D expenses as they transition from gas-powered models.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Foreign industry is a 27-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector.

China abandoned its strict ""zero-COVID"" policy in early December after protests against the restrictions, allowing people to travel and the virus to spread rapidly throughout the country.""Most ingredients in our restaurant have been sold out during Lunar New Year holidays, as we didn't expect so many customers,"" 33-year-old surnamed Zhang, a restaurant manager in Beijing told Reuters this week, ""throughout the whole holidays, we can sell 400-600 signature dishes a day, much more than before.""""After being hit by the latest wave of COVID infections, the primary focus of economic work should be on accelerating economic recovery and promoting normalised production and social order,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.The economy's reopening also boosted services exports, with the sub-index of new export orders increasing into expansionary territory in January from a contraction in December.Story continuesLast month, firms surveyed said they grappled with rising energy and raw material costs, staff reductions and an increase in the backlog of work.However, firms were still bullish about recovery prospects for the next 12 months after the full scrapping of China's protracted zero-COVID policy, with the confidence index hitting the highest since February 2011.""Improving expectations, restoring confidence, increasing income, expanding consumption, and stimulating domestic demand will be among the priorities,"" Wang said.Caixin/S&amp;P's composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, rose to 51.1 in January from 48.3 the previous month, marking the first expansion in five months.This week in a study session of the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, Chinese President Xi Jinping telegraphed plans to revive consumption, a major challenge facing the economy.The Caixin PMI is compiled by S&amp;P Global based on responses to questions sent to purchasing managers in China.

190,fd600ff5-6851-380e-b687-3095a4523273,SPGI,2023-02-03,S&P Global (SPGI) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-global-spgi-expected-beat-150003198.html,1675350003,STORY,['SPGI'],"[S&amp;P Global (SPGI) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis independent ratings and analytics provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -21.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.87 billion, up 37.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for S&amp;P Global?For S&amp;P Global, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.23%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that S&amp;P Global will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that S&amp;P Global would post earnings of $2.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.93, delivering a surprise of +5.02%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.S&amp;P Global appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Synchrony is committed to providing the resources and expertise to advance equity for diverse businesses and communities.”Project Black invests in middle-market companies that are not currently minority owned, as well as existing Black- and Hispanic-owned businesses, providing capital, resources and minority executive talent. Under Project Black’s ownership, these companies are expected to be transformed into certified minority business enterprises (“MBEs”) of scale to fuel Fortune 500 vendor and supply chain diversity. Synchrony, along with other investors, plans to explore collaboration opportunities with portfolio company management teams to pursue growth strategies.“Synchrony’s partnership will help fuel widespread corporate vendor and supply chain diversity. With their support, we look forward to creating consequential middle-market businesses, changing the perception of what it means to be a minority-owned enterprise in the United States,” said Leslie A. Brun, Chairman and CEO of Ariel Alternatives. “We are delighted and honored to have Synchrony as an investor in Project Black.”According to CEO Action for Racial Equity, in 2020, Fortune 500 companies directed an average of two percent ($125 billion) of their total spend to minority-owned businesses, yet many have pledged to dramatically increase their spend. With 95 percent of minority businesses having less than $5 million in revenue, few have the scale to tap into this $1 trillion opportunity.Story continuesAdvancing equity, diversity and inclusionThese efforts build upon Synchrony’s ongoing commitment to treat equity, diversity and inclusion as a strategic business imperative and drive long term progress. The company’s holistic approach includes advancing financial opportunities and growth among diverse businesses and communities.Synchrony and Synchrony Ventures have pledged $20 million to date in venture capital funds led by Black, Hispanic and female investing partners. The funds selected include Company Capital, Chingona Ventures, Seae Ventures, Trail Mix Ventures and Zeal Capital Partners. The company also signed the National Venture Capital Association’s (NVCA) human capital pledge in 2020 to advance a more diverse and inclusive venture ecosystem.Since 2021, the company has strengthened its supplier diversity program by expanding internal initiatives and external outreach. As a result, in 2022, Synchrony achieved a 180 percent increase in the number of proposal submissions by diverse suppliers and nearly 70 percent of those were selected to do business with Synchrony. As a member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council, the company continues to identify and use diverse suppliers whenever possible.Synchrony and the Synchrony Foundation’s $50 million, five-year initiative, Education as an Equalizer, increases access to higher education, skills training in high-growth fields, and financial empowerment for underserved communities and its own workforce.In 2020, the Synchrony Foundation committed $5 million to support funding of small business grants through community organizations such as the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) that provides emergency grants to minority- and women- owned businesses and Operation Hope which offers technical support and financial counseling. To date, more than 620 small business owners have received grants and support. Synchrony has been highly successful in its effort to hire, develop and advance diverse talent within its own organization through a data-driven approach. The company has included diversity improvements among the metrics used to determine bonus funding for Synchrony leaders. Synchrony has also redesigned its leadership development programs so diverse employees can gain executive coaching, sponsorship and mentorships with senior leaders.The company has committed to hire, upskill, advance and improve retention for Black talent without four-year degrees into middle skill and family-sustaining wage jobs. Synchrony has joined OneTen, a coalition of leading companies that is committed to creating a more inclusive corporate America by hiring and promoting one million Black individuals into family-sustaining jobs over the next decade. Synchrony hosts an annual Global Diversity Experience for all employees, leaders and members of its Board of Directors to deepen understanding while advancing a culture of belonging and well-being for all.]"

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Largest Petrochemical Companies in the World.Petrochemicals are an essential part of our daily lives because of their ability to transform oil and gas into a variety of everyday products like plastics, fertilizers, packaging, apparel, digital devices, medical equipment, detergents, and tires. They are used in many components of the contemporary energy system, including solar panels, wind turbine blades, batteries, thermal insulation for buildings, electric car components, and essential items for our daily lives. Petrochemicals are becoming ever more crucial to the global energy system, where they already play a significant role. Since the turn of the millennium, demand for plastics, the most well-known petrochemical goods, has exceeded that of all other bulk materials (such as steel, aluminum, or cement). However, the industry has been in the headlines recently as it contributes to global carbon emissions, and climate activists have been pushing for the industry to move towards more sustainable production.The global petrochemical market size is projected to be valued at $798.8 billion by 2030, increasing from $523.56 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 5.4%. The U.S. Energy Information Agency’s International Energy Outlook projects that fossil fuels will supply 60% of primary energy consumption globally in 2050. The United States is a leader in the low-cost production of petrochemicals. Petrochemicals industrial production in the country is expected to be worth $79.8 billion in 2022 and is largely concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina.Largest Petrochemical Companies tcly / shutterstock.comAccording to the Energy Information Administration, USA's operable crude refining capacity was 17.94 million b/d on January 1, 2022, down from 18.09 million b/d at the start of 2021 and a record high of 18.98 million b/d in 2020 before the pandemic took hold. The estimate for 2022 is the lowest since 14.92 million b/d in 2014. EIA also mentions that refinery capacity might be lower than this figure because of the capacity reductions announced later in 2022. S&amp;P Global suggests various reasons for these refinery closures, including storm damage, pandemic effects, high operating costs, failure to finalize sales, lower future demand predictions, or conversions to generate more renewable fuels.Story continuesMoreover, the United States has not built any new refining capacity in decades. The last major refinery in the US came into operation in 1977 in Louisiana. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth made headlines last year when he stated that the United States would never build another refinery. His reasoning was simple: the national policy has been to restrict demand for petrochemicals, making this sector unappealing to investors, given that it takes a decade to recover the initial cost of building a refinery. His views are not incorrect; governments all over the world have been helping the electric vehicle industry to reduce the demand for petrochemicals. According to IHS Markit research, US oil and liquids demand might fall by around 25% from 20.3 million barrels per day in 2019 to an anticipated 15.3 million b/d in 2050. According to IHS's low-carbon policy scenario, US oil demand for transportation might fall to 7 million b/d by 2050. Globally, Equinor ASA predicts that demand for oil for transportation will shrink 47% between 2018 and 2050 if current trends continue, thanks to advances in fuel efficiency and electric vehicles.In the near future, the petrochemical industries of the Middle East and China will be the center of attention, with the EIA estimating that they will lead refining capacity increases in 2022 and 2023. The Saudi government is also pushing for a stronger presence in the downstream petrochemical industry to reduce its reliance on crude oil. To achieve this goal, Saudi Arabia has signed several deals with China to collaborate on various projects in the downstream oil business. Although most analysts believe that demand for petrochemicals will fall in the long term as the global economy shifts to more renewable resources, both the demand and supply of petrochemicals will increase in the next few years. According to McKinsey, continued growth in crucial end markets that utilize petrochemicals, such as packaging and construction, as well as economic development in China, India, and Southeast Asia, will boost demand. Meanwhile, the consulting firm expects supply to grow at a robust rate. However, in the ethylene market category, which dominates the petrochemicals industry, McKinsey predicts capacity to rise faster than demand, lowering profit margins in this segment.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 20 largest petrochemical companies in the world, we identified the biggest petrochemicals companies in major economies and ranked these companies in ascending order in order of their market cap.

197,4f9d8ca7-6e02-38bc-8848-4b44a59c1158,MA,2023-02-03,China boosts imports of fuel oil blended from Russian barrels,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-boosts-imports-fuel-oil-031147759.html,1675393907,STORY,['CL=F'],"[By Chen Aizhu and Jeslyn LerhSINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's independent refineries are ramping up imports of discounted fuel oil blended from Russian barrels to use as low-cost feedstock amid a shortage of government crude oil import quotas for some of them, according to trade sources and data.Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including the looming Feb. 5 embargo and price cap on refined products, have been pushing Russian fuel oil barrels eastward into Asia at attractive discounts since last year.These have been flooding the ship-to-ship transfer hubs of Malaysia and United Arab Emirates' Fujairah since the second quarter of 2022. Traders blend these barrels with other oils to rebrand the fuel oil's country of origin, clearing the way for ship insurance and financing that would otherwise be banned under the sanctions, trade sources said.Discounts offered on these fuel oil cargoes help to improve margins at Chinese independent refiners and replace crude that some companies are unable to import without quotas, the sources said. The trade also provides a way to get Russian oil to market and bring much-needed export earnings to Moscow.""We've been looking at Russian fuel oil since December. It is cheap and does not require (crude) import quotas,"" said an executive with an independent refiner in eastern Shandong province.The refiner has not received any government crude quotas for the past year or so and buys mostly straight-run fuel oil to produce diesel and gasoline, said the executive, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.These blended fuel oil barrels were last traded at about a $5 discount to benchmark crude ICE Brent on a delivered Shandong basis, said one source.High-sulphur fuel oil values relative to crude have plunged into deeper discounts since the second quarter last year, with cracks hitting record lows at end-October.China's total fuel oil imports surged to about 1.76 million tonnes in December, highest since September 2021, official customs data showed.Story continuesThe uptick was driven by a surge in shipments from Malaysia to more than a one-year high at 620,000 tonnes, while monthly imports from UAE rose to 471,000 tonnes, highest in two years.Meanwhile, direct imports of fuel oil from Russia slipped to 187,000 tonnes in December after peaking at 554,000 tonnes in October, even as total imports from Russia more than doubled year-on-year to 3.1 million tonnes in 2022.China’s fuel oil imports from Malaysia and the UAE surge in Q4 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lgpdknwqavo/China's%20fuel%20oil%20imports.png""The deep discounts offered are driving the trend as independent refiners are price sensitive. China is still recovering, with domestic demand for refined fuels uncertain,"" said Emril Jamil, Refinitiv's senior analyst for crude and fuel oil.""The trend will continue with the EU ban (on Feb. 5), with all natural outlets in Europe closed. Asia will continue to soak up cheaper Russian (fuel oil) barrels on top of crude,"" Jamil said.TRADING COMPANIESWestern trading houses have been the main suppliers of these fuel oil shipments to China, said four senior trading sources, who closely track the flows, adding that the elevated December levels will extend through February and beyond.One of the top suppliers channelling these barrels to China is Swiss-based trader Vitol, they said.Over the last four months, Brilliant Jewel, a floating storage facility chartered by Vitol, conducted ship-to-ship transfer operations with at least six vessels that previously loaded fuel at Russian ports, a Reuters analysis of shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.Vitol did not respond to a request for comment.A second Chinese fuel oil trader said companies have become more relaxed in dealing with Russian barrels after initial confusion over the Group of Seven price cap and the potential risk of running afoul of sanctions.""Initially the market took a wait-and-see stance before Dec. 5, but now many traders are moving fuel oil from these two hubs, with the top western traders being the more active,"" said the trader.Leading Chinese bunker suppliers and traders like Sinopec and PetroChina's Chimbusco have also been sending more Russian high-sulphur fuel oil to bunkering hubs in eastern China's Zhoushan and Qingdao, sources said.Sinopec and Chimbusco did not respond to requests for comment.Shipping records show the companies have chartered several fuel oil shipments from Malaysia's Tanjung Pelepas port to Zhoushan and Hong Kong over the last four months.(Reporting by Chen Aizhu and Jeslyn Lerh; Editing by Florence Tan and Tom Hogue)]"

It hit a session low of $79.72, its lowest since Jan. 11.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) ended down $2.49, or 3.3%, at $73.39, after trading between $78.00 and $73.13, its lowest since Jan. 5.Brent registered a 7.8% decline this week while WTI dropped 7.9%.U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in January amid a persistently resilient labour market, but a further moderation in wage gains should give the Federal Reserve some comfort in its fight against inflation.""The market can't decide whether it should be nervous about a recession or more worried about the Federal Reserve being aggressive with interest rates,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group.The U.S. central bank on Wednesday scaled back to a milder rate increase than those over the past year, but policymakers also projected that ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs would be needed.Increases in interest rates in 2023 are likely to weigh on the U.S. and European economies, boosting fears of an economic slowdown that is highly likely to dent global crude oil demand, said Priyanka Sachdeva, market analyst at Phillip Nova.European Union countries agreed to set price caps on Russian refined oil products to limit Moscow's funds for its invasion of Ukraine, the Swedish presidency of the EU said on Friday.EU diplomats said the price caps are $100 per barrel on products that trade at a premium to crude, principally diesel, and $45 per barrel for products that trade at a discount, such as fuel oil and naphtha.The Kremlin said the EU embargo on Russia's refined oil products would lead to further imbalance in global energy markets.Story continuesMeanwhile, ANZ analysts noted a sharp jump in traffic in China's 15 largest cities after the Lunar New Year holiday but said that Chinese traders had been ""relatively absent.""In U.S. supply, energy firms this week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs by the most since June 2020, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said.

While handset-related sales slumped 18% to $5.75 billion, that was higher than some analysts had predicted and topped an average estimate of $5.25 billion. Automotive sales jumped 58% from a year earlier to $456 million. Connected devices revenue climbed 7% to $1.68 billion.Under Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon, the company has accelerated its effort to sell chips for different industries, trying to lessen its dependence on the smartphone market. Still, Qualcomm’s sales decline and a disappointing outlook for the current period indicate that demand for mobile phones remains hamstrung by sluggish consumer spending on big-ticket items in an unsteady economy.The company’s shares, which initially rose following the earnings release, slipped about 2% in extended trading, accelerating their decline after chip customer Apple Inc. reported iPhone revenue for the December quarter that fell short of analysts’ estimates, showing that even the highest end of the market isn’t immune to smartphone woes.Qualcomm expects customers, who have accumulated large stockpiles of unused components, to wrap up their inventory-reduction efforts around the middle of the year, returning to more predictable order patterns in the second half. China’s lifting of Covid-related restrictions on its population should begin to help consumer demand in the world’s biggest market for phones, executives said on a conference call with analysts.Story continues“There is optimism that the second half could be better,” Amon said. “Beyond 2023 for Qualcomm we see many of our growth initiatives gaining scale.”Qualcomm shares, which have gained 24% so far this year, closed at $135.85 in regular New York trading. After the company’s report, they rose as high as $141.89 before dropping to $131.50.San Diego-based Qualcomm’s main product is the processor that runs many of the world’s best-known handsets. It also sells the modem chips that connect the iPhone to high-speed data networks. A chunk of Qualcomm’s profit also comes from licensing the fundamental technology that underpins all modern mobile networks — fees that phone makers pay whether they use Qualcomm-branded chips or not.The semiconductor maker has avoided some of the worst of the recent slowdown by winning more business at Samsung Electronics Co., which is using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors more in its Galaxy phones. Apple has also continued to buy from Qualcomm longer than projected as it continues to work on developing its own replacement chips.The company posted adjusted profit for the first quarter of $2.37 a share. Analysts on average were looking for per-share profit of $2.35.Revenue will be $8.7 billion to $9.5 billion in the fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm said Thursday in a statement, compared with analyst estimates for sales of $9.58 billion. Excluding certain items, profit in the current period will be as low as $2.05 a share, while the average projection was for per-share profit of $2.29.(Updates with comments from executives in fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Gets an MBAThat Zoom Meeting Really Could Have Been a Simple Phone CallWhen Financial Bubbles Are Hard to PopA Billionaire’s Son Battles a Turbulent WWE Over the Future of Pro WrestlingWhen Hackers Hobbled Ireland’s Hospitals, They Took Themselves Down, Too©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

This compares to earnings of $3.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.85%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $3.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.13, delivering a surprise of 0.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Qualcomm , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, posted revenues of $9.46 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.12%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $10.71 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Qualcomm shares have added about 25.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Qualcomm?While Qualcomm has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Qualcomm: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.23 on $9.41 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $10.06 on $39.61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Wireless Equipment is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, ViaSat (VSAT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 7.This provider of satellite and wireless networking technology is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -288.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 25.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.ViaSat's revenues are expected to be $673.07 million, down 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Expedia Group EXPE, Booking Holdings BKNG, BigCommerce BIGC and TripAdvisor TRIP.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 E-Commerce Stocks Set to Beat Q4 Earnings EstimatesE-commerce stocks continued to suffer from unfavorable market dynamics during fourth-quarter 2022.These stocks suffered since the pandemic-induced e-commerce boom has been cooling off in the past few quarters with the reopening of economies across the world. Further, the slowdown in consumer spending due to high inflation remained a concern. Also, e-commerce companies witnessed the brunt of inflationary pressure in the form of rising transportation and fulfillment expenses. Additionally, supply-chain constraints and labor shortages were overhangs.Nevertheless, solid momentum during the holiday season and record-high e-commerce sales are likely to have been a major tailwind.According to data from Adobe Analytics, consumers spent a staggering $211.7 billion on online purchases between Nov 1 and Dec 31, up 3.5% on a year-over-year basis. This marked a new record for e-commerce sales. Cyber week recorded $35.3 billion in online sales, up 4% year over year.Increasing demand for ultra-fast and door-to-door delivery of orders for essentials, medicines, groceries and luxury items is expected to have contributed well.Additionally, the impacts of the growing proliferation of Internet use and online payment apps globally are expected to be reflected in the e-commerce companies’ results for the quarter under review.Apart from online retail companies, the Internet-Commerce industry houses online travel booking companies. These stocks are expected to have continued gaining on the boom in the travel industry. Relaxation of travel restrictions and growing confidence among the people are expected to have bolstered bookings of online travel stocks during the fourth quarter. Moreover, increased consumer demand for travel industry-related services might have been a positive.Story continuesHow to Make the Right Pick?With the presence of several industry participants, finding the right e-commerce stocks with the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting.

210,bdf0d4da-8dcd-3a43-9853-4fec0c8dfd1c,EXPE,2023-02-03,Expedia (EXPE) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expedia-expe-earnings-expected-grow-150103641.html,1675350063,STORY,['EXPE'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Expedia (EXPE) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis online travel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +74.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.68 billion, up 17.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 28.52% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Expedia?For Expedia, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Expedia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Expedia would post earnings of $3.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.05, delivering a surprise of +4.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Expedia appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stocks were left for dead last year as mortgage rates jumped over 7%. Sales of existing, and new homes, plunged virtually overnight.Wall Street thought the homebuilders were doomed with higher mortgage rates. Many people believed that this could be a replay of 2008 with inventory soaring, foreclosures and short sales, and prices plunging. The last place you would want to be in 2008 2.0 is in the homebuilder stocks.Has Housing Already Bottomed?But rates have come down off 2022 highs and the 30-year fixed is around 6%. According to some of the national, publicly-traded, homebuilders demand has picked up again. Is it a boom time again? No. But orders aren’t as bad as last year.Even more importantly, homebuilder margins are remaining elevated as lumber prices have fallen and other material costs have come down even though the builders are giving out more incentives, cutting prices and doing mortgage rate buydowns.The “Hope” TradeThe homebuilder stocks have rallied over the last 3 months on the “hope” trade for the spring season but they remain cheap on a P/E basis.Story continuesShould investors be diving back into the homebuilder stocks?3 Cheap Homebuilder Stocks1.

213,718af745-122c-34fd-837b-71704c0bcdf6,BAX,2023-02-03,Earnings Preview: Baxter International (BAX) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-baxter-international-bax-150003983.html,1675350003,STORY,"['BAX', 'PAHC']","[The market expects Baxter International (BAX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drug and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.77 billion, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.15% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Baxter?For Baxter, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Baxter will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Baxter would post earnings of $0.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.82, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Baxter doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsPhibro Animal Health (PAHC), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Products industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.30 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -18.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $238.44 million, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Phibro has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.48%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Phibro will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: MIRO) and Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced a collaborative research agreement to help support additional treatment options for patients with acute liver failure (ALF) in need of organ support therapies. As part of the collaboration, Miromatrix has created a new liver therapy called miroliverELAP that combines a Miromatrix single-use bioengineered liver with Baxter’s PrisMax system. Miromatrix submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for miroliverELAP to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2022, which appears to be the first IND for a bioengineered organ. Miromatrix intends to commence a Phase I clinical trial using miroliverELAP to treat patients suffering from ALF, following FDA’s decision that the trial may proceed. Baxter is both a collaborator and shareholder of Miromatrix.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230201005282/en/""Miromatrix believes that miroliverELAP has the potential to save and improve the lives of ALF patients while simultaneously increasing the availability of livers for transplant into other patients,"" said Jeff Ross, Ph.D., Miromatrix CEO. ""We are excited to be partnering with Baxter to pioneer this next generation innovation in acute care and liver disease.""ALF is a serious condition with limited clinical interventions. Over 50,000 people in the United States die from liver failure each year,i often because they cannot receive a liver transplant in time.ii However, the liver is capable of regenerating itself back to health in certain circumstances, making therapy to support the native liver during ALF highly clinically relevant. MiroliverELAP is designed to provide external support to the patient’s native liver as a bridge-to-transplant or bridge-to-recovery, potentially helping to avoid a liver transplant. The miroliverELAP Phase I clinical trial will serve as a foundational building block to start generating evidence on how this pioneering therapy may help support patients with ALF.Story continuesMiromatrix’s bioengineered liver is designed to replicate key functions of a human liver and is connected to Baxter’s PrisMax system outside of the patient’s body to create the miroliverELAP system. MiroliverELAP is designed to provide therapeutic support to ALF patients in hopes their native livers will regenerate themselves back to health. Baxter’s PrisMax system is designed to help simplify delivery of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and other therapies, while providing hospitals the flexibility to meet the unique demands of the intensive care unit (ICU). As part of this collaboration, Baxter has created custom software and disposables to run the miroliverELAP treatments during the Phase I clinical trial.""Baxter is focused on promoting continuous innovation to advance our organ support therapies and further elevate care for patients with ALF and other critical conditions,"" said Brian Tufts, Vice President, Acute Therapies at Baxter. ""Combining Miromatrix’s pioneering bioengineered organ technology with Baxter’s expertise in critical care delivery and industry-leading PrisMax system has the potential to transform care for ALF patients.""About MiromatrixMiromatrix Medical Inc. is a life sciences company pioneering a novel technology for bioengineering fully transplantable human organs to help save and improve patients' lives. The Company has developed a proprietary perfusion technology platform for bioengineering organs that it believes will efficiently scale to address the shortage of available human organs.

Pfizer (PFE) is probably the only one in our coverage where it is still a significant part of it because it was their biggest business last year.""In fact, between Pfizer, Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY) this week — all of which had some COVID business— Pfizer is the only one that can still be evaluated on its pandemic business.""You kind of have to look at Pfizer as two different businesses. They have an ex-COVID business and the COVID business,"" Bansal told Yahoo Finance.But the company has been trying to pull the spotlight away from its COVID business, anticipating a decline in demand, and onto its broader pipeline, particularly as several blockbuster drugs will lose patent exclusivity in the next few years.Pfizer expects a loss of $17 billion from its pending patent cliff, but CEO Albert Bourla said on an earnings call this week that there are 19 products in the pipeline that will balance out that loss from its internal pipeline and external acquisitions. Pfizer also projected a decrease in sales of both the vaccine, Comirnaty, and its treatment, Paxlovid.Merck, meanwhile, has struggled with its COVID-19 business from the start. It failed to launch a vaccine, and its treatment, molnupiravir, has been a last resort for doctors. A recent study hasn't helped. The treatment has been linked to mutations of the virus — though none have been lethal or immune-evasive.Still, its drug is being considered for use in China, and the U.S. is removing requirements of a COVID positive test in order to get access to the treatments, which could open up the market for the drug. In addition, the company has been producing COVID-19 vaccines for Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which is also winding down its Covid business.Story continuesBut Merck is also facing a patent cliff for its biggest blockbuster, cancer drug Keytruda, even as it is expecting a reformulation to extend the patent.Meanwhile, Eli Lilly had a successful run with its COVID-19 monoclonal antibody, but the company recently took a hit on sales as the treatment is no longer effective against the latest variants. Its share of the COVID business is smaller, though.Bansal noted that he had even forgotten about the antibody.""Lilly is a really good growth story. ... I think today's weakness has less to do with the numbers, per se, and more to do with some rotation out of biotech and pharma,"" he said.""Overall, COVID is pretty much going to be zero for them this year, and I don't think investors even think about (Eli Lilly's) COVID business,"" Bansal added.The only other major COVID players, Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX), are expected to report earnings and 2023 outlooks later this month. Both, along with Pfizer, face a shift to a commercial market for vaccines this year. The latter has struggled to gain traction in the U.S. and the government is no longer purchasing doses, the impact of which remains to be seen.Pfizer's Bourla previously told Yahoo Finance he doesn't expect ""that people will comply"" with booster recommendations.""Complacency will be getting in the way, so I see that volumes of people that will be getting the vaccines will be less,"" Bourla said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"
217,51a2c091-5755-3921-ad61-a7bf29d68150,JNJ,2023-02-03,COLUMN-3M foes act fast to capitalize on J&J’s talc bankruptcy defeat,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-3m-foes-act-fast-224230273.html,1675377750,STORY,"['MMM', 'JNJ']","[(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Alison FrankelFeb 2 (Reuters) - When a U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday that Johnson &amp; Johnson can’t use the U.S. bankruptcy system to offload vast litigation exposure from product liability claims, the people who reacted most quickly were undoubtedly J&amp;J investors.Within hours of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision, investors drove J&amp;J’s share price down by nearly 4% -- its biggest one-day decline in years.But another, albeit much smaller, group of people was also roiled by Monday’s ruling from the 3rd Circuit: appellate lawyers who were finishing up friend-of-the-court briefs due on Wednesday in a 7th Circuit appeal by 3M Co that presents issues similar to those in the J&amp;J case.The lawyers' quick response to the 3rd Circuit’s ruling – redrafting sections of their briefs to add quotations and references to the J&amp;J decision – shows the deep significance of these cases for both plaintiffs and corporate defendants ensnared in mass tort litigation. If your appellate brief addresses an issue that could affect hundreds of thousands of people, it's worth rushing to beat a deadline.The 3M and J&amp;J appeals aren’t exactly the same, but both involve the big-picture question of whether corporations facing an onslaught of lawsuits can use the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to halt litigation and push for a global resolution via the Chapter 11 process.At the 7th Circuit, 3M is appealing a bankruptcy judge’s ruling that tens of thousands of military veterans who allege hearing loss from 3M earplugs can continue litigating against the parent company, despite the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of the 3M subsidiary that originally made the earplugs. Like J&amp;J, 3M shifted litigation liability to the subsidiary, Aearo Technologies, but also provided the bankrupt entity with an uncapped financial backstop to cover Aearo's liability.I should note here that both 3M and J&amp;J maintain that their products are safe and that the bankruptcy process is the best way to deliver a fair, efficient, global resolution of plaintiffs’ claims. J&amp;J has said it will seek review of Monday's ruling by the full 3rd Circuit.Story continues3M and its supporters from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other pro-business groups filed their 7th Circuit briefs in December, arguing, in essence, that because 3M and its bankrupt subsidiary are deeply intertwined in their exposure to the earplug lawsuits, the bankruptcy court erred by refusing to halt the litigation against 3M.3M's brief to the 7th Circuit relied heavily on 2022 precedent from the federal district court in J&amp;J's case, which held that J&amp;J was entitled to a stay on litigation involving talc products because the subsidiary it had created to assume liability for talc litigation had entered Chapter 11.That’s the ruling, of course, that was overturned on Monday by the 3rd Circuit, which concluded that the J&amp;J subsidiary’s bankruptcy should have been dismissed because the subsidiary was not actually in financial distress, thanks to a funding backstop from J&amp;J.I asked a 3M spokesperson for comment on the 3rd Circuit decision, which the company will presumably address in a reply brief at the 7th Circuit. He said only that 3M is supporting its bankrupt subsidiary in a mediation process in the Chapter 11.The 3rd Circuit’s ruling came too late to affect briefs at the 7th Circuit by two groups of plaintiffs who are suing 3M over the allegedly defective earplugs. In briefs last week, plaintiffs' lawyers from Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel &amp; Frederick and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan argued, in a nutshell, that the appeals court should not allow 3M to distort the bankruptcy process to channel lawsuits out of court and into a forum that will give the company extra leverage.After Monday's 3rd Circuit decision, as you would expect, Kellogg Hansen and Quinn Emanuel immediately alerted the 7th Circuit. In a Feb. 1 notice, they noted that there were key similarities between the 3M and J&amp;J maneuvers, including the parent company backstop for the bankrupt subsidiary. The 3rd Circuit’s reasoning, they said “is persuasive and relevant here.”Their point was amplified in some of those hastily redrafted friend-of-the court briefs I mentioned. The trial lawyers’ group American Association for Justice, for instance, added a robust discussion of the 3rd Circuit ruling to its brief, arguing that it showed how a parent company had steered its subsidiaries into an unwarranted bankruptcy merely “to escape accountability and preserve their own assets by not filing.”The lawyer who wrote the trial lawyer group’s brief, Jeffrey White, told me he had only a few hours, after the 3rd Circuit decision was published, to revise his 7th Circuit brief to highlight the 3rd Circuit’s conclusion that J&amp;J’s subsidiary wasn’t really in financial distress. “That gave us the thread to tie the cases together,” he said.Carl Cecere, who wrote a brief to the 7th Circuit on behalf of several U.S. senators and representatives who contend that bankruptcy law does not permit 3M’s strategy, said by email that he spent Monday afternoon reading the 3rd Circuit’s J&amp;J decision. He then added a paragraph to his 7th Circuit brief, describing J&amp;J’s “labyrinthine corporate restructuring,” but noting, “thankfully,” that “the 3rd Circuit rejected this attempted evasion.”Counsel for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Hyland Hunt of Deutsch Hunt, said by email that she also read the 3rd Circuit’s J&amp;J decision as soon as it came out. The J&amp;J ruling’s reasoning, she said, “dovetailed with one of the themes in our brief, that the Bankruptcy Code is not a litigation escape-hatch financially healthy corporations.”Hunt pulled a quotation from the 3rd Circuit opinion to support her argument that 3M’s strategy is at odds with plaintiffs’ constitutional right to a jury trial. She revised the VFW’s brief on Tuesday, with time to spare before Wednesday’s deadline.At least four other just-filed amicus briefs backing the 3M plaintiffs cite the 3rd Circuit’s decision. I doubt that the 7th Circuit needed a heads-up about the ruling’s significance in the 3M appeal, but the copious references in these briefs certainly provide it.Read more:Corporate lawsuit dodge imperiled after court rejects J&amp;J bankruptcy tacticU.S. court rejects J&amp;J bankruptcy strategy for thousands of talc lawsuitsSurprise!

The continuous interest rate hikes have made investors anxious about the stock market’s future. According to Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in January, investors broadly gave a pessimistic view of the market. However, over half of the respondents showed an inclination toward cheaper value stocks, considering their outperformance over growth equities in 2022. In addition to this, companies that have proven track records of dividend growth also made it to investors’ choice.Value stocks showed their greatest performance last year against growth equities since 2000, as reported by Bloomberg. Analysts expect the trend of value investing to continue this year as higher interest rates put margin pressures on the technology sector. Moreover, last year’s selloff was the worst for tech stocks since 2008, so investors are moving toward defensive quality stocks to stay afloat during this period. In this regard, dividend stocks regained their appeal, with dividend payments reaching their record high in 2022. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, compared with $511.2 billion in 2021. The report also mentioned that 373 companies in the S&amp;P 500 raised their dividend through December 15, up from 353 in 2021. These results show that companies have the sufficient cash flow to fulfill their shareholder obligation smoothly.AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) are some of the popular dividend companies that are gaining popularity among investors.

CAH.5 Top Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy in the Month of LoveDividend investing has remained the hottest segment of the stock market over the past year. Though U.S. stocks have resumed their strength this year on easing inflation and the Fed’s slower rate hike bets, recession worries persist. In such a scenario, dividends are major sources of consistent income for investors though they do not offer dramatic price appreciation. Stocks backed by regular dividends can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and tend to outperform in a choppy market.In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns. Honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Agilent Technologies, Republic Services Inc., Deere &amp; Co. and Cardinal Health Inc. — that investors would love to buy this month.Why is Dividend Growth Better?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Story continuesAlthough these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Here are five of the 21 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

At a pre-specified interim analysis review conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy then continued as single agent every six weeks for up to 14 cycles demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with chemotherapy alone in these patients whose endometrial carcinoma was either mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR).The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies; no new safety signals were identified. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and discussed with regulatory authorities.""Patients with advanced stage or recurrent endometrial cancer, the most common type of gynecologic cancer in the U.S., face a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. This is particularly notable in patients who progress after prior platinum-based adjuvant therapy with disease not amenable to curative surgery or radiation,"" said Dr. Ramez Eskander, principal investigator and gynecologic oncologist, University of California, San Diego. ""In this study, pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival in both the dMMR and pMMR study populations. We look forward to presenting these exciting findings at an upcoming scientific congress.""Story continues""In certain patients with advanced endometrial cancer who have progressed following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for surgery or radiation, KEYTRUDA has become an important treatment option, both as monotherapy and in combination,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These latest results in the first-line setting are very encouraging and show the potential of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy for patients with stage III to IV or recurrent disease regardless of mismatch repair status. We thank our collaborators for their partnership on this study, and we are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation.""This trial was sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. NRG Oncology designed and led the trial with funding from the NCI and participation from all the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Groups. Merck provided funding and support through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Merck and NCI.Merck has a comprehensive clinical development program in endometrial cancer. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA has two approved indications in endometrial cancer: in combination with LENVIMA® (lenvatinib), for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is pMMR, as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation; and as a single agent, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or dMMR, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.Additionally, Merck is evaluating KEYTRUDA in first-line advanced endometrial cancer both as monotherapy (KEYNOTE-C93/ENGOT-en15/GOG-3064) and in combination with LENVIMA (LEAP-001/ENGOT-en9), as well as in the adjuvant setting (KEYNOTE-B21/ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053).About NRG-GY018NRG-GY018 is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03914612) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) versus placebo plus standard of care chemotherapy alone for the treatment of measurable stage III, IVA, IVB or recurrent endometrial cancer in pMMR and dMMR cohorts. The primary endpoint is PFS, and secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled 819 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy every three weeks for approximately six cycles followed by KEYTRUDA as a single agent every six weeks for up to 14 cycles, or placebo plus chemotherapy. Enrolled patients were required to have MMR testing prior to randomization; approximately 70% of patients were pMMR, and approximately 30% were dMMR.About endometrial carcinomaEndometrial carcinoma begins in the inner lining of the uterus, which is known as the endometrium, and is the most common type of cancer in the uterus. This disease remains the only gynecologic malignancy with a rising incidence and mortality. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 66,000 new cases of uterine body cancer and approximately 13,000 deaths from the disease in 2023. Globally, endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and 15th most common cancer overall.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Endometrial CarcinomaKEYTRUDA, in combination with LENVIMA, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or dMMR, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis.

Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, the combination of lenvatinib with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity compared to either treatment alone.LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) Indications in the U.S.For the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)In combination with pembrolizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapyFor the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.Selected Safety Information for LENVIMAWarnings and PrecautionsHypertension.

Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L.

In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgment of adequate resolution.Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥30%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

Pfizer (PFE) is probably the only one in our coverage where it is still a significant part of it because it was their biggest business last year.""In fact, between Pfizer, Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY) this week — all of which had some COVID business— Pfizer is the only one that can still be evaluated on its pandemic business.""You kind of have to look at Pfizer as two different businesses. They have an ex-COVID business and the COVID business,"" Bansal told Yahoo Finance.But the company has been trying to pull the spotlight away from its COVID business, anticipating a decline in demand, and onto its broader pipeline, particularly as several blockbuster drugs will lose patent exclusivity in the next few years.Pfizer expects a loss of $17 billion from its pending patent cliff, but CEO Albert Bourla said on an earnings call this week that there are 19 products in the pipeline that will balance out that loss from its internal pipeline and external acquisitions. Pfizer also projected a decrease in sales of both the vaccine, Comirnaty, and its treatment, Paxlovid.Merck, meanwhile, has struggled with its COVID-19 business from the start. It failed to launch a vaccine, and its treatment, molnupiravir, has been a last resort for doctors. A recent study hasn't helped. The treatment has been linked to mutations of the virus — though none have been lethal or immune-evasive.Still, its drug is being considered for use in China, and the U.S. is removing requirements of a COVID positive test in order to get access to the treatments, which could open up the market for the drug. In addition, the company has been producing COVID-19 vaccines for Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which is also winding down its Covid business.Story continuesBut Merck is also facing a patent cliff for its biggest blockbuster, cancer drug Keytruda, even as it is expecting a reformulation to extend the patent.Meanwhile, Eli Lilly had a successful run with its COVID-19 monoclonal antibody, but the company recently took a hit on sales as the treatment is no longer effective against the latest variants. Its share of the COVID business is smaller, though.Bansal noted that he had even forgotten about the antibody.""Lilly is a really good growth story. ... I think today's weakness has less to do with the numbers, per se, and more to do with some rotation out of biotech and pharma,"" he said.""Overall, COVID is pretty much going to be zero for them this year, and I don't think investors even think about (Eli Lilly's) COVID business,"" Bansal added.The only other major COVID players, Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX), are expected to report earnings and 2023 outlooks later this month. Both, along with Pfizer, face a shift to a commercial market for vaccines this year. The latter has struggled to gain traction in the U.S. and the government is no longer purchasing doses, the impact of which remains to be seen.Pfizer's Bourla previously told Yahoo Finance he doesn't expect ""that people will comply"" with booster recommendations.""Complacency will be getting in the way, so I see that volumes of people that will be getting the vaccines will be less,"" Bourla said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Shares of two of the largest pharmaceutical companies, Merck and Eli Lilly, are falling after the companies reported their fourth quarter earnings. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani is here with the latest. Hello, my friend. What did we learn?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hi. Well, let's start off with Merck because that's, I think, the more interesting story. They have a lot of different things going on. Of course, with their earnings, we were looking at the impact from no longer COVID being a really important topic, at least for most of companies in that category, for 2023. They also did have a little bit of pressure from a report citing some concerns about their COVID treatment molnupiravir and the potential for new mutations as a result linked to that.So the company has denied that, but it seems like that is something weighing on the stock as well. Meanwhile, they are also facing a potential fall-off of Keytruda. That's something that's still on the radar for them in the outlook.Meanwhile, Eli Lilly, another COVID company, if you will, their monoclonal antibody totally took a hit. No longer an option, a viable option, against these new variants. So some pressure came from there, as well as disappointing sales of their diabetes drug, which had a little bit of momentum and a lot of excitement around the potential use as a weight loss drug as well. But sales missed there. So there's some pressure on that stock as well.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, we're looking at losses of just over 4% right now with about 50 minutes to go until the bell.

Drugmakers out with results as the companies try to explain their strategies in a post-COVID world. Joining us now, Mohit Bansal, Wells Fargo Managing Director of Biopharma Equity. And also with us is Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. So good to have you with us, Mohit.So we already saw what happened with Pfizer. What about other expectations for potentially some of these other companies as well who have had their pandemic-related medicines and treatments now forward-looking? What are you expecting in terms of guidance here?MOHIT BANSAL: Great. Thank you, Rachelle, for having me today. So like we saw with Pfizer as well, COVID is really highly uncertain for this year-- COVID is probably going to stay here, but the question is, what would be the testing rate? What would be the diagnosis rate? And how many people would actually go and get their COVID pills or vaccines?So because of that, I mean, I think most of the drugmakers-- I mean, Lilly has basically guided really-- guided for pretty much low expectations for this year. And Merck has also said only $1 billion in their COVID pill revenues. And Pfizer also brought down the expectation significantly.So overall, COVID is pretty much out of the models. Pfizer is probably the only one in our coverage where it is still significant part of it, because it was their-- it was their biggest business last year. But for rest of the companies, it is a smaller business now.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Mohit, it's Anjalee here. I know that Pfizer is a little bit in the rearview mirror right now, but I heard you on the call and I know that of the four companies we're looking at today, Pfizer is one of the three that really has a lot of pressure from COVID. And I've said that they're sort of back at square one compared to where they were in 2019 when Bourla first took over.Story continuesI mean, looking at what their quarters were, quarter-over-quarter absolutely blowout-- 80%, really high numbers in terms of operational growth. Now, they're looking at their pipeline and trying to figure out how to, number one, combat that loss of exclusivity, as well as sort of tempering expectations for the COVID products.But we do know that there is still demand there. What are you seeing in terms of-- what are your expectations in terms of this balance that's now going to be struck between the continued offsetting of revenue coming in from COVID versus the rest of the pipeline?MOHIT BANSAL: Right. So this is a great question. And the way we think about Pfizer, you kind of have to look at Pfizer as, like, two different businesses. They have an ex-COVID business, and the COVID business, because COVID is really uncertain here. So for COVID, they had more than $50 billion revenues last year.And that number is coming down to-- they guided for $13 billion or so for vaccine, $8 billion or so Paxlovid. So it's significantly declined. But the question is, how would it look like for a tail? Pfizer thinks that the tail could be bigger in terms of there could be vaccination rates improving in all over time, and the pricing could improve for vaccines.We think it could be a little bit of show-me story. We are modeling it to be a $6 billion sale, which is where most of the investors agree with. Pfizer's number could be in double-digit billion dollars or even higher there. So that's where the data is.But for the rest of the business, I think Pfizer has generated a ton of cash with the COVID business so they can actually go out and do more deals, which could help them offset some of the core business [INAUDIBLE] that are coming in 2025 and beyond. So that's how we see it.There is a tail for COVID, the question is how much it is. And then rest of the business-- can they offset the LOEs? It is, again, a show-me story. And that's the challenge of owning Pfizer right now.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: And talk to me about Lilly, because I know that diabetes drug, the myths that they got there. But we've also seen the excitement around the potential of it to be used as a weight loss drug. And so I wonder, what are we looking at in terms of this company also coming off of a two-company look with the COVID product, the monoclonal antibody, and then the rest of the pipeline. What are your thoughts about this new diabetes drug?MOHIT BANSAL: Right. So COVID is a significantly smaller part of Lilly's business versus Pfizer. I mean, I did not even remember that they had a COVID business until you mentioned it. That's how much people don't think about COVID for Lilly.Lilly is a really good growth story. And I mean, today, diabetes was a little bit weak-- or [INAUDIBLE] a little bit weak. But I think today's weakness has less to do with the numbers, per se, and more to do with some rotation out of biotech and pharma, given that we can see the NASDAQ is doing so well-- so probably rotation into the tech sector at this point probably.That's where we are heading. But, again, Lilly is one of the best growth stories in biopharma right now. However, the challenge is that you are paying for it. Multiples are clearly reflecting that. So that's why they really don't have a lot of room to miss.And when they came out a little bit lower on that consensus-- or, sorry, of course, consensus they came out a little bit lower, it hurt them a little bit more than others because this has been a high flyer for a while now. So that's why there is a rotation there. But overall, I mean, COVID is probably not-- COVID is pretty much going to be zero this year for them. And it is not-- and I don't think investors even think about COVID business.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Mohit, of course, I want to ask you about Merck. You do have an overweight rating for them. What do you like here? Obviously, a lot of disappointment at the moment, but then also looking forward, we know that they're going to be having some new product cycles coming up as well. What is giving you hope, at least for now, for Merck?MOHIT BANSAL: Right. So Merck, we like Merck because they have a base business with Keytruda, one of the biggest cancer drugs out there. And it's growing significantly. And it could become a $30 billion-plus product by the end of the decade.I think why we like it is because investors in general are concerned about Keytruda losing patent exclusivity in 2028 and beyond. And now, onus is on Merck to figure out pipeline so that they can offset that loss. And what we like about Merck is that they are working on it. They have cardiovascular pipeline. They acquired an asset from Axiron last year, or maybe a year and a half back.And that trial has worked out. They have an oral PCSK9 that can be combined with statins to provide 40% to 50% incremental cholesterol reduction. So that's a pill. So that could be a-- that could be a decent drug. So they have guided that in cardiovascular business, they can generate $10 billion revenues.And in oncology, [INAUDIBLE] they can generate another $10 billion product revenues. So you cannot eliminate-- you cannot completely offset Keytruda when it goes off patent, but then the Keytruda problem slower. So this will be an evolving story over time. And that's why we like the name.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We do appreciate you joining us with your insights-- Mohit Bansal there, Wells Fargo Managing Director of Biopharma Equity and Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Thank you both.]"

And separately, a new study identified COVID-19 mutations linked to the use of Merck's pills in viral samples taken from patients. For more on the risks linked to these drug mutations and their impact on Merck, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Can you explain this to us?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yes.- You actually already understand this concept.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Think of antibiotic resistance, right? So, we know that certain bacterial infections build up that resistance to the antibiotics, and we've now been dealing with that in hospitals-- superbugs, et cetera. This is sort of similar to that. So, this is not something that was completely unexpected. Prior to approval, even, there were many experts pointing to the methodology that this treatment uses and the fact that it could in fact follow that kind of process.And here, we have a study showing in a small sample that that could be happening. Merck, of course, denying that this is leading to any mutations. But there are experts warning about and looking into what the impact of this information could be, in particular the fact that these mutations could be linked to the drug but also the fact that, you know, Merck's pill has not been the favored one among the two options that have been out right now. Paxlovid, of course, we know Pfizer's pill has been the one that is more favored.But it also has drug interactions. So, Molnupiravir has been the one that has been a go-to as a backup and now, with the approval pending in China, could have a much bigger market. We've talked about that on this show. So, all in all, a really interesting sort of dynamic for Merck to deal with. And we'll just have to see how it truly does play out.Story continues- But-- so does Paxlovid not carry--ANJALEE KHEMLANI: The similar--- --kind of effect, and do the vaccines not have a similar kind of effect where it sort of drives the virus to--ANJALEE KHEMLANI: There has there has been discussion about that, right, whether or not these vaccines are causing adaptation and the like. But as it stands right now, the main driver of mutations that we've been finding is the spread of the virus itself. So, every time-- and I've said this in very simple terms before.Every time the virus is in a body, It has a chance to make a mistake of the copy of the DNA of the virus, and that's what a mutation is. And so that's really where the focus of these variants has been to date. Now, as we get into lower circulation and the like, yes, we're going to see some of these other, you know, sources of mutations come up on the floor.- We had some other earnings come out from the health care landscape earlier today as well. Which are the main ones we should be keeping tabs on?- So, Bristol-Myers Squibb is seeing a little bit of reduction in demand there for one of their multiple myeloma drugs, facing a lot of generic competition right now. So, keep your eye on that even though the stock is up right now. And then Eli Lilly, that's another big one COVID-related.We know that their antibody treatment, monoclonal antibody treatment, for the virus was one of the last men standing but now completely knocked out by these new variants. So they took a hit there on that. And meanwhile, they're also looking at their diabetes drug that is also being studied for weight loss. Really high demand there. But because of a reduction in sales, they took a hit this morning. So, those are the two things to look out for.- Yahoo! Finance health care reporter Anjalee Khemlani. Thanks so much, Anj, for breaking those down.]"

Earnings declined 10% year over year (7% excluding the impact of currency) due to higher tax rates.Including acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, income and losses from investments in equity securities, and certain other items, earnings per share were $1.18, down 17% (ex Fx) year over year.Revenues rose 2% year over year (8% on a constant currency basis) to $13.83 billion. Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion and our estimate of $13.48 billion.Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $12.18 billion, up 9% year over year driven by higher sales of oncology drugs and some vaccines.Keytruda, the largest product in Merck’s portfolio, generated sales of $5.45 billion in the quarter, up 19% (26% excluding Fx impact) year over year. Keytruda sales gained from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers, and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. Keytruda sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.57 billion as well as our estimate is $5.62 billion.The company’s COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) generated sales of $825 million during the fourth quarter, compared with $436 million in the previous quarter. Lagevrio sales were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $395 million as well as our estimate of $440 million. Higher sales in Japan and the United Kingdom were offset by a decline in the United States.Alliance revenues from Lynparza and Lenvima also boosted oncology sales in the quarter. Merck has a deal with British pharma giant AstraZeneca AZN to co-develop and commercialize PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, and a similar one with Japan’s Eisai for its tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima.Story continuesAlliance revenues from AstraZeneca-partnered Lynparza increased 14% year over year to $292 million in the quarter driven by increased demand. Lenvima alliance revenues were $216 million, up 9% from the year-ago period.In the hospital specialty portfolio, neuromuscular blockade medicine — Bridion injection generated sales of $441 million in the quarter, up 7% year over year.In vaccines, sales of HPV vaccines — Gardasil and Gardasil 9 — rose 6% year over year to $1.47 billion as strong demand in ex-U.S. markets, particularly China, offset softer sales in the United States due to the unfavorable timing of CDC purchasing. Gardasil sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.5 billion but slightly beat our estimate of $1.45 billion.Proquad, M-M-R II and Varivax vaccines recorded combined sales of $526 million, up 6% year over year. Sales of the rotavirus vaccine, Rotateq declined 31% to $139 million. Pneumovax 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent) vaccine sales declined 50% to $145 million due to declining demand in the U.S. market. Sales of Merck’s new pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine, Vaxneuvance, were $138 million due to inventory stocking in the United States.Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise sales were down 29% year over year to $913 million. The drug sales were hurt by lower demand and pricing in certain international markets due to generic competition. The drugs lost market exclusivity in China in July and the European Union in September last year.Merck’s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $1.23 billion, down 2% year over year due to currency headwinds. Excluding Fx impact, sales rose 6% in the quarter as higher sales of livestock products were partially offset by lower sales of companion animal products. Animal Health segment sales were less than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 billion.Margin DiscussionAdjusted gross margin was 75.7%, up 90 basis points year over year, driven by the favorable impact of currency and product mix.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $2.6 billion in the reported quarter, up 1% year over year due to higher administrative costs and higher promotional spending. Research and development (R&amp;D) spending was $3.0 billion, reflecting an increase of 14% year over year.Full-Year 2022 ResultsFull-year 2022 sales rose 22% (26% ex Fx) to $59.28 billion, marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $59.19 billion as well as the guided range of $58.5-$59.0 billion. Pharmaceutical sales grew 22% to $52.0 billion.Adjusted earnings for 2022 were $7.48 per share, up 43% year over year. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.40 per share as well as the guided range of $7.32 and $7.37.2023 GuidanceMerck issued a fresh earnings and sales outlook for 2023.Merck expects revenues to be in the range of $57.2 - $58.7 billion in 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $58.5 billion.Lagevrio is expected to generate $1.0 billion in sales in 2023, a significant decline from $5.7 billion in 2022.Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $6.80 to $6.95, which falls short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.16 per share.The guidance includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% on sales and 4% on earnings.The adjusted gross margin is expected to be approximately 77%.Adjusted operating costs are expected to be in the range of $23.1 to $24.1 billion. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% to 18%.Our TakeMerck’s fourth-quarter results were better than expected, as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Sales of its COVID-19 antiviral pill Lagevrio were better than expected, backed by higher demand in outside U.S. market. Though sales of key products cancer drug, Keytruda and Gardasil vaccine rose in the quarter, they were less than our expectations. Merck’s full-year profit outlook was below market expectations.Shares of Merck were down 1.9% in pre-market trading. The stock has rallied 35.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s increase of 9.2%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Nonetheless, Merck invested in M&amp;A activity in 2022 to strengthen its pipeline. These included the acquisition of Imago and key agreements with Moderna, Orna, Orion and Kelun-Biotech. Merck also made meaningful progress in its pipeline in the year.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMerck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked large drug stocks include Sanofi SNY and Novo Nordisk NVO, both with a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).Estimates for Sanofi’s 2023 earnings per share have increased from $4.31 per share to $4.41 in the past 30 days. Sanofi’s stock has declined 7.3% in the past year.Sanofi beat earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The company delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.50%, on average. Sanofi is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb 3.In the past 30 days, estimates for Novo Nordisk’s earnings per share have increased from $4.03 per share to $4.20 per share. Shares of Novo Nordisk have risen 30.4% in the past year.NVO reported its fourth-quarter results on Feb 1. Novo Nordisk beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for revenues.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Transocean (RIG) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$0.18 a share 19 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 21, 2023.Transocean's Earnings ESP sits at 6.9%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.18 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.19.RIG is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. Williams Companies, Inc. (The) (WMB) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on February 20, 2023, Williams Companies, Inc.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis RNA interference drug developer is expected to post quarterly loss of $2.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.4%.Revenues are expected to be $306.33 million, up 18.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 24.11% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alnylam?For Alnylam, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.44%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Alnylam will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alnylam would post a loss of $1.86 per share when it actually produced a loss of $3.32, delivering a surprise of -78.49%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Alnylam appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerIllumina (ILMN), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.26 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -65.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.06 billion, down 11.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Illumina has been revised 30.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -71.85%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Illumina will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MAA, commonly referred to as MAA, reported fourth-quarter 2022 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.32, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28. The reported number improved by 22.1% year over year.This residential REIT’s quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio. MAA also issued its outlook for 2023.Rental and other property revenues were nearly $528 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $525.5 million. The reported figure was 13.9% higher than the previous-year quarter’s $463.6 million.For the full-year 2022, the core FFO per share came in at $8.50, higher than the prior-year tally of $7.01 and also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.46. This was backed by 13.6% growth in total revenues to $2.02 billion.Per Eric Bolton, the chairman and chief executive officer of MAA, “We closed 2022 with better than expected results and carry good momentum into the new year. As the broader economy adjusts to a higher interest rate environment, we believe that MAA is well positioned to capture another year of solid performance from our existing portfolio. Supported by a strong balance sheet, the company is also in position to capture new growth opportunities that we believe are likely to emerge.”Quarter in DetailThe same-store portfolio’s revenues grew 13.6% on a year-over-year basis due to a rise of 14.9% in the average effective rent per unit.However, the average physical occupancy for the same-store portfolio in the fourth quarter declined by 40 basis points year over year to 95.6%. The resident turnover for the same period was 46.1%. Same-store portfolio operating expenses flared up 7.9%.For leases effective during the fourth quarter compared to the prior lease, same-store portfolio lease pricing increased 2.2% for leases to new move-in residents. This mirrored usually slower seasonal leasing volumes. For renewing leases, the same increased 10.1%. On a blended basis, this resulted in growth of 5.7% for new and renewing leases.Moreover, the same-store net operating income (NOI) reflected year-over-year growth of 16.8%.Story continuesBalance Sheet PositionMAA exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $38.66 million, down from the $54.3 million reported at the end of 2021.As of Dec 31, 2022, MAA had a strong balance sheet with $1.3 billion in combined cash and capacity available under its unsecured revolving credit facility. Also, it had a historically low Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 3.71.As of the same date, the total debt outstanding was $4.4 billion. Its total debt average years to maturity was 7.9 years.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. American International Group (AIG) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.26 a share 13 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 15, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.26 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.19 Zacks Consensus Estimate, American International Group has an Earnings ESP of 5.73%.AIG is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Mid-America Apartment Communities is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 26, 2023. MAA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.32 a share 83 days from its next earnings release.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mid-America Apartment Communities is $2.25, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.24%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, AIG and MAA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

They get after-market discounts from drugmakers to add treatments to the lists they recommend to insurers and companies offering coverage for employees.PBMs typically pass on most of the discounts, called rebates, to their clients and retain some in fees.Cigna's PBM unit has both Humira and Amgen's Amjevita on its list of covered drugs.Chief Executive David Cordani said in a conference call to discuss Cigna's fourth-quarter earnings that he anticipates ""value creation from the increased availability of biosimilars building in the second half of 2023 and ramping in 2024 and beyond.""Those gains will help partially offset the anticipated cost this year of setting up its contract to manage Centene Corp's annual pharmacy spend of around $40 billion.Cigna's insurance arm, meanwhile, faces a possible shift towards less profitable government-backed health programs due to chances of the U.S. economy's ""fragility"" pressuring enrollment in corporate plans, Cordani said.The company forecast a medical care ratio - the ratio of the amount paid out for medical services versus revenue brought in - of 81.5% to 82.5% for 2023. The midpoint is marginally higher than last year's 81.7% and a Wall Street estimate of 81.9%.Its annual profit forecast of at least $24.60 per share was marginally below expectations of $24.84 per share.Shares of Cigna were down 1% at $298.44.(Reporting by Leroy Leo in BengaluruEditing by Vinay Dwivedi and Devika Syamnath)]"

Adjusted income from operations is defined as shareholders' net income (or income before income taxes less pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the segment metric) excluding net realized investment results, amortization of acquired intangible assets and special items. Cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. Adjusted income (loss) from operations is measured on an after-tax basis for consolidated results and on a pre-tax basis for segment results. Consolidated adjusted income (loss) from operations is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income. See Exhibit 1 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted income from operations to shareholders' net income.2.Management is not able to provide a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to shareholders' net income (loss) or adjusted revenues to total revenues on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results (from equity method investments with respect to adjusted revenues) and (ii) future special items. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond Cigna's control. As such, any associated estimate and its impact on shareholders' net income and total revenues could vary materially. The Company's outlook excludes the potential effects of any other business combinations that may occur after the date of this earnings release. The Company's outlook includes the potential effects of expected future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends.As announced in January 2021, Cigna currently intends to pay regular quarterly dividends, with future declarations subject to approval by its Board of Directors and the Board's determination that the declaration of dividends remains in the best interests of Cigna and its shareholders. The decision of whether to pay future dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be based on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, the requirements of applicable law and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternate uses of capital. The share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, or privately negotiated transactions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.3.On July 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses in six countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand) to Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. (""Chubb"") for approximately $5.4 billion in cash (the ""Chubb transaction""). In December 2022, the Company divested its ownership interest in a joint venture in Türkiye.4.On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Texas Medicaid contracts to Molina Healthcare, Inc.5.Adjusted revenues is used by Cigna's management because it permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue. The Company defines adjusted revenues as total revenues excluding the following adjustments: special items and Cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. We exclude these items from this measure because management believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business. Adjusted revenues is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, total revenues. See Exhibit 1 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted revenues to total revenues.6.The divested international3 and Medicaid4 businesses had adjusted income from operations1, after-tax, of $1 million and $149 million in fourth quarter 2022 and fourth quarter 2021, respectively.

Adjusted SG&amp;A expense ratio for the full year 2021 represents enterprise selling, general and administrative expenses of $12,720 million excluding special items of $310 million as a percentage of adjusted revenue at a consolidated level.8.The measure ""adjusted effective tax rate"" is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, ""consolidated effective tax rate"". We define adjusted effective tax rate as the consolidated income tax rate applicable to the Company's pre-tax income excluding pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net realized investment results, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and special items. Cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Management is not able to provide a reconciliation to the consolidated effective tax rate on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof include (i) future net realized investment results and (ii) future special items.9.Customer relationships are defined as follows:•Total medical customers includes individuals in the Cigna Healthcare segment who meet any one of the following criteria: are covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement, or service agreement issued by Cigna; have access to Cigna's provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or have medical claims and services that are administered by Cigna.•Prior year lives include the Medicaid customers which were divested on January 1, 2022.•International Health medical customers excludes medical customers served by less than 100% owned subsidiaries.•Policies issued by the sold international life, accident, and supplemental benefits businesses3 and the joint venture in Türkiye3 have been excluded from customer relationships.10.Adjusted margin, pre-tax, is calculated by dividing adjusted income (loss) from operations, pre-tax by adjusted revenues for each segment.11.Cigna owns a 50% noncontrolling interest in its China joint venture. As such, the adjusted revenues for the Cigna Healthcare segment only include Cigna's 50% share of the joint venture's earnings reported in Fees and Other Revenues using the equity method of accounting under GAAP.12.Medical costs payable within the Cigna Healthcare segment are presented net of reinsurance and other recoverables. The gross medical costs payable balance was $4.18 billion as of December 31, 2022, $4.25 billion as of September 30, 2022, and $4.26 billion as of December 31, 2021.13.Cigna's outlook for full year 2023 includes the expected impacts of the FASB's new accounting for Long-Duration Insurance Contracts (""LDTI"") that is required to be adopted on January 1, 2023. The adoption of LDTI is not expected to result in a material restatement of Cigna's results in prior periods. CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release, and oral statements made in connection with this release, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

LRN, Herc Holdings Inc. HRI, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and Cigna Corp. CI.Add These 4 Stocks with Amazing Interest Coverage RatiosGiven the current scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Stride, Inc., Herc Holdings Inc., ONEOK, Inc. and Cigna Corp. are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesHere are four picks out of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Stride, a technology-based education company, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A.

Pfizer (PFE) is probably the only one in our coverage where it is still a significant part of it because it was their biggest business last year.""In fact, between Pfizer, Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY) this week — all of which had some COVID business— Pfizer is the only one that can still be evaluated on its pandemic business.""You kind of have to look at Pfizer as two different businesses. They have an ex-COVID business and the COVID business,"" Bansal told Yahoo Finance.But the company has been trying to pull the spotlight away from its COVID business, anticipating a decline in demand, and onto its broader pipeline, particularly as several blockbuster drugs will lose patent exclusivity in the next few years.Pfizer expects a loss of $17 billion from its pending patent cliff, but CEO Albert Bourla said on an earnings call this week that there are 19 products in the pipeline that will balance out that loss from its internal pipeline and external acquisitions. Pfizer also projected a decrease in sales of both the vaccine, Comirnaty, and its treatment, Paxlovid.Merck, meanwhile, has struggled with its COVID-19 business from the start. It failed to launch a vaccine, and its treatment, molnupiravir, has been a last resort for doctors. A recent study hasn't helped. The treatment has been linked to mutations of the virus — though none have been lethal or immune-evasive.Still, its drug is being considered for use in China, and the U.S. is removing requirements of a COVID positive test in order to get access to the treatments, which could open up the market for the drug. In addition, the company has been producing COVID-19 vaccines for Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which is also winding down its Covid business.Story continuesBut Merck is also facing a patent cliff for its biggest blockbuster, cancer drug Keytruda, even as it is expecting a reformulation to extend the patent.Meanwhile, Eli Lilly had a successful run with its COVID-19 monoclonal antibody, but the company recently took a hit on sales as the treatment is no longer effective against the latest variants. Its share of the COVID business is smaller, though.Bansal noted that he had even forgotten about the antibody.""Lilly is a really good growth story. ... I think today's weakness has less to do with the numbers, per se, and more to do with some rotation out of biotech and pharma,"" he said.""Overall, COVID is pretty much going to be zero for them this year, and I don't think investors even think about (Eli Lilly's) COVID business,"" Bansal added.The only other major COVID players, Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX), are expected to report earnings and 2023 outlooks later this month. Both, along with Pfizer, face a shift to a commercial market for vaccines this year. The latter has struggled to gain traction in the U.S. and the government is no longer purchasing doses, the impact of which remains to be seen.Pfizer's Bourla previously told Yahoo Finance he doesn't expect ""that people will comply"" with booster recommendations.""Complacency will be getting in the way, so I see that volumes of people that will be getting the vaccines will be less,"" Bourla said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.82, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.71 and our estimate of $1.66 but was down from the $1.84 reported in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues of $11.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $11.1 billion but decreased 5% from the year-ago period due to generic competition for multiple myeloma (MM) drug, Revlimid and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by in-line products (primarily Opdivo) and new product portfolios (primarily Opdualag and Abecma).Shares are up in pre-market trading.The company’s shares have gained 14.3% in the past year against the industry's decline of 3.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly DetailsRevenues increased 5% to $7.9 billion in the United States. However, revenues were down 22% outside the country due to lower demand for Revlimid as a result of generic erosion.Revenues from in-line and new product portfolios increased 7% (12% when adjusted for foreign exchange impacts) to $8.9 billion.Total in-line product revenues came in at $8.3 billion, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for the same was $8.7 billion.  Within this segment, Eliquis’ sales increased 1% to $2.7 billion. Revenues in international markets were impacted by foreign exchange impacts and lower average net selling prices. We note that Bristol-Myers has a collaboration agreement with Pfizer PFE for Eliquis.The companies collaborated in 2007. Profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMY a sales-based fee.Sales of the immuno-oncology drug Opdivo, approved for multiple cancer indications, were up 11% year over year to $2.19 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate was pegged at $2.2 billion. The label expansion of the drug boosted sales, driven by newer metastatic and adjuvant indications, partially offset by declining second-line eligibility across tumors and increased competition.Story continuesAnother MM drug, Pomalyst, generated sales of $877 million, up 3% year over year.Sales of the rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, grew 6% to $913 million.The leukemia drug Sprycel raked in sales of $578 million, up 4% year over year.Melanoma drug Yervoy contributed $568 million to the top line, up 4%.New product portfolio revenues grew 83% to $645 million, driven by higher demand for Reblozyl (up 32% to $199 million), Abecma ($125 million), Opdualag ($104 million) and Zeposia ($79 million).However, Revlimid revenues declined 32% to $2.3 billion from the year-ago quarter due to lower demand as a result of generic erosion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same was $1.8 billion. Abraxane revenues declined 41% due to the entry of authorized generics.Adjusted research and development expenses were flat at $2.5 billion in the quarter. Adjusted marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4%. Gross margin fell to 77.9% from 80.3% in the quarter.2022 ResultsRevenues in 2022 came in at $46.1 billion compared to $46.4 billion in 2021 and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.9 billion. Earnings per share (adjusted) came in at $7.70, up from $7.16 in 2021 and topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.61.2023 GuidanceBristol-Myers expects adjusted earnings of $7.95-$8.25 per share in 2023. Revenues are anticipated to increase by approximately 2% at reported rates and approximately 2% excluding foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $7.90 per share on revenues of $47.1 billion. Revlimid sales are expected to be $6.5 billion.Our TakeBristol-Myers beat fourth-quarter estimates for earnings and revenues. Sales, however, declined year over year due to generic competition for Revlimid. Nevertheless, the approval of new drugs adds a new stream of revenues, which should boost growth in the coming quarters. Pipeline progress has been impressive and strategic collaborations will further expand the portfolio.Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector are Novo Nordisk NVO and Sanofi SNY, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Over the past 30 days, earnings estimates for NVO for 2023 have gained 15 cents to $4.18.

Drugmakers out with results as the companies try to explain their strategies in a post-COVID world. Joining us now, Mohit Bansal, Wells Fargo Managing Director of Biopharma Equity. And also with us is Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. So good to have you with us, Mohit.So we already saw what happened with Pfizer. What about other expectations for potentially some of these other companies as well who have had their pandemic-related medicines and treatments now forward-looking? What are you expecting in terms of guidance here?MOHIT BANSAL: Great. Thank you, Rachelle, for having me today. So like we saw with Pfizer as well, COVID is really highly uncertain for this year-- COVID is probably going to stay here, but the question is, what would be the testing rate? What would be the diagnosis rate? And how many people would actually go and get their COVID pills or vaccines?So because of that, I mean, I think most of the drugmakers-- I mean, Lilly has basically guided really-- guided for pretty much low expectations for this year. And Merck has also said only $1 billion in their COVID pill revenues. And Pfizer also brought down the expectation significantly.So overall, COVID is pretty much out of the models. Pfizer is probably the only one in our coverage where it is still significant part of it, because it was their-- it was their biggest business last year. But for rest of the companies, it is a smaller business now.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Mohit, it's Anjalee here. I know that Pfizer is a little bit in the rearview mirror right now, but I heard you on the call and I know that of the four companies we're looking at today, Pfizer is one of the three that really has a lot of pressure from COVID. And I've said that they're sort of back at square one compared to where they were in 2019 when Bourla first took over.Story continuesI mean, looking at what their quarters were, quarter-over-quarter absolutely blowout-- 80%, really high numbers in terms of operational growth. Now, they're looking at their pipeline and trying to figure out how to, number one, combat that loss of exclusivity, as well as sort of tempering expectations for the COVID products.But we do know that there is still demand there. What are you seeing in terms of-- what are your expectations in terms of this balance that's now going to be struck between the continued offsetting of revenue coming in from COVID versus the rest of the pipeline?MOHIT BANSAL: Right. So this is a great question. And the way we think about Pfizer, you kind of have to look at Pfizer as, like, two different businesses. They have an ex-COVID business, and the COVID business, because COVID is really uncertain here. So for COVID, they had more than $50 billion revenues last year.And that number is coming down to-- they guided for $13 billion or so for vaccine, $8 billion or so Paxlovid. So it's significantly declined. But the question is, how would it look like for a tail? Pfizer thinks that the tail could be bigger in terms of there could be vaccination rates improving in all over time, and the pricing could improve for vaccines.We think it could be a little bit of show-me story. We are modeling it to be a $6 billion sale, which is where most of the investors agree with. Pfizer's number could be in double-digit billion dollars or even higher there. So that's where the data is.But for the rest of the business, I think Pfizer has generated a ton of cash with the COVID business so they can actually go out and do more deals, which could help them offset some of the core business [INAUDIBLE] that are coming in 2025 and beyond. So that's how we see it.There is a tail for COVID, the question is how much it is. And then rest of the business-- can they offset the LOEs? It is, again, a show-me story. And that's the challenge of owning Pfizer right now.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: And talk to me about Lilly, because I know that diabetes drug, the myths that they got there. But we've also seen the excitement around the potential of it to be used as a weight loss drug. And so I wonder, what are we looking at in terms of this company also coming off of a two-company look with the COVID product, the monoclonal antibody, and then the rest of the pipeline. What are your thoughts about this new diabetes drug?MOHIT BANSAL: Right. So COVID is a significantly smaller part of Lilly's business versus Pfizer. I mean, I did not even remember that they had a COVID business until you mentioned it. That's how much people don't think about COVID for Lilly.Lilly is a really good growth story. And I mean, today, diabetes was a little bit weak-- or [INAUDIBLE] a little bit weak. But I think today's weakness has less to do with the numbers, per se, and more to do with some rotation out of biotech and pharma, given that we can see the NASDAQ is doing so well-- so probably rotation into the tech sector at this point probably.That's where we are heading. But, again, Lilly is one of the best growth stories in biopharma right now. However, the challenge is that you are paying for it. Multiples are clearly reflecting that. So that's why they really don't have a lot of room to miss.And when they came out a little bit lower on that consensus-- or, sorry, of course, consensus they came out a little bit lower, it hurt them a little bit more than others because this has been a high flyer for a while now. So that's why there is a rotation there. But overall, I mean, COVID is probably not-- COVID is pretty much going to be zero this year for them. And it is not-- and I don't think investors even think about COVID business.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Mohit, of course, I want to ask you about Merck. You do have an overweight rating for them. What do you like here? Obviously, a lot of disappointment at the moment, but then also looking forward, we know that they're going to be having some new product cycles coming up as well. What is giving you hope, at least for now, for Merck?MOHIT BANSAL: Right. So Merck, we like Merck because they have a base business with Keytruda, one of the biggest cancer drugs out there. And it's growing significantly. And it could become a $30 billion-plus product by the end of the decade.I think why we like it is because investors in general are concerned about Keytruda losing patent exclusivity in 2028 and beyond. And now, onus is on Merck to figure out pipeline so that they can offset that loss. And what we like about Merck is that they are working on it. They have cardiovascular pipeline. They acquired an asset from Axiron last year, or maybe a year and a half back.And that trial has worked out. They have an oral PCSK9 that can be combined with statins to provide 40% to 50% incremental cholesterol reduction. So that's a pill. So that could be a-- that could be a decent drug. So they have guided that in cardiovascular business, they can generate $10 billion revenues.And in oncology, [INAUDIBLE] they can generate another $10 billion product revenues. So you cannot eliminate-- you cannot completely offset Keytruda when it goes off patent, but then the Keytruda problem slower. So this will be an evolving story over time. And that's why we like the name.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We do appreciate you joining us with your insights-- Mohit Bansal there, Wells Fargo Managing Director of Biopharma Equity and Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Thank you both.]"

D’Amelio has served a total of 20 years in CFO roles, and he’s had more than 20 mentees that have gone on to CFO or CEO roles. Yes, 20. Now in his retirement, this month he started serving as “CFO-in-residence” and independent senior advisor for Deloitte’s U.S. CFO Program providing his strategic guidance on the finance function.I recently chatted with D’Amelio, who shared with me questions to ask yourself and test if you have what it takes to be a CFO.Have I been properly prepared?In Part 1 of our series, we talked about what degrees and skill sets a future CFO needs. And that includes leadership DNA, strong financial acumen, and strategic knowledge of industry trends, to name a few.Can I do the job, and do it well? “I'm one of those folks that’s never arrogant,” D’Amelio says. “But I'd like to think I have some confidence,"" he quipped. You have to be honest with yourself about what you think you can accomplish, he says. It’s also helpful to get feedback from people who’ve followed and supported your career throughout the years.Do I really want the job?“Before I became the CFO at Lucent Technologies, I really liked being the president of the business unit,” D’Amelio explains. “When I got asked about taking the CFO job, I had to ask myself, do I want to do this? I hit a fork in the road. Was I going to go back into finance and probably stay in finance? Or am I going to stay on an operational path in senior leadership?” He eventually decided to accept the role. “The CFO job is perpetually demanding,” D’Amelio explains. “And it takes some sacrifice. But, quite frankly, I loved every minute of being a CFO.""What would be some of the tailwinds and headwinds about the job I'm going into? When seeking a CFO role at your current company, a few tailwinds include knowing a lot of the people you’ll be working with, and familiarity with the value-drivers and culture of the company, D’Amelio says.Story continuesRegarding headwinds, he offered an example of his move from group president at Lucent, an operational role, to the CFO position. No one in the investment community, nor sell-side analysts and portfolio managers knew him, he says. “I only had minimal exposure to the board and very limited exposure to the audit committee,” he explains. “I didn't have any relationships with the banks or with the rating agencies.” At least he knew the executive leadership team because he grew up at the company, he says. But it took an essential skill set for D’Amelio to face these headwinds. “I think it's critical that CFOs are really good communicators,” he says.Also, collaboration across the company and keeping everyone on the same page were important for D’Amelio in his career. “I would just try to connect people to what they were doing every day, how it impacted our guidance, how it impacted our stock price,” he says.D’Amelio says the CFO role is evolving, but there are some things that stay the same. “If you were to say to me, Frank, pick one key metric when you first made CFO back in 2001,” he says. “And then ask me what one key metric was when I retired as a CFO in 2022, the key metric is still shareholder value. At Pfizer, on my watch, we created about $165 billion of value.”“Now, would I have liked to have been more technologically fluent when I first started as a CFO?” he says. “Of course, I would’ve. But I eventually did much better [in tech] because of the pandemic.” D’Amelio says CFOs, for sure, have had to become more strategic. “And, I think talent is becoming a more and more critical variable,” he says.For Part 5, the finale of our series, you'll hear advice from CFOs from across industries.

Whereas most transactions used to remain relatively private, things were set to officially change on Jan. 1, 2022. As of that date, payment apps were required by law to report business transactions of at least $600 to the Internal Revenue Service. However, on Dec. 23, 2022, the IRS announced that it was delaying the reporting for payment apps by a year and the previous thresholds of $20,000 and 200 transactions would apply for the 2023 tax filing season. For the 2024 tax filing season, however, all business transactions of at least $600 made during 2023 are required to be reported to the IRS.Experts: Here’s How Much You Should Have in Your Checking AccountRelated: 3 Ways Smart People Save Money When Filing Their TaxesSo, what does this mean for your taxes going forward if you are the recipient of these types of payments? Read on to know exactly how to handle your taxes when paid through Venmo, PayPal and others.Payments Made From FriendsThe good news is that nothing has changed in terms of receiving money from friends and family. For example, if you go out to a restaurant, pick up the tab and have your friends pay you back via PayPal, those payments are not reported to the IRS. In the past, some companies would make payments to vendors or clients while using the “payment to friends” mode, but that’s not how they should be labeled. True payments for work should be marked as business payments, with the sender deducting the payment as a business expense and the recipient labeling it as income on their tax return.Business PaymentsBusiness payments received via services like these must be reported to the IRS as income, even if they fall under the $600 threshold. Since some recipients were not properly reporting even larger amounts to the IRS, the law has now changed so that the payment processors themselves will report them to the IRS. If you had received such payments in the past, you should have reported them as income to the IRS and paid the appropriate taxes on them. But now, those who avoided declaring this income in the past are simply out of luck. The IRS now has a record of those payments and will match it to your return. In short, if you fail to report the income, the IRS will catch it, and you’ll be assessed fines and penalties — and perhaps even criminal charges in egregious cases of fraud.Story continuesTake Our Poll: What Are Your Financial Priorities in 2023?Schedule C of Form 1040If you receive payment for services via Venmo, PayPal or other processing services, you technically run your own business. As such, you’ll report this income on Schedule C of Form 1040. On the plus side, as this is declared business income, you’ll also be allowed to take deductions for business expenses off from this income. For example, if you work three hours a week serving as an English tutor for overseas adults, you may be able to write off the cost of your computer, headset or other communications equipment you need to perform that job. Of course, you should consult with your tax advisor to see exactly what is allowed and what is not. If you use a headset both for your side gig and your personal life, for example, you won’t be allowed to deduct the full cost of that equipment on your taxes.Self-Employment TaxOne of the downsides of working a side gig is that self-employment tax may be due on that income. As described above, although you may not think of yourself as a self-employed worker, the IRS requires you to file a tax return as such if your net earnings from this type of employment are more than $400. Self-employment tax is in addition to any ordinary income tax you may owe on your earnings and consists of contributions to both Social Security and Medicare. As an employee, you may have noticed this 7.65% tax on your earnings. What you may not know is that your employer pays the other half of your self-employment tax, which is an additional 7.65%. But if you’re self-employed, you’re technically both an employer and an employee, meaning you personally are required to pay both halves — or 15.3% total — on your net self-employment earnings, minus certain deductions.More From GOBankingRates7 Florida Cities That Could Be Headed For a Housing CrisisExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 20238 Steps To Improve Your Finances in One YearCynthia Measom contributed to the reporting for this article.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How To Handle Your Taxes When You’re Paid Through Venmo, PayPal and Others]"
267,572a1fa1-3cd6-35d4-b12f-278819bf1032,PYPL,2023-02-03,Paypal (PYPL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-pypl-reports-next-week-150103978.html,1675350063,STORY,"['PYPL', 'PYCR']","[Paypal (PYPL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology platform and digital payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.2%.Revenues are expected to be $7.39 billion, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.87% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paypal?For Paypal, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.57%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Paypal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paypal would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.08, delivering a surprise of +13.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paypal appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Software industry, Paycor HCM, Inc. (PYCR), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.06 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +20%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $127.4 million, up 23.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Paycor HCM, Inc. has been revised 8.1% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.44%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Paycor HCM, Inc. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend investing, and go directly to read 5 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right Now. On February 1, 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, which marked its eighth increase since March 2022. The continuous interest rate hikes have made investors anxious about the stock market’s future. According to Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in January, investors broadly gave a pessimistic view of the market. However, over half of the respondents showed an inclination toward cheaper value stocks, considering their outperformance over growth equities in 2022. In addition to this, companies that have proven track records of dividend growth also made it to investors’ choice.Value stocks showed their greatest performance last year against growth equities since 2000, as reported by Bloomberg. Analysts expect the trend of value investing to continue this year as higher interest rates put margin pressures on the technology sector. Moreover, last year’s selloff was the worst for tech stocks since 2008, so investors are moving toward defensive quality stocks to stay afloat during this period. In this regard, dividend stocks regained their appeal, with dividend payments reaching their record high in 2022. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, compared with $511.2 billion in 2021. The report also mentioned that 373 companies in the S&amp;P 500 raised their dividend through December 15, up from 353 in 2021. These results show that companies have the sufficient cash flow to fulfill their shareholder obligation smoothly.AbbVie Inc.

The bottom line came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.10 and surged from the year-earlier quarter’s earnings of $1.66 per ADS, backed by stronger commodity prices, higher LNG volumes and refining margins.Shell’s revenues of $101.2 billion were up from fourth-quarter 2021 sales of $90.2 billion.Meanwhile, Shell repurchased $4.5 billion of shares in the fourth quarter. The energy group also informed that it completed the $4 billion buyback program announced during the third quarter earnings release. Moreover, SHEL expects another $4 billion worth of repurchases for the first quarter. As promised, the oil major increased its dividend by 15%.Shell PLC Unsponsored ADR Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseShell PLC Unsponsored ADR Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseShell PLC Unsponsored ADR price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Shell PLC Unsponsored ADR Quote Inside Shell’s SegmentsUpstream: The segment recorded a profit of $3.1 billion (excluding items) during the quarter, up from $2.8 billion (adjusted) in the year-ago period. This primarily reflects the impact of higher oil and gas prices, partly offset by lower volumes.At $82.42 per barrel, the group’s worldwide realized liquids prices were 12.1% above the year-earlier levels, while natural gas prices improved 37.6%.Shell’s upstream volumes averaged 1,859 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d), down 11.9% from the year-ago period, mainly due to the loss of contribution due to the company’s asset sales, to go with maintenance downtime. Liquids production totaled 1,331 thousand barrels per day (down 8.6% year over year) and natural gas output came in at 3,067 million standard cubic feet per day (down 19.3%).Chemicals and Products: In this segment, the London-based super-major reported an adjusted income of $744 million, turning around from a loss of $130 million in the year-ago period. The highly favorable comparison was due to strong refining margins and favorable deferred tax movements, which more than offset high depreciation charges and weakness in trading and optimisation. Meanwhile, refinery utilization came in at 90%, jumping from 68% during the December-end quarter of 2021.Integrated Gas: The unit reported an adjusted income of $6 billion, surging from $4 billion in the October-December quarter of 2021. Results were primarily impacted by higher LNG sales volumes, which edged up 0.6% from the third quarter of 2021 to 16.82 million tons. However, total Integrated Gas production fell 6.2% year over year to 917 MBOE/d.Marketing: The segment recorded an income of $446 million (excluding items) during the quarter compared to the year-ago earnings of $611 million due to a dip in margins.Renewables and Energy Solutions: The segment logged an adjusted income of $293 million, skyrocketing around from the year-ago profit of just $43 million. The performance boost reflects higher trading and optimization margins for gas and power in Europe. Moreover, external power sales were up 11.9% year over year to 66 terawatt hours, though piped gas sales fell 3.2% to 241 terawatt hours.Story continuesFinancial PerformanceAs of Dec 31, 2022, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had $40.2 billion in cash and $83.8 billion in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization was approximately 18.9%, down from 23.1% a year ago.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $22.4 billion, returned $1.8 billion to its shareholders through dividends and spent $6.4 billion on capital projects.The company’s cash flow from operations almost tripled from the year-earlier level. Meanwhile, the group raked in $15.5 billion in free cash flow during the fourth quarter compared to $10.7 billion a year ago.GuidanceShell expects first-quarter 2023 upstream volumes of 1,750-1,950 MBOE/d, while Integrated Gas production is expected between 910 MBOE/d and 970 MBOE/d. The company also foresees marketing sales volumes of 2,150-2,650 thousand barrels per day and refinery utilization in the range of 87-95% was also guided.Important Energy Releases So FarLet’s take a look at some key energy releases so far.SLB SLB, the largest oilfield contractor, announced fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of 71 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. SLB recorded total revenues of $7.9 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%.SLB’s strong quarterly earnings resulted from strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America. The company’s board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share, indicating a 43% increase from the last paid dividend.US energy powerhouse Chevron CVX reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $4.09, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.16. The underperformance could be attributed to lower-than-expected bottom line in both the company’s segments. CVX’s upstream segment profit of $5.5 billion came 19.8% below the consensus mark, while the downstream business missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%.The company recorded $12.5 billion in cash flow from operations, compared to $9.5 billion a year ago. The increasing cash flow could be attributed to strong price realizations in the upstream business. Importantly, Chevron’s free cash flow for the quarter was $8.7 billion. Further, Chevron paid $2.7 billion in dividends and bought back $3.8 billion worth of its shares.  Refining giant Marathon Petroleum MPC reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 and compared with a profit of merely $1.30 per share in the year-ago period. MPC’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $3.9 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38%.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $849 million on capital programs (59% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $651 million in the year-ago period.

Ford said in its earnings release that potential headwinds it sees include ""a mild recession in the U.S. and moderate recession in Europe; higher industrywide customer incentives, as vehicle supply-and-demand rebalances; a lower profit from Ford Credit.""On the flipside, Ford said it sees potential tailwinds like ""supply chain improvements and higher industry volumes; launch of the all-new Super Duty truck; and lower costs of goods sold, including for materials, commodities, logistics and other parts of the industrial platform.""This story is developing.The 40 millionth Ford Motor F-series pickup truck is displayed for a photo op next to a first-generation Ford F-1 at the Dearborn Truck Plant in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S., January 26, 2022.

Expectations are high for Ford ahead of earnings, which report after the bell. We just heard from General Motors earlier this week. The company handily beat Wall Street expectations, said it has no plans to cut prices on its electric vehicles yet.So what lies down the road for the auto industry? Let's talk about that with Edmunds Executive Director of Insights Jessica Caldwell.Jessica, nice to see you. Ford out with their sales numbers. Down 18.4% from the prior month. Now, January is usually a rough month for auto sales, but does that tell you, perhaps, that 2022 dynamic has changed this year?JESSICA CALDWELL: I don't think so. December is generally the best month for auto sales. January is usually the worst. So I would never really compare those two. And I think that for 2023, inventory is still going to be the name of the game. As that increases, sales should get better. Because they are very limited. I mean, we're still-- although, recovering and have been for several months now-- still very much down from what we would consider at a normal pace for inventory.SEANA SMITH: Earlier today, Cathie Wood was on Yahoo Finance. We know, obviously, she's a long time believer in Tesla. We asked her about the recent price cuts. I want to play a quick bite from her and then get your reaction.CATHIE WOOD: I think traditional auto manufacturers are going to have trouble keeping up with the price declines that Tesla's technology is enabling.SEANA SMITH: Do you agree with that?JESSICA CALDWELL: I mean, I think, right now, that probably is the case. Tesla is still almost 60% of all new EVs sold. So, in any event, they're going to be something big to contend with.As time goes on and more of these automakers are introducing EVs, especially if we do not get some updates from Tesla, having a Tesla is no longer the latest and greatest thing, and there'll be more out there in the market, more to compare it with. Someone else is going to come along and be the cool new person on the block. And that really appeals to early adopters. So while I think they are obviously a big force to deal with in this market, things are changing.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: GM, really, as we said, took a pass on following in those price cuts. Do you think those price cuts from Tesla will spread throughout the industry, or others will more follow GM's lead?JESSICA CALDWELL: I don't think so. I mean, I think price war is a real sexy thing to say. However, there's just not inventory to have a price war. I mean, if we look at what General Motors has, there's really not a lot there. There's a Bolt. There's a Hummer. And what they have coming this year that is even in the realm of competing with the Tesla Model Y, it's new, and it's probably gonna be limited by inventory. So I don't think that even-- price cut probably doesn't even need to be addressed there.I think Ford, the Mustang Mach-E being a natural competitor-- something that's been in the market for a little while-- to the Model Y, I could see why that would make sense. But even those price cuts were not necessarily very dramatic across the board. There were a few trim levels. But I do think that automakers will be looking at their pricing strategies and making sure that they could come in-- or have some models if possible to come in within the federal tax credit limits.SEANA SMITH: Jessica, what are you seeing in terms of traffic on Edmunds? We just had a few numbers up there, but, overall, after the price cuts from Tesla, how much did some of that interest, did that demand spike on your site?JESSICA CALDWELL: It definitely spoke-- it definitely spiked a lot. I think whenever you have someone like Tesla-- and the thing about Tesla's announcement was that it was very atypical in the sense that incentives are usually very targeted. When they come out and you say something like 20% for every vehicle, every region, that applies to everyone out there versus a specific location, a specific vehicle, a specific trim level, which is very different. So we saw the traffic pretty much double in terms of Tesla's share on our site as people were thinking, wow, maybe now is time to get a good deal. Let me research that.DAVE BRIGGS: As people do begin to look for new models in particular in the EV space, you have some advice before they begin that process. What is it, Jessica?JESSICA CALDWELL: Well, I mean, I think pricing obviously is a big one. Do the vehicles fall within these price limits? Because we do know that in March, the IRS is likely to issue guidance on mineral components, battery components, and that could change up that strategy. So if you are in the market in the short term, I think you really have to think about what's out there. Can you still get that credit? And I think that that would be really important.Another thing to keep in mind is really interest rates. Those are going up. In the fourth quarter, people were paying-- I mean, we're closing in on a 7% interest rate on new car loans, which is obviously crazy because they've not been that high in quite some time. And you really have to factor that in when you are considering that most vehicles, at this point in time, are-- they're transacting at over $40,000. So a lot of money we're talking about now.SEANA SMITH: Jessica, if you're one of those Tesla owners, you're a little bit upset because you bought before the price cuts. What's your advice to those people? Should they hold on to their Teslas?JESSICA CALDWELL: Well, I think that used values, of course, it doesn't feel good for that to happen, but it's only going to affect you if you want to sell it soon. So all those people that were thinking, let me buy this vehicle and flip it, which we saw a lot last summer when used values were just going off the charts, hopefully people are not doing that come December.But if you are one of those people that just bought a Tesla, if you're going to drive it for many years and keep it for a long time, these price cuts shouldn't affect you too much. It's just I think if you were going to sell it in the short term, that probably wouldn't be a great idea. So keep and hold I know doesn't sound as fun, especially as these people generally want something probably every-- in a faster cycle than the norm, but I think that probably would be the best way to mitigate these price cuts.DAVE BRIGGS: Jessica Caldwell from Edmunds, thanks so much.]"

The ads focus on the GM EV's as they drive through various Netflix shows, such as ""Stranger Things,"" ""Love is Blind,"" and this one, a ""Squid Game"" themed teaser, rolled out today.- We all wear masks. Does that resonate with you?DAVE BRIGGS: Yes, it does. Terrific ad. GM will run a 60 second Super Bowl ad that, based on publicized rates, would cost between 12 and 14 million, just for the one ad. This is the beginning of a partnership that should see more GM EVs popping up in Netflix original series.The streamer had already committed in '22 to put at least one electric vehicle in every series or movie it directly produced. GM shares surged on a strong earnings report this week. Another big move to the upside today, up almost 5%. And it is just rocking this year. And today, we'll get Ford earnings after the break and break those down. But it should be an interesting team up collaboration in that Super Bowl ad. I think a terrific idea.SEANA SMITH: It is a terrific idea. And GM needs to do something, right, just in terms of wider adoption of EVs. We know automakers, they long have wanted to place their vehicles in hit shows, in hit movies. So this makes sense on GM's part because when you take a look at some of their lofty goals here, they're planning to introduce 30 new EVs by 2025. So they need more of that wider adoption there. When you take a look at the sales of EVs, yes, they are increasing, but still less than 6% of the total market share.JOSH SCHAFER: Right, and the Super Bowl is a great time to do it, right? You're going to get a massive audience. Obviously, the ads are expensive. We're going to talk about that a lot over the next week. But you really do get different people to see your vehicle and I think realize sometimes that GM is making EVs, Ford is making EVs. I think a lot of the general consumer is still focused on Tesla, to some extent, when we talk about EVs.DAVE BRIGGS: Great point.]"

Lithium, with its exceptional energy density and the ability to withstand repeated charging and discharging, is the core material of lithium-ion batteries used in EVs. The lithium extracted and processed from this development project can lead to the production of up to one million EVs per year.With this announcement, GM is set to lead the pack by making the largest-ever investment made by an auto manufacturer in the production of battery raw materials. GM is investing a total of $650 million in Lithium Americas. The investment will provide GM with exclusive access to phase one of lithium production and the right to make the first offer for phase two of lithium production. The lithium production at Thacker Pass is expected to begin in the second half of 2026.According to Marry Barra, Chairperson and CEO of GM, the company has access to all the battery material it needs to reach its target of building more than 1 million battery-operated vehicles annually in North America in 2025. For future production, they will rely on raw materials sourced from domestic sites, like the one in Nevada. Sourcing raw materials and components from domestic suppliers and free-trade agreement countries would ensure an unswerving supply chain and help them manage cell costs. Barra affirms that the company is on track to meet its goal of producing 400,000 EVs in North America from 2022 through mid-2023.GM's total sum of $650M investment will be paid in two portions. The first chunk of the payment is to be held in escrow until the outcome of the Record of Decision ruling, currently pending in the U.S. District Court, meets the conditions. The second payment is expected after the separation of Lithium Americas U.S. and Argentina businesses and when Lithium America will have sufficient funds to develop the Thacker Pass.General Motors’ big push toward EVs is commendable. The automaker plans to roll out 30 new EV models by 2025-end. GM’s battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are likely to scale up its e-mobility prowess. The BrightDrop venture, designed to offer an integrated ecosystem of electric first-to-last-mile products, is set to boost prospects. The launch of Ultium Charge 360, aimed at improving the charging experience, also bodes well. Besides the Ultium platform, which is set to rev up its electrification capabilities, GM’s Ultifi platform seeks to enable the firm to achieve leadership in software and services.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGeneral Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the auto space include Mercedes-Benz Group AG MBGAF and Wabash National WNC.

Instead, they may be more of a problem for automakers trying to close the gap, she contended.""I think traditional auto manufacturers are going to have trouble keeping up with the price declines that Tesla's technology is enabling,"" the ARK Invest founder said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).Wood believes the price cuts stem from Tesla's cost leadership position in battery technology.

REUTERS/David SwansonElon Musk ""absolutely chose the right technology, and I think others are rethinking it now,"" Wood said. “If they do not switch over to this kind of battery technology, they will not be able to catch up with Tesla in terms of price declines without losing money — whereas Tesla’s gross margins are probably going to continue moving up on balance, even as it is cutting prices because its unit volumes, the economies of scale, are going to be so significant.""In early January, Tesla cut the Model 3 base version by $3,000 to $43,990. The Model 3 Performance variant saw a price cut of $9,000 to $53,990.Tesla also dropped the price for the Model Y Long Range by $13,000 to $52,990 while the Performance model was cut to $56,990, about $13,000 cheaper than the prior price.EV rival Ford (F) followed with price cuts of its own to better compete with Tesla. Though GM's (GM) CFO Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance this week that he has no plans to cut prices for EVs.To Wood's point, the price cuts appear to have led to renewed demand (and perhaps market share gains) for Tesla, as CEO Elon Musk hinted at in the company's latest earnings call.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.But not everyone on Wall Street shares Wood's optimism on Tesla.Many pros think price cuts will prove to be damaging to the Tesla brand over the long term while at the same time hurting profit margins.Story continues""Based on the statement that [Elon Musk] made on the fourth quarter earnings call, saying that his demand is 2x his supply, you'd be silly to cut price,"" BofA analyst John Murphy said on Yahoo Finance Live.

That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesGoing beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.LCNB (LCNB) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.21 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.54%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.5% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.57%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5%. Check LCNB (LCNB) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is paying out a dividend of $1.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.64% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.11% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 20% over the past year. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.22 per share, Tanger Factory Outlet (SKT) has a dividend yield of 4.52%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 4.22% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 20.55%. Check Tanger Factory Outlet (SKT) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

287,134d01fa-7896-3259-986c-afc82ea3aefd,TGT,2023-02-03,Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 48% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporations-nyse-tgt-intrinsic-110050402.html,1675422050,STORY,['TGT'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Target What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$273.4mUS$3.79bUS$4.08bUS$4.60bUS$5.83bUS$6.65bUS$7.26bUS$7.77bUS$8.20bUS$8.57bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.15%Est @ 7.03%Est @ 5.54%Est @ 4.50% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% -US$255US$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.5kUS$4.1kUS$4.4kUS$4.5kUS$4.5kUS$4.4kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.1%) = US$173bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$173b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$87bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$123b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$181, the company appears quite undervalued at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Target as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.850. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TargetStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Multiline Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you have any additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.Owen Thomas: Thank you Helen and good morning everyone. Today I will cover BXP's continued strong operating performance as demonstrated in our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I'll discuss key economic and market trends impacting BXP and finish with BXP's capital allocation decisions and activities. Despite increasing economic headwinds, BXP continued to perform in the fourth quarter and had strong overall operating results throughout 2022. Our FFO per share this quarter was above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance. Our FFO per share grew 15% in 2022 due to development deliveries and strong leasing activity. We completed 1.1 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and 5.7 million square feet of leasing for all of 2022 which is 95% of our average annual leasing over the last 10 years.The weighted average term for leases signed in 2022 was 9.2 years. This success can again be attributed to not only BXP's strong client relationships and our team's execution, but also the increased share of tenant demand captured by premier workplaces, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio. BXP raised $1.2 billion in additional liquidity through a $750 million unsecured green bond offering and the extension and upsizing of a bank term loan ensuring funding for our sizable and substantially leased development pipeline in a challenging capital markets environment. And lastly on 2022, BXP continues to be a decorated industry leader in sustainability having most recently won Nareit's Leader in the Light Award named the highest ranking real estate company and 29th overall on Newsweek's list of Most Responsible Companies and one of only eight property companies named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.Notwithstanding the running debate on whether the U.S. economy will experience a hard or soft landing, commercial real estate markets are currently in a recession. Many of our clients are experiencing a slowdown in growth or reductions in top line revenue and as a result are focused on cost control including moderating headcount and space use. We all read the daily headlines of layoffs which have been most significant in the technology industry, but are migrating into other sectors. Many companies, particularly in the technology sector are halting new requirements and/or giving back space to the market. The key culprit for the current economic slowdown is inflation, which sparked unprecedented federal reserve tightening measures last year, including rapidly increasing interest rates, quantitative tightening measures, and more regulatory scrutiny of banks.The better news is inflation is starting to come down. The federal reserves is expected to moderate further interest rate increases with the Fed funds rate possibly peaking around 5% and the capital markets with a 10 year U.S. Treasury at 3.5% and rallying equity markets are much less hawkish on inflation than the Federal Reserve. We are not able to predict the depth or length of the current economic slowdown, but its trajectory is coming into clearer focus. Our goal is to position BXP for success regardless of the economy's trajectory by carefully managing leverage and liquidity. The leasing activity is declining due to corporate earnings pressure. The premier workplace segment of the office market continues to materially outperform. Users are increasingly interested in upgrading their buildings and workspaces to attract their workforce back to the office, resulting in an accelerating flight to quality in the office industry.As described previously, CBRE is tracking the performance of premier workplaces in the U.S. and for the five CBDs where BXP operates, premier workplaces represent approximately 17% of the 700 million square feet of space and less than 13% of the total buildings. As of yearend 2022, direct vacancy for premier workplaces was 9.6% versus 14.7% for the rest of the market, also for all of 2021 and 2022, net absorption for premier workplaces was a positive 7.1 million square feet versus a negative 25.4 million square feet for the balance of the market. Rents and rent growth are higher for Premier workplaces and we believe the segment captures well over half of all leasing activity. Including two buildings undergoing renovation 94% of BXP's CBD space is in buildings rated as premier workplaces, which has been and will be critical for our leasing success.Moving to real estate capital markets for office assets, U.S. transaction volume slowed materially to $12 billion in the fourth quarter down 40% from the third quarter. Transaction volume across all real estate classes was down 36% over the same period. Mortgage financing is very challenging to arrange and available for only the highest quality leased assets and sponsors. First mortgage financing costs have risen materially over the past year based on both higher rates and credit spreads. Given the dearth of transaction activity, office asset pricing is difficult to determine, but it is clear cap rates have risen. There were a handful of BXP comparable transactions of note in the quarter. In the Route 128 quarter of Boston, two separate lab sales were completed for a total of $375 million, one sold to a REIT and another to an institutional investor.So one of the transactions is a redevelopment pricing parameters indicate a stabilized yield of at least 6% and pricing per square foot in the mid-900s. In Sunnyvale, California, two separate and fully leased office complexes sold for $415 million, one to a private real estate company and the other to an international fund. Initial cap rates ranged from 4.8% to 6.2% and prices per square foot from 1140 to 1230 . Regarding BXP's capital market activity in the fourth quarter, we closed both the previously described acquisition of a 27% interest in 205th Avenue in New York City and the sale of The Avant, a luxury residential building in Reston. For all of 2022 we acquired $1.6 billion of lab and office assets and completed over $860 million of dispositions of office and residential assets.So we have additional asset sales in our targeted pipeline. Completion of the dispositions will require more liquid capital market conditions. New acquisitions will be opportunistic and solely focused on premier workplaces, life science and residential development. BXP's volumes for acquisitions and dispositions are very difficult to predict for 2023 given current market conditions. Our development pipeline continues to be active delivering growth to our current and future financial results. This past quarter we fully placed into service the 1.1 million square foot Reston Next premier workplace, which is 90% leased on a long-term basis to Fannie Mae and VW of America. This project was delivered below budget on costs and is projected to yield 7.7% upon stabilization.We also placed into service 880 Winter Street, a 244,000 square foot, very successful office to lab conversion project located in Waltham that is 97% leased. We purchased the office building in 2019 for $270 a square foot, spent approximately $500 a square foot on the conversion and delivered the project at an initial cash yield of 10%. We also commenced the conversion of 105 Carnegie Center, a 70,000 square foot suburban office building in our Carnegie Center asset in Princeton to lab use. This is our first attempt at Life Science at Carnegie Center and we have life science clients reviewing the opportunity. There are two projects, 290 and 300 Binney Street in Cambridge that do not appear on our fourth quarter construction and progress schedule that we are commencing in the first quarter and have an impact on our current 2023 financial projections, which Mike will discuss in greater detail.As described on our last call, Biogen is in the process of vacating the 300 Binney Street office building and we will commence the conversion of the asset to lab use for the Broad Institute, which has agreed to lease the building for 15 years. We have also completed the necessary pre-development hurdles to commence the development of 290 Binney Street, a 570,000 square foot 16 story lab building leased to AstraZeneca for 15 years. We estimate that the project will cost approximately $1.2 billion and expect it to be delivered in 2026 at an initial cash yield in the mid-6% range. Given the annual escalations in the AstraZeneca lease, the initial FFO yield is materially higher. 290 Binney Street is a complicated development entailing the demolition of a 1136 stall parking garage, the temporary relocation of parking capacity from this garage, the construction of a subterranean vault, which will house an electrical substation currently being permitted by Eversource and other facilitating agreements.Commencing 290 Binney Street also creates an obligation for BXP to build 121 Broadway, which is a 37-story, 4,440 unit residential tower which will likely commence in 2024. In addition to these two buildings, BXP also has remaining rights for an additional 580,000 square foot life science building in our Kendall Center development, which due to upfront infrastructure costs carried by the first two projects has the potential to be developed at significantly higher yields than 290 Binney Street. These projects demonstrate the skill of BXP's development team in identifying an opportunity to creatively solve a community problem of locating a new electrical substation and having the expertise to bring the project to reality by solving problems for multiple interested stakeholders, thus creating a highly accretive development opportunity for BXP.After all of these movements and including the 290 and 300 Binney Street projects, our current development pipeline of 13 office, lab and residential projects as well as View Boston, the observation deck at the Prudential Center aggregates approximately 4 million square feet and $3.3 billion of BXP investment that we project based on delivery date and lease up assumptions to add more than $240 million to our NOI over the next five years at a 7.3% average cash yield on cost when stabilized. The commercial component of our development pipeline is 51% pre-leased. So in summary, despite adverse market conditions, BXP had another very successful quarter and year with financial performance above expectations, strong FFO growth, significant leasing success and robust investment and capital reallocation activity.BXP is well positioned to weather the current economic slowdown given our premier workplace market positions, our strong and increasingly liquid balance sheet, our significant and well leased development portfolio in progress, and our potential to identify additional investment opportunities in the current market dislocation. Let me turn the discussion over to Doug.Douglas Linde: Thanks Owen. Good morning everybody. So Owen really spent some time describing the totality of what's going on at BXP. I'm going to be a little bit more concentrated today and talk about demand. Every day seems to bring another announcement of staff reduction from some large or medium sized employer. And while the cons -- these announcements have been concentrated in the technology industries, as Owen described, primarily big tech, we're also seeing them in the finance industry, the legal industry, and broader corporate America. Now I can point to examples of companies in our portfolio that are growing, but we are the first to acknowledge that the pool of clients overall demand that we serve is unlikely to be growing their overall footprint in 2023, aka hard to see much in the way of positive absorption.If there's a silver lining in the job reductions that are being announced, it's an improvement in the labor availability is manifesting itself in encouraging ways. Fewer job listings being offered for remote work. Forms of hybrid work seem to be sticky, but the power dynamic between employers and employees is shifting. Companies are stepping up the days that workers are asked, required, cajoled to come into the office. In our portfolio, we're seeing a steady increase in the number of unique occupants that are in the office each week. We measure the unique number of card swipes on a daily basis where we have turnstiles. These numbers vary day-to-day and if I compare the best day in March of 2022, which is after the last sort of COVID omicron surge versus the best day in January, so a week ago, across the BXP portfolio volume is up almost 40%.I don't know how others measure their usage. BXP measures against the number of seats we have in our spaces. On a daily basis utilization ranges from between 34% in San Francisco, 48% in Boston, and 58% in New York City. And if we look at the number of unique users coming into our buildings on a weekly basis relative to the number of seats, we're currently seeing as much as 82% in New York City, 76% in Boston, and 70% in San Francisco. Our clients are using their space, they're just not coming to the office every day. As Owen said, we've spent a better part of 18 months redefining our business with you as being developers and operators of premier workplaces. As Owen described in his comments, the bifurcation between premier product and general office space continues to widen.The availability rates published by the brokerage firms and reported as headlines in business publications and newspapers, track all of the space. A meaningful amount of the existing office inventory may have a higher and a better use as an alternative product and it's not relevant to users searching for space today. Conversions will happen and we are studying non-BXP buildings in our markets, but this process is going to take years. So the published statistics are going to be sticky even though much of the availability is not attractive to users at any price. In fact, it's hard to see a potential client looking at a BXP offering that would consider many of the buildings captured in the broad market surveys. Again, we have to acknowledge that there continues to be additions to of new sublet or soon to be direct opportunities in premier space from technology companies, 181 Fremont Street in San Francisco being the latest example.Availability in premier space matters, but other issues matter even more. The floor plate size matters. The build out configuration matters. Amenities matter. In markets like Boston or San Francisco, parking availability matters, and the specific location matters. As we explained in our press release last night, while our reported in-service occupancy has declined in the quarter as we said it would on our last call and in our Nareit meetings in November, it is simply due to the addition of new in-service buildings that have leases that have not commenced and are reported as vacant. This includes Reston Next that is 69% occupied and 90% leased and 880 Winter Street that's 85% occupied and 97% leased.CBD: The mark to market on the leases we signed this quarter were up 7% in Boston, 9% in San Francisco, flat in New York City and down 11% in DC. It should come as no surprise that we think BXP's premier workspace portfolio is highly differentiated, but on top of that, our operating teams are the best in the business. I want to describe three transactions we accomplished in the fourth quarter that illustrate our team's creativity. In Boston we were getting a 100,000 square feet block of space back in one of our assets. The team identified a client that typically does not do direct deals with landlords, but generally looks at sublet space. We engaged the principles in a tour of the space. The space was in great condition and we were able to secure a lease that met the tenant's desire to have an attractive annual rent as possible in a premier building with limited capital outlay and make a long-term commitment.The lease was executed in late December. In San Francisco a client with a fast approaching termination option in its existing non-DXP building wanted to move to View space. They toured the market in early in December and then identified two spaces in the 34% available market that met their needs. On December 26th, we signed a binding letter of intent. The client understood they were not taking any counterparty risk with BXP and we signed the lease for 50,000 square feet or two and a half floors that were vacant on January 16th. In October, our New York team identified a client that had a lease expiration and no ability to renew in place in mid-2023, which is a very tight timeline. We sent an unsolicited proposal for two vacant floors in our 53rd Street campus.With some persistence we were able to arrange a tour. We mobilized our construction department to deliver the space per their needs and in December we signed a lease for two vacant floors and an option for a third. Owen mentioned that we delivered our life science project at 880 Winter Street this quarter. We also completed our first lease at 651 Gateway. We have available space as well at our two developments in Waltham. The life science market is also experiencing a slowdown in demand. At the present time, we have not made any commitments to build additional projects other than 290 Binney Street, which is a 100% leases to AZ and the 70,000 square foot project that Owen described at Carnegie Center. It's a challenging market. There is not going to be positive market absorption in the near-term.We believe that BXP will outperform the market and we will lease our available space because our portfolio is fundamentally comprised of premier workspaces and the demand that is in the market wants to be in these types of properties. Medium and small financial and professional service clients will make up the bulk of the leasing we complete in 2023. We completed 72 leases during the fourth quarter. Only one lease was above a 100,000 square feet. Tour activity continues to be strongest in the Boston CBD and New York City markets where the concentration of technology users is less pronounced and the weighting market occupancy leans more heavily towards traditional, financial and professional services firms. Not surprisingly, the most active buildings in our portfolio are the GM building and 200 Clarendon.With that, I'll stop and turn the call over to Mike.Michael LaBelle: Great, thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. I plan to cover the details of our fourth quarter performance and the changes to our 2023 earnings guidance. However, I would like to start with a summary of our recent capital raising activities. We've been very busy in the capital markets and have substantially bolstered our liquidity heading into 2023. In the last 120 days, we've executed on three transactions in three different markets. We sold one of our residential buildings in Reston Town Center for $141 million and a 4.3% cap rate. We issued $750 million of five-year unsecured green bonds, and in January we extended and upsized our corporate unsecured term loan to $1.2 billion, an increase of $470 million. In aggregate, the net proceeds raised from these deals is $1.35 billion and we now have liquidity of $2.6 billion, which puts us in an extremely strong position to complete our development pipeline, including our recently commenced 570,000 square foot fully pre-leased, 290 Binney Street Life science project, as well as provide additional capital for other opportunities that may arise.We've also reduced our 2023 loan maturity exposure to $930 million, which is comprised of $500 million of senior unsecured notes that expired in September and five expiring mortgages totaling $430 million at our share. The majority of these mortgages have embedded extension options and we anticipate renewing or refinancing all of these facilities. Given the challenging state of the current debt markets, particularly with respect to the mortgage markets, we are very well positioned. Now I'd like to turn to our fourth quarter earnings results. We reported fourth quarter FFO of $1.86 per diluted share and full year 2022 FFO of $7.53 per diluted share. This is a penny ahead of the midpoint of our guidance and $0.02 cents ahead of street consensus.ArkansasSTUDIO GRAND OUEST/Shutterstock.comThe improvement was primarily from better performance in our portfolio with our NOI of about $4 million or $0.02 per share ahead of our forecast. The outperformance was a mix of higher lease revenue, stronger results from our hotel in Cambridge and higher building service income, especially in New York City where we see the highest space utilization. The portfolio outperformance was partially offset by a penny of higher net interest expense related to our $750 million green bond offering that was not part of our original guidance. Although not part of FFO I do want to describe that we took a $51 million or $0.29 per share non-cash impairment charge in the quarter, reducing the book value of our equity interest in our Dock 72 property located in Brooklyn, New York.This building is owned in a joint venture where we hold 50%. The building has suffered from weekly leasing conditions in Brooklyn and last quarter the primary client contracted by two floors. It's currently just 25% occupied, although it is 42% leased, including leases that have not yet commenced. Overall, we had a strong year in 2022. We increased revenue by 8% and our FFO by 15% over 2021. Our growth came from our same property portfolio as well as our developments and our acquisitions. Our same property NOI increased 4% over 2021, which was the high end of our range, and on a cash basis it was even stronger with cash NOI growth in our same property portfolio of 6.5% over 2021. Our development deliveries added $0.24 per share to our 2022 earnings and our acquisitions net of our dispositions added $0.10 per share.Now I'd like to turn to an update to our 2023 guidance. As we detailed in our press release, the two most significant changes to our 2023 FFO guidance are the impact of commencing our 290 Binney Street development and the interest expense associated with our new financings. We did not incorporate 290 Binney in our guidance last quarter due to several significant contingencies we needed to clear prior to starting the projects that were outside of our control. Our team successfully closed out these items late in the fourth quarter and we were able to start the project in January. The development plan includes closing and demolishing the existing Binney Street garage. That garage produced $8.6 million of NOI in 2022, and we will lose this income in 2023 and going forward until the completion of the development, which will include a new underground parking facility.As Owen described, the project is projected to be highly accretive to our future FFO, and by the way, all the lost garage income is incorporated into those development returns. We are also required by GAAP to expense the garage demolition costs of approximately $3.2 million. We expect to incur the demolition expense in the first and second quarters of 2023 with no impact thereafter as the demolition will be complete. These two items related to 290 Binney Street will result in $11.8 million of lower FFO in 2023 or $0.07 per share. With respect to our financing activity, we disclosed in our press release in November that our $750 million green bond offering would add $0.08 per share to our 2023 net interest expense and reduce our FFO guidance.As a result, we expect the aggregate impact of starting 290 Binney and issuing incremental debt capital will reduce our 2023 FFO by $0.15 per share. Despite this, our new guidance range for diluted FFO of $7.8, to $7.18 per share is a reduction of only $0.09 per share at the midpoint from our guidance last quarter. That means we've increased the projected contribution to FFO from other areas. Also, we previously communicated the impact of our bond offering, so the reduction is really only a penny per share from our November adjusted guidance. The projected increases come from three places; first, excluding 290 Binney Street, our assumption for incremental contribution to NOI from acquisitions and development is up $0.02 per share. The increase is from higher contribution from our 205th Avenue acquisition and better than projected leasing in our development pipeline.Doug described the increased leasing this quarter in the pipeline and some of that will generate revenues in 2023. Second our revised assumption for net interest expenses are lower by $0.03 per share net of the impact of the bond offering, and this improvement is primarily from higher earnings on our cash balances and higher capitalized interest from changes in our development spend and higher interest capitalization rate. And last, we've increased our guidance for development and management services income by $2 million or a penny per share, reflecting higher projected construction management fees. So to summarize, we've modified our 2023 guidance range for diluted FFO to $7.8, to $7.18 per share, a decline of $0.09 per share at the midpoint.The changes are the result of costs from starting 290 Binney Street of $0.07 and higher interest expense from our bond offering of $0.08. And these reductions are partially offset by higher contributions to NOI from acquisitions and developments of $0.02 cents, higher interest income and capitalized interest of $0.03 and higher fee income of a penny. Our 2023 forecast result in a projected reduction in FFO of 5% from last year after growing 15% in 2022. The reduction is wholly due to the significant increase in interest rates as our portfolio NOI continues to grow and we have a significant pipeline of accretive developments that are delivering over the next few years. As Owen described, it appears that we are close to the end of the Fed's tightening cycle, so interest rates should not be the same headwind going forward.The last thing I would like to mention is that we intend to change the timing of our initial issuance of annual guidance starting next year. We plan to provide guidance for 2024 with our fourth quarter earnings release similar to the other companies in our sector. That completes all of our formal remarks.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quartaro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Rob Quartaro: Good morning and thank you for joining our first fiscal quarter 2023 earnings call. We issued our press release this morning and posted the accompanying presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the application you're using to view this webcast. With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, David Sewell and our Chief Financial Officer, Alex Pease. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for a question-and-answer session. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, projections, estimates, and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of assumptions, risks, and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discussed during the call.We describe these assumptions, risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for fiscal year ended September 30th, 2022. We will also be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. As mentioned previously, the slide presentation is available on our website. With that, I'll now turn it over to you, David.David Sewell: Thank you, Rob and thank you all for joining our earnings call today. This morning, I'll provide an overview of our fiscal first quarter results, followed by a review of our strategy, and progress on our transformation. Then I'll turn it over to Alex, who will review our segment performance in more detail review our adjusted free cash flow, and provide our outlook for the fiscal second quarter. We will then move to Q&amp;A. Turning to our first quarter results on slide three. Net sales were comparable to prior year at $4.9 billion and consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined 4% to $652 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.55, a decrease of 15% compared to the prior year quarter, and the company generated $30 million of adjusted free cash flow.Story continuesIt's important to note that consolidated adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $119 million due to economic downtime and weather disruptions. Pension and foreign exchange rates also negatively impacted our year-over-year consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth by $57 million combined. As we anticipated, the first quarter operating environment saw continued inventory rebalancing, elevated inflation, and shifting consumer spending. These trends primarily impacted external containerboard demand as well as our Corrugated Packaging segment. However, Corrugated Packaging improved quarter-over-quarter with North American packaging shipments up 2% and to 373 million square feet per day. We continue to balance our supply with our customers' demand, and we incurred 356,000 tons of economic downtime during the quarter.Our Consumer Packaging business and external paperboard continue to see consistent demand supported by exposure to several resilient end markets and adoption of our plastics replacement solutions. During the quarter, our consumer business was negatively impacted by weather disruptions and other items in several of our mills. However, we continue to see healthy demand and backlogs. The resiliency of our consumer business illustrates the benefit of our diversified business model and differentiates us in the market. Longer term, it also positions us well to capture more share of wallet as we are the only paper and packaging company able to offer a full range of packaging solutions, including machinery and automation. Corrugated Packaging adjusted EBITDA margins, excluding trade sales, were 14.2%, an increase of 70 basis points.Consumer Packaging adjusted EBITDA margins were 15.1%, an increase of 20 basis points. Both Corrugated and Consumer margins benefited from strong year-over-year pricing. We are continuing to implement previously published price increases in our consumer business, which should continue for several more months. Global paper margins declined 320 basis points to 14% as inventory rebalancing and softer demand pressured results. Distribution adjusted EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points to 3.4%, primarily driven by favorable selling price and mix. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.35 times, slightly above our targeted range of 1.75 times to 2.25 times. We intend to use proceeds from the expected sale of our stake in RTS and our Chattanooga Mill as well as our free cash flow to return leverage to our targeted range over time.We remain focused on executing our transformation and striving toward the goals we outlined in our Investor Day last May, recognizing the uncertain macroeconomic environment. We see significant opportunity to drive productivity, increase our margins and improve our return on invested capital. We will continue to leverage our robust cash flow to invest in growth, manage our leverage and return capital to shareholders. Before moving to an update on our transformation initiatives, I'd like to highlight that for the third consecutive year, WestRock was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in recognition of our commitment to sustainable business practices. The index recognizes the top 20% of sustainability performance among the 600 largest US and Canadian companies.Sustainability is core to what we do at WestRock, and we're proud to be recognized for our efforts. And I'd like to thank our 58,000 team members for living our values in everything they do. Turning to Slide 4. Last May, we communicated the four key pillars of our transformation strategy, and we continue to make progress in each of these areas. First, leveraging the power of One WestRock. Given WestRock's broad capabilities and scale, we are uniquely positioned to deliver value to our customers and serve their packaging needs. An ongoing example of this is our relationship with Molson Coors. Through our partnership, Molson Coors is replacing their use of plastic rings with our cluster pack packaging and automation solution. Molson Coors estimates this solution will eliminate over 1.7 million pounds of plastic waste annually by 2025.The complementary relationship between our machinery business and packaging serves our customers well, creates deeper relationships, and drives organic growth. We now have over 5,100 machines in our installed base and it continues to grow. We see strong demand for our machinery solutions with backlogs of 12 months as of the end of the quarter. Our next pillar is innovating with a focus on sustainability and growth. We are investing in innovative solutions to help our customers meet their sustainability targets and displace plastic packaging with more than 225 innovation projects in development. More than 30 of those projects are related to plastics replacements. Our plastics replacement revenue continues to grow and is currently estimated at a $365 million run rate and we are targeting increasing that to more than $700 million in run rate revenue by fiscal 2025.Packaging, Box, PackagePhoto by Mak on UnsplashOur third pillar is relentless focus on margin improvement and increasing efficiency. We are executing on our productivity initiatives and we are on track to achieve $250 million in cost savings in fiscal 2023. These initiatives are driving savings through logistics and planning optimization, centralized procurement, SG&amp;A reductions, and efficiencies in our mill and converting network. We continue to see significant cost-saving opportunities beyond fiscal 2023 and we remain focused on unlocking these savings to expand our margins. And finally, executing disciplined capital allocation. We remain focused on using our cash flow to drive value through our disciplined capital deployment strategy. Last year, we invested more than $860 million to maintain and improve our assets.We've increased our dividend over 37% in the last seven quarters, while also repurchasing more than $700 million of our stock. We are also continuing to refine our portfolio to focus on the most attractive markets, reduce volatility, and improve our return on invested capital. Last year, we permanently shut capacity in higher-cost facilities in Panama City and St. Paul, enabling us to redirect significant capital investment toward better use in other assets. In December, we closed on the sale of two non-core URB mills and we continue to work toward closing on the sale of our stake in RTS and our Chattanooga mill, which remains subject to regulatory approval. We also recently completed our Grupo Gondi acquisition, which complements our North American footprint and increases our exposure to the attractive Latin America market.The IMF projects the strategically important market will grow more than 50% faster than the United States, driven by economic growth and export product expansion in produce, protein, and industrial goods. In addition to attractive financial returns, Grupo Gondi's high-quality assets bring us closer to many of our large multinational customers operating in the region. Grupo Gondi is already contributing to our growth, with adjusted EBITDA of $17 million since the acquisition closed in December and its full year results were in line with expectations. The results for Grupo Gondi are included in other unallocated this quarter given the timing of the closing and we are near finalizing how we will report it longer term. I'll now turn it over to Alex to discuss our segment results in more detail.Alex Pease: Thank, David. Moving to our consolidated quarterly results on Slide 5. The first quarter net sales were roughly flat year-over-year at $4.9 billion, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined 4% to $652 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.2%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. Price and mix positively contributed approximately $454 million year-over-year. This benefit was offset by cost inflation, lower volumes and higher operating costs. Note, consolidated adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $119 million due to economic downtime and weather disruptions, which impacted our volumes and operating costs. Pension and foreign exchange rates also negatively impacted our year-over-year consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth by $57 million combined.Turning to Slide 6. Corrugated Packaging segment sales, excluding trade sales were $2.2 billion, an increase of $26 million or 1% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased $20 million or 7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding trade sales, increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 14.2%. As David mentioned, we saw 2% improvement quarter-over-quarter with per shipping day volumes of 373 million square feet. Strong pricing and mix contributed $206 million, largely offset by $79 million of inflation, $58 million from lower volumes and $39 million from higher operating costs. Results were negatively impacted by $60 million due to economic downtime and weather disruptions during the quarter. We are managing our business for current conditions, and we'll continue to balance our production with our customers' demand.Turning to the Consumer Packaging business on Slide 7. Segment sales increased $76 million or 7% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased $14 million or 8%, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.1%, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. Strong price and mix contributed $132 million, partially offset by inflation of $54 million and higher operating costs of $34 million. Consumer packaging demand remains strong and backlogs are healthy. This diversification from our consumer business reduces earnings volatility and provides attractive long-term growth opportunities. Turning to Slide 8. Global Paper segment sales decreased $229 million or 17% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA declined 32% to $157 million with adjusted EBITDA margin declining 320 basis points to 14%.While adjusted EBITDA declined year-over-year, it was 4% above the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Strong price and mix contributed $115 million, more than offset by volume of $114 million and inflation of $48 million. Note that adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $56 million due to economic downtime and weather disruptions. We saw weaker demand for containerboard and more resilient demand for paperboard during the quarter. Export containerboard declined 65%, while domestic containerboard declined 33%. In the current environment, we are continuing to prioritize margin over volume in our Global Paper segment. Longer-term, demand for our external containerboard business should benefit from the limited supply of virgin fiber globally.I'd like to mention that we will face a difficult year-over-year comparison in the second quarter, as Global Paper revenue increased 36% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Next, our distribution results are on slide nine. Segment sales decreased 1% year-over-year to $322 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 66% year-over-year. Strong price and mix contributed $20 million, partially offset by inflation of $13 million and volume of $3 million. In the quarter, favorable selling price and mix contributed to the 140 basis points of margin expansion. Looking to the second quarter, our distribution business also faces a difficult year-over-year comparison as distribution revenue increased almost 30% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Turning to slide 10. During the quarter, we generated $30 million in adjusted free cash flow, down $54 million year-over-year driven by higher capital expenditures. We expect fiscal year 2023 adjusted free cash flow to be above $1 billion for the year, making this the eighth straight year of adjusted free cash flow above $1 billion. We ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.3 times. Looking ahead, we're focused on returning that leverage to our target range of 1.75 times to 2.25 times. Turning to slide 11 and our other financial guidance. We remain confident in the long-term trajectory of our business. WestRock's diverse portfolio of sustainable fiber-based packaging and complementary machinery uniquely position us to serve our customers.We are focused on serving our customers and growing our business through cross-selling, packaging innovations, and plastics replacement solutions. At the same time, we see significant opportunity to reduce costs by the following actions; one, leveraging our scale to capture cost savings and procurement; two, optimizing our logistics and planning; three, driving productivity in our mills and converting network; and fourth, streamlining our back-office operations. That said, we're not immune from macroeconomic conditions, which have created uncertainty in the near-term. As such, we're removing our full year guidance. Our forecast for second quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA is $625 million to $725 million and adjusted earnings per share is between $0.31 and $0.61.Some assumptions behind our sequential outlook include the following; favorable costs driven by natural gas down approximately 20% to $5 per MMBtu; OCC costs stable at $35 per ton; and stable costs in virgin fiber, chemicals and freight. An effective tax rate between 23% and 26% and approximately 257 million diluted shares outstanding. We are planning 132,000 tons of scheduled maintenance downtime across our system in the second quarter. I'll now turn it over to David to conclude before we move to Q&amp;A. David?David Sewell: Thanks Alex. While the current environment remains dynamic, WestRock's diversified business model and financial strength positions us very well. Our ability to provide corrugated packaging, consumer packaging and complementary machinery solutions differentiates us in the market and uniquely positions us to deliver a complete range of sustainable packaging solutions. In addition, our distribution business provides an additional channel for our products and allows us to serve a broader customer base. Our strong balance sheet and robust cash flow engine enables us to invest in our business and execute our transformation agenda in the midst of changing market conditions. We remain excited about the future, and we look forward to providing you updates on our progress. Thank you. And Rob, with that, let's move to Q&amp;A.Rob Quartaro: Thank you, David.

Quote Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up for the quarter to be reported.Factors at PlayRoyal Caribbean’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from is likely to benefit from improving booking volumes, digital initiatives and fleet-expansion efforts. During the previous quarter’s earnings call, RCL reported accelerating demand for sailings in 2023. It stated that booking volumes for 2023 doubled during the third quarter compared with the second quarter of 2022. The company noted better than expected load factors, owing to a rise in close-in bookings. Also, it reported early consumer engagement, with about 60% purchasing onboard experiences before the sailings.Given that the majority of its destinations and markets (outside China) resumed operations, the momentum is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter. Emphasis on new innovative ships and enhanced onboard experiences are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company anticipates total revenues to be nearly $2.6 billion.However, supply-chain constraints, elevated expenses (including fuel and food), uncertainty revolving around pandemic-induced cancellations and changing protocols might have affected RCL’s performance in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company expects depreciation and amortization expenses in the range of $355-$365 million. Net interest expenses for the fourth quarter are expected to be $355-365 million. The company expects adjusted loss per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.30-$1.50.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Royal Caribbean this time around.

Attributes such as best-in-class assets and locations, unparallel distribution and scale, and a solid organic development pipeline are likely to have aided the company’s performance.However, dismal casino and room revenues are likely to have impacted the company’s top line. We expect casino and room revenues to decline 1.5% and 14.3% year over year to $285.1 million and $37.1 million, respectively. Nevertheless, food and beverage revenues are likely to increase 8.9% year over year to $75 million.  Rise in labor and commodity costs is likely to have affected the performance. In the third quarter, the company witnessed price inflation in ordinary goods and services such as food costs, supplies, energy costs and construction costs.

299,aa71ba41-7a5b-35ca-adab-3935b6af88da,ADI,2023-02-03,Will Analog Devices (ADI) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-adi-beat-estimates-171005515.html,1675357805,STORY,['ADI'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Analog Devices (ADI), which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this semiconductor maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 4.76%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Analog Devices was expected to post earnings of $2.58 per share, but it reported $2.73 per share instead, representing a surprise of 5.81%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.43 per share, while it actually produced $2.52 per share, a surprise of 3.70%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Analog Devices, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Analog Devices currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.13%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 15, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This compares to earnings of $0.64 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.53%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $0.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.77, delivering a surprise of 1.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.M/A-Com , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, posted revenues of $180.1 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $159.62 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.M/A-Com shares have added about 8.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for M/A-Com?While M/A-Com has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for M/A-Com: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.74 on $177.7 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.05 on $715 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed is currently in the bottom 20% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Analog Devices (ADI), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 15.This semiconductor maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +33.5%.

But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Visa How Much Debt Does Visa Carry?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Visa had US$20.5b in debt in December 2022; about the same as the year before. However, it does have US$16.1b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$4.37b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Visa's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Visa had liabilities of US$19.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$29.1b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$16.1b as well as receivables valued at US$4.24b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$28.1b.Given Visa has a humongous market capitalization of US$472.1b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. But either way, Visa has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Visa has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.21. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 55.4 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. And we also note warmly that Visa grew its EBIT by 20% last year, making its debt load easier to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Visa's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Visa recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 83% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewHappily, Visa's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! Considering this range of factors, it seems to us that Visa is quite prudent with its debt, and the risks seem well managed. So we're not worried about the use of a little leverage on the balance sheet. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Largest Petrochemical Companies in the World.Petrochemicals are an essential part of our daily lives because of their ability to transform oil and gas into a variety of everyday products like plastics, fertilizers, packaging, apparel, digital devices, medical equipment, detergents, and tires. They are used in many components of the contemporary energy system, including solar panels, wind turbine blades, batteries, thermal insulation for buildings, electric car components, and essential items for our daily lives. Petrochemicals are becoming ever more crucial to the global energy system, where they already play a significant role. Since the turn of the millennium, demand for plastics, the most well-known petrochemical goods, has exceeded that of all other bulk materials (such as steel, aluminum, or cement). However, the industry has been in the headlines recently as it contributes to global carbon emissions, and climate activists have been pushing for the industry to move towards more sustainable production.The global petrochemical market size is projected to be valued at $798.8 billion by 2030, increasing from $523.56 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 5.4%. The U.S. Energy Information Agency’s International Energy Outlook projects that fossil fuels will supply 60% of primary energy consumption globally in 2050. The United States is a leader in the low-cost production of petrochemicals. Petrochemicals industrial production in the country is expected to be worth $79.8 billion in 2022 and is largely concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina.Largest Petrochemical Companies tcly / shutterstock.comAccording to the Energy Information Administration, USA's operable crude refining capacity was 17.94 million b/d on January 1, 2022, down from 18.09 million b/d at the start of 2021 and a record high of 18.98 million b/d in 2020 before the pandemic took hold. The estimate for 2022 is the lowest since 14.92 million b/d in 2014. EIA also mentions that refinery capacity might be lower than this figure because of the capacity reductions announced later in 2022. S&amp;P Global suggests various reasons for these refinery closures, including storm damage, pandemic effects, high operating costs, failure to finalize sales, lower future demand predictions, or conversions to generate more renewable fuels.Story continuesMoreover, the United States has not built any new refining capacity in decades. The last major refinery in the US came into operation in 1977 in Louisiana. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth made headlines last year when he stated that the United States would never build another refinery. His reasoning was simple: the national policy has been to restrict demand for petrochemicals, making this sector unappealing to investors, given that it takes a decade to recover the initial cost of building a refinery. His views are not incorrect; governments all over the world have been helping the electric vehicle industry to reduce the demand for petrochemicals. According to IHS Markit research, US oil and liquids demand might fall by around 25% from 20.3 million barrels per day in 2019 to an anticipated 15.3 million b/d in 2050. According to IHS's low-carbon policy scenario, US oil demand for transportation might fall to 7 million b/d by 2050. Globally, Equinor ASA predicts that demand for oil for transportation will shrink 47% between 2018 and 2050 if current trends continue, thanks to advances in fuel efficiency and electric vehicles.In the near future, the petrochemical industries of the Middle East and China will be the center of attention, with the EIA estimating that they will lead refining capacity increases in 2022 and 2023. The Saudi government is also pushing for a stronger presence in the downstream petrochemical industry to reduce its reliance on crude oil. To achieve this goal, Saudi Arabia has signed several deals with China to collaborate on various projects in the downstream oil business. Although most analysts believe that demand for petrochemicals will fall in the long term as the global economy shifts to more renewable resources, both the demand and supply of petrochemicals will increase in the next few years. According to McKinsey, continued growth in crucial end markets that utilize petrochemicals, such as packaging and construction, as well as economic development in China, India, and Southeast Asia, will boost demand. Meanwhile, the consulting firm expects supply to grow at a robust rate. However, in the ethylene market category, which dominates the petrochemicals industry, McKinsey predicts capacity to rise faster than demand, lowering profit margins in this segment.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 20 largest petrochemical companies in the world, we identified the biggest petrochemicals companies in major economies and ranked these companies in ascending order in order of their market cap.

311,4f9d8ca7-6e02-38bc-8848-4b44a59c1158,MAR,2023-02-03,China boosts imports of fuel oil blended from Russian barrels,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-boosts-imports-fuel-oil-031147759.html,1675393907,STORY,['CL=F'],"[By Chen Aizhu and Jeslyn LerhSINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's independent refineries are ramping up imports of discounted fuel oil blended from Russian barrels to use as low-cost feedstock amid a shortage of government crude oil import quotas for some of them, according to trade sources and data.Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including the looming Feb. 5 embargo and price cap on refined products, have been pushing Russian fuel oil barrels eastward into Asia at attractive discounts since last year.These have been flooding the ship-to-ship transfer hubs of Malaysia and United Arab Emirates' Fujairah since the second quarter of 2022. Traders blend these barrels with other oils to rebrand the fuel oil's country of origin, clearing the way for ship insurance and financing that would otherwise be banned under the sanctions, trade sources said.Discounts offered on these fuel oil cargoes help to improve margins at Chinese independent refiners and replace crude that some companies are unable to import without quotas, the sources said. The trade also provides a way to get Russian oil to market and bring much-needed export earnings to Moscow.""We've been looking at Russian fuel oil since December. It is cheap and does not require (crude) import quotas,"" said an executive with an independent refiner in eastern Shandong province.The refiner has not received any government crude quotas for the past year or so and buys mostly straight-run fuel oil to produce diesel and gasoline, said the executive, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.These blended fuel oil barrels were last traded at about a $5 discount to benchmark crude ICE Brent on a delivered Shandong basis, said one source.High-sulphur fuel oil values relative to crude have plunged into deeper discounts since the second quarter last year, with cracks hitting record lows at end-October.China's total fuel oil imports surged to about 1.76 million tonnes in December, highest since September 2021, official customs data showed.Story continuesThe uptick was driven by a surge in shipments from Malaysia to more than a one-year high at 620,000 tonnes, while monthly imports from UAE rose to 471,000 tonnes, highest in two years.Meanwhile, direct imports of fuel oil from Russia slipped to 187,000 tonnes in December after peaking at 554,000 tonnes in October, even as total imports from Russia more than doubled year-on-year to 3.1 million tonnes in 2022.China’s fuel oil imports from Malaysia and the UAE surge in Q4 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lgpdknwqavo/China's%20fuel%20oil%20imports.png""The deep discounts offered are driving the trend as independent refiners are price sensitive. China is still recovering, with domestic demand for refined fuels uncertain,"" said Emril Jamil, Refinitiv's senior analyst for crude and fuel oil.""The trend will continue with the EU ban (on Feb. 5), with all natural outlets in Europe closed. Asia will continue to soak up cheaper Russian (fuel oil) barrels on top of crude,"" Jamil said.TRADING COMPANIESWestern trading houses have been the main suppliers of these fuel oil shipments to China, said four senior trading sources, who closely track the flows, adding that the elevated December levels will extend through February and beyond.One of the top suppliers channelling these barrels to China is Swiss-based trader Vitol, they said.Over the last four months, Brilliant Jewel, a floating storage facility chartered by Vitol, conducted ship-to-ship transfer operations with at least six vessels that previously loaded fuel at Russian ports, a Reuters analysis of shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.Vitol did not respond to a request for comment.A second Chinese fuel oil trader said companies have become more relaxed in dealing with Russian barrels after initial confusion over the Group of Seven price cap and the potential risk of running afoul of sanctions.""Initially the market took a wait-and-see stance before Dec. 5, but now many traders are moving fuel oil from these two hubs, with the top western traders being the more active,"" said the trader.Leading Chinese bunker suppliers and traders like Sinopec and PetroChina's Chimbusco have also been sending more Russian high-sulphur fuel oil to bunkering hubs in eastern China's Zhoushan and Qingdao, sources said.Sinopec and Chimbusco did not respond to requests for comment.Shipping records show the companies have chartered several fuel oil shipments from Malaysia's Tanjung Pelepas port to Zhoushan and Hong Kong over the last four months.(Reporting by Chen Aizhu and Jeslyn Lerh; Editing by Florence Tan and Tom Hogue)]"

It hit a session low of $79.72, its lowest since Jan. 11.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) ended down $2.49, or 3.3%, at $73.39, after trading between $78.00 and $73.13, its lowest since Jan. 5.Brent registered a 7.8% decline this week while WTI dropped 7.9%.U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in January amid a persistently resilient labour market, but a further moderation in wage gains should give the Federal Reserve some comfort in its fight against inflation.""The market can't decide whether it should be nervous about a recession or more worried about the Federal Reserve being aggressive with interest rates,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group.The U.S. central bank on Wednesday scaled back to a milder rate increase than those over the past year, but policymakers also projected that ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs would be needed.Increases in interest rates in 2023 are likely to weigh on the U.S. and European economies, boosting fears of an economic slowdown that is highly likely to dent global crude oil demand, said Priyanka Sachdeva, market analyst at Phillip Nova.European Union countries agreed to set price caps on Russian refined oil products to limit Moscow's funds for its invasion of Ukraine, the Swedish presidency of the EU said on Friday.EU diplomats said the price caps are $100 per barrel on products that trade at a premium to crude, principally diesel, and $45 per barrel for products that trade at a discount, such as fuel oil and naphtha.The Kremlin said the EU embargo on Russia's refined oil products would lead to further imbalance in global energy markets.Story continuesMeanwhile, ANZ analysts noted a sharp jump in traffic in China's 15 largest cities after the Lunar New Year holiday but said that Chinese traders had been ""relatively absent.""In U.S. supply, energy firms this week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs by the most since June 2020, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said.

SNA grew more than 2% before the trading session on Feb 2, following better-than-expected top and bottom lines in fourth-quarter 2022. Moreover, sales and earnings advanced year over year.Results have gained from a continued positive business momentum and contributions from its Value Creation plan despite the tough environment. Management is on track with its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives.Shares of SNA have gained 13.5% in the past three months compared with the industry's 10.7% rally. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q4 HighlightsSnap-on’s earnings of $4.42 per share in fourth-quarter 2022 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.09 and our estimate of $3.94. The figure also improved 7.8% from earnings of $4.10 reported in the prior-year quarter.Net sales grew 4.3% to $1,155.9 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,151 million and our estimate of $1,150.1 million. The increase can be attributed to organic sales growth of 8%, which also came ahead of our estimate of 6.1% growth. This was somewhat offset by $37.7 million of negative impacts of foreign-currency translations. Sales and organic sales grew 21% and 22.7%, respectively, from the pre-pandemic levels of 2019.The gross profit of $560.7 million improved 5.1% year over year, while the gross margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 48.5% in the reported quarter.The company’s operating earnings before financial services totaled $248 million, up 6.8% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 50 bps to 21.5% in the fourth quarter. Financial Services' operating earnings were $63.9 million in the quarter, down 4.9% year over year.Consolidated operating earnings (including financial services) were $311.9 million, up 4.2% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings were flat year over year at 25.1%.Story continuesSegmental DetailsSales in Commercial &amp; Industrial Group declined 4.3% from the prior-year quarter to $343.2 million on a negative currency impact of $21.2 million. This was partly offset by organic sales growth of 1.7%. Organic growth was aided by higher sales in the segment’s specialty tools business and sales growth in critical industries, partly offset by the segment’s Europe-based hand tools business.The Tools Group segment’s sales rose 7.5% year over year to $542.7 million, driven by organic sales growth of 9.6%, offset by a $9.5-million negative impact of foreign currency. Robust sales in the U.S. and international operations aided organic sales.Sales in Repair Systems &amp; Information Group advanced 11.6% year over year to $437.9 million, with organic sales growth of 14.3%. Sales gains were somewhat offset by a $9.5-million negative impact of foreign currency. Strong sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and a rise in sales of under-car equipment contributed to segment organic sales growth. Increased activities with OEM dealerships also aided the segment’s results.The Financial Services business’ revenues rose 1.6% year over year to $88.3 million in the quarter.FinancialsAs of 2022 end, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $757.2 million, with long-term debt of $1,183.8 million and shareholders’ equity (before non-controlling interest) of $4,481.3 million.

This compares to earnings of $4.10 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.07%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this tool and diagnostic equipment maker would post earnings of $3.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.14, delivering a surprise of 10.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Snap-On , which belongs to the Zacks Tools - Handheld industry, posted revenues of $1.16 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.39%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.11 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Snap-On shares have added about 9.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Snap-On?While Snap-On has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Snap-On: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.10 on $1.13 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $16.83 on $4.6 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

325,0d4dc0ca-113b-33ca-86db-24355e881748,TPR,2023-02-03,Tapestry (TPR) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tapestry-tpr-expected-beat-earnings-150103613.html,1675350063,STORY,"['CPRI', 'TPR']","[Tapestry (TPR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of high-end shoes and handbags is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.03 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.67% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tapestry?For Tapestry, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Tapestry will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tapestry would post earnings of $0.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.79, delivering a surprise of +6.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Tapestry appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerCapri Holdings (CPRI), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.21 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -0.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.54 billion, down 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Capri Holdings has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.20%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Capri Holdings will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A couple of things stood out to me here. Of course, the company beat on earnings, stock getting a little bit of pop here. But I want to call out two things.First, is them teasing a new $1 billion cost-cutting program. I used to cover Stanley Black &amp; Decker as an analyst. And the one thing that always amazed me with this company is how efficient they are. And seemingly on the drop of a dime, they can come out with these major cost-cutting initiatives to boost margins. They just seemingly do this every single quarter. And oh, yeah, they actually execute and over time do improve their margins. So that was something worth calling out here.Now, on the negative side, they are noting that, overall, organic sales dropped 5% in their tools and outdoor segment. They're citing weakness in consumer-- lower consumer demand in the do-it-yourself-- do-it-yourself market.Now, that dovetails, guys, what we heard about a week ago from Sherwin-Williams. Not a great quarter from them. Not a great outlook. Immediately I'm thinking Home Depot, a Lowe's are sitting on disappointing quarters. Both those quarters just ended earlier this week for those two companies. And then maybe even the likes of a Traeger, another company that sells into the home centers. Maybe not a good quarter from them overall.You know, we've been talking about the impact of rates all morning long. When you look at Stanley Black &amp; Decker, I think that says a lot. Continue pressure, continue downturn the housing market. Of course, that gained steam late last year, impacting a company like this that sales tools that you need to build a home or repair what you got.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, it seems like they were still passing through some price increases during that quarter, as well. They noted that within the segment for tools and outdoor, as you were running through a moment ago. And regionally, Europe, that was down 3% during the quarter. North America down 7% during the quarter, as well.Story continuesSo really kind of going back to that consumer mindset that you were mentioning a moment ago, Sozz, and where some of the DIY projects-- I mean, if you've got tools, perhaps you don't need more tools to just continue to layer on.BRIAN SOZZI: You always need more tools.BRAD SMITH: Ah.BRIAN SOZZI: Maybe not now.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, bottom line, guys, it's surprising to see these shares up. They were trading lower in premarket trading. The forecast is pretty terrible, right? And yet the shares are trading higher. And I think this goes back to what we just heard from Tony Dwyer, that companies that are cutting costs are being rewarded even if the numbers don't look that great right now.I mean, you know, that's reflected, I think, in Meta to some extent, too. We're seeing a lot of examples of that. And Stanley Black &amp; Decker is just one of them.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, if there's any continuation in that industrial kind of decline that they saw, net sales down 1%, then that could certainly impact the margins even more so from here, as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.]"

This compares to earnings of $2.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 69.70%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this tool company would post earnings of $0.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering a surprise of 4.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stanley Black &amp; Decker , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products industry, posted revenues of $3.99 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.29%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.07 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Stanley Black &amp; Decker shares have added about 21.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Stanley Black &amp; Decker?While Stanley Black &amp; Decker has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Stanley Black &amp; Decker: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.45 on $3.79 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.18 on $16.08 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products is currently in the bottom 9% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

The results are expected to be released on February 21.This manufacturer of specialized welding products and other equipment is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18%.

Today, we reported third quarter fiscal 2023 results, another quarter with solid adjusted operating profit growth, underscoring the significant progress we continue to make in our company in terms of our overall company priorities. It also signals the continued strength and stability of our North American businesses. As a result of our third quarter performance and business outlook, we are raising our guidance range for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $24.45 to $24.95 to an updated range of $25.75 to $26.15. During today's call, I'm going to highlight the progress we've made across our four strategic priorities.Story continuesThen I'll ask Britt to provide additional details on the financial performance in our third quarter. As you know, a few years ago, we crafted our enterprise strategy and we shared our priorities with our stakeholders. We are evolving our portfolio of capabilities, and we have divested businesses that are not aligned with our strategy. And we have invested both organically and through acquisitions to add to our differentiated capabilities. We're increasing our focus on the areas where we have deep expertise and that are central to our long-term growth strategy. Our progress to date is underpinned by the execution against these important company priorities a focus on people and culture, intentional efforts to evolve and grow our portfolio of capabilities, to advance and expand our differentiated oncology ecosystem and our biopharma services platform and our commitment towards sustainable core growth.The strength of our core distribution businesses continued to show solid growth and generate free cash flow, which provides us a strong balance sheet and the ability to invest internally and externally into the business. I'll start with our first priority, our focus on people and culture. Embedded in our daily operations is our purpose, advancing health outcomes for all. McKesson is an impact-driven organization. We recognize that giving back to the community is important to our associates, and we continue to provide engaging and, most importantly, impactful ways for Team McKesson to do exactly that. In the third quarter, we had another successful Community Impact Day, where nearly 13,000 members of Team McKesson across North America volunteered to support nonprofits that provide food to people facing hunger.McKesson also held its annual Giving Tuesday, where Team McKesson's generosity resulted in $1.5 million in employee donations, with a portion of that matched by the McKesson Foundation, which will ultimately be distributed to 1,500 local, national and global charities. In addition to the progress made by our employees, the McKesson Foundation donated more than $4 million to pharmacy schools to help increase workforce diversity and improve overall health outcomes for vulnerable populations. These grants, which range from one to five years in duration, will support various pharmacy school education and community outreach programs. The innovative student support, professional development and community outreach that the McKesson Foundation is funding through these pharmacy school partnerships will help transform patient-pharmacist interactions, which we believe will lead to improved health equity and patient outcomes for vulnerable populations in their respective areas.I'm proud of our talented team as their dedication, hard work and innovation enables our business to positively impact our partners, our customers and our communities. Our next priority is to evolve and grow the portfolio. We have continued to evolve and grow our capabilities, ensuring that our capital deployment is tightly aligned with where we have the best growth opportunities. This led us to our decision to exit the European region as well as a handful of smaller businesses over the last several years. We're progressing on our plans to exit the European region and have successfully exited 11 of the 12 countries we operated in. We remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives for our business in Norway, which is the only country we have not yet divested.These actions allow us to focus our resources on areas that support our long-term strategy. It's provided us additional flexibility to invest internally or to look externally to expand our oncology and our biopharma ecosystems, which aligns well with our next company priority. We have made meaningful progress expanding our oncology and biopharma ecosystems as exemplified by the strategic investments made year-to-date. McKesson recently announced that The US Oncology Network, the U.S.'s largest oncology practice management organization, has continued to expand its geographic footprint with the addition of two new practices, Epic Care in California and Nexus Health in New Mexico. Both are now part of The US Oncology Network as of January 1, 2023.These practices offer a wide range of specialties, enabling more comprehensive care that helps ensure patients can conveniently receive the care they need in their local communities during their entire treatment and healing journey. And we're excited by the new opportunities that our joint venture with Sarah Cannon Research Institute as well as the acquisition of Genospace bring to our overall oncology ecosystem. I'm pleased with the substantial progress we've made in the development and expansion of our oncology ecosystem. This progress supports the solid performance of the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment as we further our long-term growth strategies. We will continue to evaluate internal and external opportunities to invest, to grow and to evolve this business.In addition to our oncology assets and capabilities, our biopharma services platform remains another priority area of growth. Over the last several years, we've systematically built and acquired an ecosystem of assets that complement on each -- that complement each other and are more valuable together than as separate stand-alone solutions. Together, these assets leverage our network reach, technology and clinical expertise to enable better access and affordability of medications, which ultimately improves patient outcomes and impacts real lives. We started building this business in 2006 with the acquisition of RelayHealth, which gave us connectivity to over 50,000 pharmacies. We've been able to integrate value-added services right into the workflow so that we can help their processes be more seamless and give the customer the experience they need and deserve.We then acquired CoverMyMeds, a long-term partner of McKesson in 2017. This expanded our network by providing connectivity with over 750,000 providers. The integration of CoverMyMeds' automation solution alleviates some of the friction out of the workflow providers, improving overall access for the patient. RxCrossroads brought a scale in the business that we already had, a hub services and patient support program, and they expanded our clinical expertise across many new therapeutic areas. In 2020, recall, we brought these businesses together as prescription technology solutions so we can migrate from providing individual offerings to a more comprehensive end-to-end suite of solutions. This enabled us to enhance our value proposition and to help find and get patients started on appropriate therapy more quickly.Most recently, we acquired Rx Savings Solutions, which helps employers and health plans reduce prescription drug costs by utilizing its advanced analytics capabilities. It's more than just price transparency. It really gives members insight and actionable guidance that can drive savings and improve health outcomes for patients. So, by bringing these businesses together, Relay, CoverMyMeds, RxCrossroads, Rx Savings Solutions, our McKesson prescription technology solutions connect pharmacies, providers, payers and biopharma manufacturers for really next-generation patient access, affordability and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. CoverMyMeds now processes approximately 21 billion pharmacy transactions annually on behalf of patients to support medication access and affordability.We continue to build and invest in innovative products that allow McKesson to provide unique insights and capabilities to our customers. And these investment dollars are reflected in our results in the segment year-to-date as well as in our fiscal 2023 outlook. During the third quarter, we continued to organically invest in this segment as we position our products and services for sustainable long-term growth. The investments have enabled us to expand the network and connectivity, develop new solutions and meet the growing demands of our customers. While we continue to invest and grow the platform, we're also always assessing opportunities to evolve and streamline the portfolio to ensure our resources and investments are focused on the products that bring the most value to patients.This business saw substantial momentum coming out of COVID-19 pandemic as our biopharma manufacturers continued to bring more brands to our platform and prescription utilization trends continued to improve. These factors led to strong adjusted operating profit growth in this segment in recent fiscal years. We remain confident in the overall trajectory in this segment and our financial target of 11% growth. And we will continue to reinvest profit into this business to accelerate this business over the long term. The investments made in our oncology and biopharma ecosystems have been possible largely due to the long-standing growth in our sustainable core distribution businesses, which are our fourth company priority. As we exit the European region, we've been able to focus our efforts on our North American businesses.Our teams are continuously evaluating how to drive efficiencies in our core operations. Whether that's leveraging a more modernized platform, it allows us to act with more speed and agility or ensuring we have the optimal talent and resources to help these businesses succeed. The fundamentals of our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segment remains strong. The work that Team McKesson has done to streamline process and efficiencies, combined with positive prescription volume and patient utilization trends, reinforces our confidence in our long-term growth for our North American distribution businesses. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical business, I'm excited to announce that our contract to extend our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS Health through June of 2027 has been finalized.Our long-standing partnership with CVS further exemplifies the value of our scaled distribution capabilities. The performance of the core operations in our North American distribution business enables strong cash flow generation that's allowed McKesson to continue to innovate and become a leading diversified health care services company. We believe we've made significant strides against our strategic priorities to focus on our people and culture, to grow and evolve the business, to invest in our oncology and biopharma services ecosystem underpinned by the sustainable core growth in our distribution businesses. Let me shift gears just a bit. McKesson has also made progress recently to address environmental sustainability. In January, McKesson received approval by the Science Based Targets initiative for its near-term climate change targets that contribute to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.Our SBTi target serves as another example of our commitment to sustainability and our response to climate change. We look forward to leveraging the advancements in climate related technologies that will address these environmental challenges while also enhancing our business and helping to fulfill our company purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. We will, of course, continue to provide updates on our progress to stakeholders on these targets as well as our ongoing ESG-related initiatives on future calls. As an organization, we're also committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion. McKesson was recently recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity in 2023. We're quite honored that Newsweek recognizes McKesson's ongoing efforts to be a more diverse and inclusive employer.All right, let me wrap things up. We are pleased with our solid results in the third quarter as we delivered on our growth strategy and as a diversified health care services company. McKesson's talented employees continue to demonstrate exceptional performance, and our third quarter results reflect their dedication and our execution together as a team in a dynamic operating environment. It also highlights the resiliency of our portfolio of businesses and solutions. Thank you all for your time. With that, Britt, I'm going to toss it over to you for additional comments on the financial results.Britt Vitalone: Well, thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our solid fiscal third quarter financial results reflect continued strong execution and momentum, advancing our company priorities. In the fiscal third quarter, we delivered solid growth across our North American segment, led by strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments. And we continue to evolve and grow our diversified portfolio through focused and strategic investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of our solid financial performance and confidence in the underlying business, we are increasing and narrowing our full year outlook for fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $25.75 to $26.15.Before I provide more details on our third quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP adjusted results, I want to point out two items that impacted our GAAP-only results in the quarter. First, we received proceeds of $129 million related to our share of an antitrust class action settlement. We recognized the gain within cost of sales in the third quarter. And second, we recognized a pretax gain of $97 million from the termination of fixed interest rate swaps. This gain is included under other income in the third quarter. Let's move now to a review of our third quarter non-GAAP adjusted results on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated revenues of $70.5 billion increased 3%, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment resulted from increased specialty product volumes, including retail national account customers, partially offset by lower revenues in the International segment, resulting from the completed divestitures of McKesson's European businesses.Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 11%. Gross profit was $3 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 10%. Excluding the impact of our European business operations and completed divestitures, gross profit increased 7%, primarily a result of growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Operating expenses in the quarter decreased 14%, largely driven by completed European divestitures in the International segment. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 9%. Operating profit was $1.4 billion, an increase of 9%, driven by a pretax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of a tax receivable agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare and due to growth across North American businesses led by the strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment.As a reminder, McKesson was a party to a TRA entered as part of the formation of the joint venture with Change Healthcare. Under the terms of the TRA, Change was generally required to pay McKesson a portion of net tax savings resulting from amortization by the joint venture. In October of 2022, Change exercised its right to terminate the agreement and paid McKesson $126 million. Consistent with our prior practice recognizing similar items, this benefit is reflected in other income in both our GAAP and adjusted operating results in the quarter. Moving below the line, interest expense increased to $69 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher interest rates and unfavorable impacts in our derivative portfolio as we exit the European region.And the effective tax rate was 23.4% for the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter-to-quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%. Wrapping up our consolidated results. Third quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was approximately 141 million, a decrease of 8%, resulting from share repurchase activity. Overall, third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.90, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. When excluding the impacts from COVID-19-related items and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 6%.Moving now to our third quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 12 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical, where revenues were $61.9 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, resulting from increased volume of specialty products, including higher volumes from retail national account customers, branded pharmaceutical price increases and strength in oncology, which included increased patient visits, partially offset by branded to generic conversions. Operating profit increased 6% to $778 million. Our contract with U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution provided a benefit of approximately $0.25 per share in the quarter compared to $0.26 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, U.S. Pharmaceutical segment delivered operating profit growth of 7%, driven by growth in distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, contributions from our generics programs, and improvements in pharmaceutical prescription volumes and oncology visits.In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, driven by increased prescription volumes, faster growth in our third-party logistics business and higher technology service revenues. Operating profit increased 7% to $155 million, driven by growth in access affordability and adherence solutions, partially offset by continued organic investments as we position our products and services for sustainable long-term growth. Next, moving on to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $3 billion, a decrease of 3%. Lower volumes of COVID-19 tests and kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program partially offset the growth in the Primary Care business.Operating profit increased 2% to $336 million. The contribution from COVID-19 tests and our contract with the U.S. government for the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies provided a total benefit of approximately $0.38 per share in the quarter as compared to $0.57 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivered operating profit growth of 25%, driven by growth in the Primary Care business and favorable sourcing activities, which partially offset lower volumes of COVID-19 tests and lower contribution from kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies from the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program. Next, let me address our International results.revenues were $4.4 billion, and operating profit was $143 million, a decrease of 36%. On an FX adjusted basis, revenues were $4.9 billion, a decrease of 48%, and operating profit was $158 million, a decrease of 29%. Third quarter results reflect the year-over-year effect from the divestiture of the European businesses. Moving next to corporate. Corporate expenses were $19 million, a decrease of 88% year-over-year, driven by the early termination of a tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare and lower opioid-related litigation expenses. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement, corporate expenses decreased 9%. Additionally, we incurred opioid-related litigation expenses of $9 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate that fiscal 2023 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $50 million.Turning now to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 13. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing and vary from quarter-to-quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we made $376 million of capital expenditures, which includes investments in distribution center capacity, automation and regulatory enhancements and investments in technology, data and analytics to support our growth priorities, including our oncology and biopharma services ecosystems. For the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we had free cash flow of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. During the quarter, we allocated $833 million towards M&amp;A activities, including a joint venture with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute and the acquisition of Rx Savings Solutions.We also returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, including $2 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $3.5 billion of share repurchases and $216 million in dividend payments. At the end of our fiscal third quarter, we had $3.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Let me turn to our fiscal 2023 outlook. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 15 through 18 in our supplemental slide presentation. And I'll begin with our consolidated outlook. Our revised guidance assumes 3% to 7% revenue growth and 2% to 6% operating profit growth as compared to fiscal 2022. Our guidance includes $2.30 to $2.50 of contribution attributable to the following four items: $0.70 to $0.80 related to the U.S. government's vaccine distribution in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment; $1.10 to $1.20 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution ancillary supplies in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment; approximately $0.15 related to year-to-date net losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments; and a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare.As a reminder, our contracts with the U.S. government for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies extends through July of 2023. We anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $435 million to $475 million, which includes net losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments, which we recorded in the first three quarters of the fiscal year, and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, which was recognized in the third quarter. As a reminder, our practice has been and will continue to not include McKesson Ventures portfolio estimates in our guidance. When excluding the impacts from COVID-19-related items, net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments and the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, we anticipate operating profit to increase 7% to 11%, above the previous operating profit growth target.Moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million. The increase compared to the prior guidance reflects the higher interest rate environment. Our anticipated full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%, 20% remains unchanged. Based on our third quarter results and our outlook for the fiscal year, we're increasing and narrowing our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share to $25.75 to $26.15 from the previous range of $24.45 to $24.95. When excluding the impacts of COVID-19-related items, net gains and losses from McKesson Ventures equity investments for both fiscal 2023 guidance and fiscal 2022 results and the fiscal 2022 benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare, our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance indicates approximately 13% to 16% growth over the prior year.Moving now to the segment outlook for fiscal 2023. In the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, we anticipate reported revenue to increase 12% to 15% and operating profit to increase 5% to 8%. As I outlined earlier, our outlook includes approximately $0.70 to $0.80 related to COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government. When excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government, we anticipate 7% to 9% operating profit growth. We are pleased with the momentum of the segment. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution business continues to deliver stable growth through focused execution and operational excellence. Let me highlight a few of the factors that are leading to the strong segment performance. First, we've observed stable prescription utilization growth, which underpins the momentum in our health system and retail offerings.Second, we maintain a favorable outlook for our oncology platform, which we see delivering higher growth and higher margin contributions. We continue to execute and invest against our oncology strategy. As Brian touched on earlier, we continue to add practices and providers to our scale and growing US Oncology network, and we are well positioned to capture increased oncology volumes. Third, we have a scaled an efficient generic sourcing operation, delivering stability of supply and low-cost products for our customers and patients. And specific to fiscal 2023, through the month of January, we observed branded pharmaceutical pricing that was modestly above our expectations. While fiscal 2023 results benefit from this modest increase, I would make the following two comments: first, the impact from higher branded pharmaceutical pricing remains less material now than historically, as more than 95% of our manufactured contracts are now on a fixed fee-for-service arrangement; and second, we would not anticipate this modest benefit to repeat in future years.Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment is well positioned and has exhibited strong performance, leading to the increased fiscal 2023 growth outlook. As a result of our execution and the factors that I just noted, we anticipate that this segment will now grow above the 4% earnings growth target rate that we previously provided, including at our 2021 Investor Day. The products and services within the Prescription Technology Solutions segment delivered differentiated access adherence and affordability products. We are pleased with the solid growth in both revenue and operating profit this quarter. Biopharma Services remain an important strategic growth and investment area for McKesson. We're confident this segment will exhibit faster growth and higher margin.We remain confident in our differentiated assets and capabilities. We have unmatched scale across transactions, provider and retail connectivity and product breadth. Our commitment to this segment is evidenced by the investments that we have made. Over the past three years, on average, we've organically invested approximately $100 million a year into new and existing products and services. And the recent acquisition of Arc Statement Solutions will accelerate the breadth of capabilities we continue to build out. We also anticipate further organic investments in new capabilities as well as more M&amp;A. The internal investment pattern, the mix of technology products and third-party logistics services and the life cycle of the products we serve, including the timing of launches, have resulted in variability in performance quarter-to-quarter.As we continue to invest and grow the business, we anticipate that there could be charges to further integrate product portfolios and supporting infrastructure. We anticipate delivering revenue growth of 10% to 16% and operating profit growth of 14% to 17%, which is in line with the 14% to 20% initial guidance that we communicated on our May 2022 earnings call and above the operating profit growth target of 11% provided at our Investor Day event in 2021. We are well positioned for strong growth, and we're committed to the operating growth targets that we've previously communicated. In the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we anticipate reported revenues to decrease 1% to 5% and operating profit to decrease 1% to 4%. As previously mentioned, our outlook includes approximately $1.10 to $1.20 related to COVID-19 tests and the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government.Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items, we anticipate Medical-Surgical operating profit to increase 12% to 15%. Finally, in the International segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 42% to 46% and operating profit to decline by 26% to 29%. This year-over-year decrease includes the loss of operating profit contribution from businesses and transactions that we have closed to date. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate our European operations will contribute operating profit of approximately $0.90 to $0.95 per diluted share, primarily in the first nine months of the fiscal year. This includes year-to-date contributions from operations prior to completed sales, our operations in Norway and the contribution resulting for held-for-sale accounting for the transaction with PHOENIX Group.Let me conclude our outlook with a review of cash flow and capital deployment. We continue to anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion, which is net of property acquisitions and capitalized software expenses. In fiscal 2023, our cash flows have also been impacted by European divestiture activities and other transactions. As discussed last quarter, our free cash flow guidance includes approximately $900 million of negative impacts from our European operations and divested assets. We remain committed to be good stewards of capital for our shareholders. We have and will continue to take a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We strategically think about capital allocation in three broad categories. First, we prioritize growth by investing internally and through M&amp;A.We are focused on accelerating our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. These growth platforms have differentiated asset scale and network capabilities. Next, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through a combination of our growing dividend and share repurchases. And the third piece of our framework is a strong balance sheet and adequate liquidity underpinned by the maintenance of an investment-grade credit rating. Our outlook continues to incorporate plans to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion of shares, which has been largely completed by the end of our fiscal third quarter. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $142 million.Let me take a moment and reflect on the fiscal 2023 outlook and our growth targets. At our 2021 Investor Day event, we shared with you a set of growth metrics that reflect our commitment to drive continued momentum across the business segments. Since then, we've executed on our strategy and delivered operating profit growth consistently at or above the targets that we communicated on a consolidated and on a segment level. Some of the business dynamics that we outlined previously have materialized as tailwinds and contributed to recent growth, including growth in prescription volume and patient mobility, our ability to grow through macroeconomic unpredictability and successful execution on a disciplined capital deployment strategy that focuses on growth and maximizing shareholder return.More importantly, the solid performance is further demonstration of our shareholder value creation framework. We continue to be focused on profitable growth and efficient deployment of capital. Our 24% return on invested capital illustrates our focus on shareholder value creation. In closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter. We continued to deliver solid operating results through focused execution and strategic investment. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our disciplined growth strategy and financial framework give us the confidence we will deliver on our operating profit growth targets. Thank you. And now with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions.See also 25 Largest Privately Held Companies in the US and 10 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

However, the loss per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share.We had projected the loss per share to be 2 cents, which matched the company-reported result.Revenues in DetailAccuray registered revenues of $114.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, down 1.3% year over year. The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.9%.The fiscal second-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $108.5 million.The overall top-line growth was mainly dampened by supply-chain constraints and foreign exchange headwinds.At constant exchange rate (CER), net revenues were $120.9 million, representing a 4% increase from the prior-year period.Segmental DetailsAccuray derives revenues from two sources — Products and Services.In the fiscal second quarter, Product revenues improved 4.2% from the year-ago quarter to $63.3 million. This figure compares to our Product revenues’ fiscal second-quarter projection of $55.9 million.At CER, Product revenues improved 8%.Services revenues fell 7.3% from the year-ago quarter to $51.5 million. This figure compares to our Services revenues’ fiscal second-quarter projection of $52.6 million.At CER, Services revenues were flat.Gross product orders totaled $79 million, down 7.4% year over year. This figure compares to our gross orders’ fiscal second-quarter projection of $88.4 million.On a sequential basis, gross product orders increased 13.2%.Accuray Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Accuray Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAccuray Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Accuray Incorporated Quote Margin TrendIn the quarter under review, Accuray’s gross profit rose 0.8% to $42.9 million. Gross margin expanded 78 basis points (bps) to 37.4%.We had projected 36.3% of gross margin for the fiscal second quarter.Story continuesSelling and marketing expenses rose 2.7% to $13.6 million. Research and development expenses fell 0.4% year over year to $14.6 million, while general and administrative expenses went up 12.3% year over year to $12 million. Total operating expenses of $40.3 million increased 4.2% year over year.Operating profit totaled $2.7 million in the fiscal second quarter, which declined 32.1% from the prior-year quarter. Operating margin in the fiscal second quarter contracted 107 bps to 2.4%.Financial PositionAccuray exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $67.7 million compared with $81 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter.Total debt (including short-term debt) at the end of the fiscal second quarter was $179.8 million compared with $176.3 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter.FY23 GuidanceAccuray has reiterated its outlook for fiscal 2023 based on current expectations.The company continues to expect its fiscal year revenues to be $447 million-$455 million, reflecting year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range of 5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $448.7 million.Our TakeAccuray ended the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. Robust Product revenues and geographical performances are impressive. Continued strong demand for Accuray’s ClearRT Helical kVCT Imaging for the Radixact System, Synchrony Technology and VOLO Ultra enhancement looks promising. During the reported quarter, the company received 34 new system orders globally, with notable strength in the America's region with solid year-over-year growth. In China, Accuray made impressive progress with respect to its CyberKnife and Radixact Systems, which also buoy our optimism.During the fiscal second quarter, Accuray advanced key strategic partnerships, including with C-RAD, introducing the VitalHold breast package. This is expected to allow Accuray to offer the most comprehensive breast package in the market. This also looks encouraging for the stock. Gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock.However, dismal overall top-line and bottom-line performances and lower Services revenues are disappointing. The decline in gross orders is also worrying. The operating margin contraction also does not bode well. The current global supply-chain shortages, forex woes and inflationary pressure are other challenges the company is navigating through, which is another concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAccuray currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The figure, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.6%.The adjustments include expenses related to purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs, among others.We had projected the fiscal first-quarter adjusted EPS to be $2.64.GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.70, reflecting a decline of 10.5% from the year-earlier figure.Revenues in DetailBD registered revenues of $4.59 billion in the fiscal first quarter, down 2.8% year over year. However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%.The fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $4.51 billion.At constant exchange rate (CER), revenues climbed 1.7%.The top-line improvement primarily resulted from strength in BD Medical and BD Interventional segments. However, the overall top-line improvement was partially offset by a fall in worldwide COVID-19-only diagnostic testing revenues.Base revenues were $4.55 billion in the fiscal first quarter, up 0.4% year over year on a reported basis and 5.2% at CER.Base organic revenue growth for the fiscal first quarter was down 1.7% on a reported basis but up 3% at CER.Segment DetailsBD’s operations consist of three worldwide business segments — BD Medical, BD Life Sciences and BD Interventional.For the quarter under review, BD Medical reported worldwide revenues of $2.15 billion, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and 6.1% at CER. Per management, this upside can be attributed to strong performances by the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems business units.This compares to our projection of fiscal first-quarter segmental revenues of $2.11 billion.Worldwide revenues in the BD Life Sciences segment totaled $1.30 billion, down 12.2% year over year on a reported basis and down 7.3% at CER. The decline resulted primarily from the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions (IDS) unit’s fall in COVID-only diagnostic testing revenues. However, this was partially offset by the IDS unit’s strong growth in the base business (driven by strong demand for BD’s respiratory testing portfolio, which was partly aided by timing of dealer orders, strong BD Kiestra lab automation installations and leveraging its higher BD MAX installed base for molecular In Vitro Diagnostic assay growth) and strength in the Biosciences unit.Story continuesThe fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $1.33 billion.BD Interventional segment generated worldwide revenues of $1.13 billion, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and 5.6% at CER. This was owing to strength in the Peripheral Intervention business unit.The fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $1.07 billion.Geographic ResultsIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, revenues in the United States improved 0.9% to $2.73 billion.The fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $2.56 billion.International revenues grossed $1.86 billion, down 7.9% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis but up 2.7% at CER.The fiscal first-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $1.95 million.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Becton, Dickinson and Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBecton, Dickinson and Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Becton, Dickinson and Company Quote Margin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, BD’s gross profit fell 3.9% to $2.13 billion.

Research and development expenses declined 0.3% year over year to $313 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $1.50 billion increased 0.1% year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $633 million, reflecting a 12.2% decline from the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating margin in the fiscal first quarter contracted 148 bps to 13.8%.Financial PositionBD exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $612 million compared with $1.01 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. Total debt (including current debt obligations) at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023 was $16.46 billion compared with $16.07 billion at the end of fiscal 2022.Net cash flow from continuing operating activities at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023 was $399 million compared with $530 million a year ago.Meanwhile, BD has a consistent dividend-paying history, with its five-year annualized dividend growth being 3.97%.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceBD has revised its financial outlook for fiscal 2023.BD now projects its full fiscal year revenues to be in the range of $19.1 billion-$19.3 billion, up from the earlier-provided projections of $18.6 billion-$18.8 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $18.88 billion.The revenue projections for fiscal 2023 now include base-business revenue growth at CER of 5.75-6.75%, up from the earlier expectations of an uptick of 5.25-6.25%.The outlook now estimates around $50 million-$100 million in COVID-19-only diagnostic testing revenues, down from the earlier projections of $125 million-$175 million.For the full fiscal year, adjusted EPS is now anticipated to be $12.07-$12.32, up from the earlier estimates of $11.85-$12.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $11.94.Our TakeBD exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. An improvement in the overall base revenues and robust performances by the majority of its segments and in the United States are impressive. Strength in BD’s segment’s business units during the reported quarter was also promising.BD’s recent agreement with Biocorp and a co-exclusive commercial agreement with Magnolia Medical Technologies, Inc. look promising. BD’s recent launch of a new, robotic track system for the BD Kiestra microbiology laboratory solution — 3rd Generation BD Kiestra Total Lab Automation System — is encouraging. BD and CerTest Biotec’s receipt of the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization for VIASURE Monkeypox Virus Real Time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) Reagents for BD MAX System, which is now available for BD MAX System users, also raises our optimism.However, the year-over-year decline in reported revenues is disappointing. The fall in BD Life Sciences and international revenues is worrying. Lower COVID-only testing revenues in the quarter and BD’s expectations of its continued fall during fiscal 2023 are discouraging from a business perspective. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Key PicksBD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The top line increased 5.4% year over year, reflecting strong growth in the United States, partially offset by lower international sales due to divestitures of its European businesses.Q3 Segmental AnalysisFollowing McKesson’s segment realignment in the quarter under review, the reporting segments are as follows:Revenues at the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment were $61.9 billion, up 13% year over year. Per management, the upside was primarily driven by market growth and a higher volume of specialty products, including an increase in volumes from retail national account customers. However, branded-to-generic conversions partially offset the upside.The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment reported an adjusted operating profit of $778 million, up 6% from the prior-year quarter. This was due to growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, partially mitigated by lower demand for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The adjusted metric for the segment was up 7%, excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution.At the International segment, revenues amounted to $4.4 billion, down 53% year over year, due to divestitures of McKesson’s European businesses.McKesson Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McKesson Corporation QuoteAdjusted operating profit at the segment was $143 million, down 36% from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesRevenues at the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment totaled $3 billion, down 3% year over year due to lower COVID-1-related sales, partially offset by growth in the primary care business.The Medical-Surgical segment delivered an adjusted operating profit of $336 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the adjusted metric was up 25%.Revenues at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment totaled $1.1 billion, up 9% year over year. The improvement can be attributed to an increase in prescription from third-party logistics as well as higher technology services revenues.Adjusted operating profit was $155 million at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, up 7% from the prior-year quarter.MarginsGross profit in the reported quarter was $3.17 billion, down 7.4% on a year-over-year basis.

The company raised the guidance following solid fiscal third-quarter results.

It also includes a negative impact of 15 cents related to year-to-date net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments.Summing UpMcKesson exited the fiscal third-quarter on a strong note, beating estimates for revenues and earnings. The strong fiscal third-quarter show across all its four segments is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instills optimism.However, price fluctuation of generic pharmaceuticals and stiff competition in the MedTech space are other headwinds.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMcKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, Cardinal Health CAH and Hologic, Inc.

However, both the metrics exceeded the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The sluggish year-over-year results were due to a dull underlying market, which, per management, was impacted by macroeconomic environmental factors and extremely unfavorable currency translation. The quarter witnessed the significant foreign exchange impact.The contraction of both margins is worrisome. The volatility surrounding inflationary pressure, weaker consumer confidence, the lingering impacts of COVID-19 shutdowns, primarily in China and Japan, and other macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges for the company.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAlign Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the company realigned its reporting structure under two reportable segments — U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions.Segmental AnalysisU.S. Healthcare SolutionsRevenues at this segment totaled $56.2 billion, indicating an increase of 6.1% on a year-over-year basis on the back of an increased specialty product sales and overall market growth. Lower revenues from commercial COVID-19 treatments partially offset the upside.AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmerisourceBergen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmerisourceBergen Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteSegmental operating income was $572.4 million, up 0.6% year over year.

As a percentage of revenues, the adjusted operating margin was 1.2% in the quarter, which contracted 9 bps from the year-ago quarter.The decline in revenues and adjusted operating income was primarily due to loss of revenues following its Brazil specialty business divestiture in June last year and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates impacting International Healthcare Solutions’ sales. On a constant currency basis, revenues and adjusted operating income were up 17.7% and 10.8%. respectively.Financial PositionThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents worth $1.69 billion, compared with $3.39 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of the fiscal first-quarter totaled $710.1 million, compared with $863.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Dividend UpdateDuring the quarter, AmerisourceBergen's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 48.5 cents per share, to be paid on Feb 27, to shareholders at the close of business on Feb 10, 2023.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceAmerisourceBergen raised its fiscal 2023 outlook for earnings to reflect lower share count, early closure of PharmaLex acquisition and the impact of currency rates.

Excluding impacts of merger and acquisition, and currency fluctuations, the metric is likely to improve 1-5%.Summing UpAmerisourceBergen exited the fiscal first quarter on a strong note, wherein both earnings and revenues beat the consensus mark. The company witnessed a strong segmental performance in the quarter under review. The expansion of both gross and operating margins is a positive.Per management, AmerisourceBergen delivered a solid performance by playing a crucial role in the healthcare system while maintaining execution throughout its business. Apart from this, the company's AB Health Ventures — a dedicated corporate venture capital fund — focused on investing in and collaborating with emerging healthcare startup companies that are involved in transforming healthcare for people and animals worldwide.However, the company faces headwinds like conversion of branded drugs and lower-price generics.

The company’s market cap plunged by US$4.1b after price dropped by 5.9% last week.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.  Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals  The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Air Products and ChemicalsThis was the biggest insider sale at about US$313 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$296. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Sean Major and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this may be slightly concerning, but it's not the be-all and end-all.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Air Products and Chemicals insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$218m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Air Products and Chemicals Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Air Products and Chemicals stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Air Products and Chemicals is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

Slide two in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.Scott Anderson: Thank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start today's call by expressing my appreciation and the Board's gratitude for the contributions that Bob Biesterfeld made to C.H. Robinson over his 24 years with the company, including his three years as CEO. Under Bob's guidance, C.H. Robinson navigated the challenges presented by the pandemic and the ongoing supply chain disruptions. And he played an important role in positioning Robinson for long-term success. We wish Bob all the best. In order to accelerate C.H. Robinson's strategic initiatives and take the company into its next chapter, the Board felt that a change in leadership was needed. Jodee Kozlak, the newly appointed Chair of the Board, is leading the Search Committee to find a new CEO.Story continuesWith Jodee's background and expertise, I can't think of anyone more qualified to lead the Board and the search process. To give you a little of my background, I've spent over 10 years as a Director here at Robinson and the last three years as Chairman of the Board. I've spent the first 25 years of my career at Patterson Companies, most recently as CEO from 2010 to 2017 and also Chairman from 2013 to 2017. I look forward to working closely with Jodee and the Board as well as the whole Robinson team in the coming weeks and months. I'm excited to bring my experience and my knowledge of Robinson to the role of Interim CEO. I'm leveraging the relationships I have with the senior leadership team to ensure that we continue delivering superior global services and capabilities to our customers and carriers while continuing to execute with great focus on our sustainable growth strategy.During my first few weeks as Interim CEO, I've been meeting with our customers and employees who are highly engaged and motivated to win. And I'm confident in our ability to navigate this transition and deliver for our customers. Throughout the transition, we're increasing our focus on delivering a scalable operating model to lower our costs, improve the customer and carrier experience, and foster long-term profitable growth through cycles. The current point in the cycle is one of shippers managing through elevated inventories amidst slowing economic growth, causing unseasonably soft demand for transportation services. At the same time, prices for ground transportation and global freight forwarding are declining due to the changing balance of supply and demand.While the correction in the freight forwarding market was certainly expected, the speed and magnitude of the correction in only two quarters was unexpected, with ocean rates on some trade lanes already back to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, our operating costs were misaligned. As was announced on our third quarter earnings call, we have taken actions to structurally reduce our overall cost structure. The actions are expected to generate net annualized cost savings of $150 million by Q4 2023 as compared to the annualized Q3 2022 run rate. If growth opportunities or economic conditions play out differently than we expect, we'll adjust our plans accordingly. I believe we're uniquely positioned in the marketplace to deliver for our shippers, carriers and shareholders through a combination of our digital solutions, our global suite of services and our network of global logistics experts.Now let me turn it over to Mike for a review of our fourth quarter results.Mike Zechmeister: Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q4 financial results reflect the price declines and slowing demand in the freight forwarding and surface transportation markets that Scott referenced earlier. Our fourth quarter total company adjusted gross profit or AGP was down $88 million or 10.3% compared to Q4 of 2021 driven by a 39% decline in Global Forwarding and partially offset by a 5.7% growth in NAST. The market softness was also prominent on a sequential basis, with total company AGP down 13%, including a 24% decline in Global Forwarding and an 11% decline in NAST. On a monthly basis, compared to Q4 of 2021, our total company AGP per business day was down 10% in October, down 7% in November and down 14% in December.In our NAST truckload business, our volume declined on a year-over-year basis for the first time in seven quarters with shipments down 4%. Within the fourth quarter, monthly volume declined sequentially from October through December as freight demand weakened. Our AGP per truckload shipment increased 6.5% versus Q4 last year due to an increase in our contractual truckload AGP per shipment. On a sequential basis, however, our truckload AGP per shipment came down 6.5% but remained above our 10-year average. During Q4, we had an approximate mix of 65% contractual volume and 35% transactional volume compared to a 55-45 mix in the same period a year ago. Routing guide depth of tender in our Managed Services business, which is a proxy for our overall market, declined from 1.3 in the third quarter to 1.2 in the fourth quarter, which is the lowest level we've seen since the pandemic impacted second quarter of 2020.The sequential declines in our truckload linehaul cost price per mile that we experienced in Q1 through Q3 continued in Q4 as excess carrier capacity, combined with slowing demand, led to the softening market conditions. This resulted in an approximate 24% year-over-year decline in our average truckload linehaul cost paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges. Our average linehaul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased year-over-year by approximately 21%. With the cost down 24% and price down 21%, we saw a 3% increase in our NAST truckload AGP per mile on a year-over-year basis. In our Global Forwarding business, higher customer inventory levels, combined with softening demand, contributed to significantly reduced import prices for ocean and airfreight.In Q4, Global Forwarding generated AGP of $188.7 million, representing a year-over-year decrease of 39% versus the record high fourth quarter in 2021, which was up 72%. With these results, our ocean forwarding AGP declined $89 million or 43% year-over-year compared to an 86.5% growth in Q4 of 2021. The Q4 results were driven by a 36.5% decrease in AGP per shipment and a 9.5% decrease in shipments. AGP in our airfreight business declined by $33 million or 51.5% year-over-year compared to a 92% growth in Q4 of 2021. This was driven by a 40% decline in AGP per metric ton and a 19.5% decrease in metric tons shipped. Despite the soft market, the forwarding team continues to add new customers and diversify our industry verticals and trade lanes. In Q4, approximately 50% of our AGP from new business was generated from trade lanes other than the trans-Pacific lane.Now turning to expenses. Q4 personnel expenses were $427.3 million, up 1.7% compared to Q4 last year, including $21.5 million of severance and related charges driven by the restructuring that we initiated in November. The restructuring-related costs were partially offset by a decrease in equity compensation as we reversed some previously accrued expense due to financial results that came in lower than previously expected. On a sequential basis, Q4 personnel expenses declined $10.2 million. Excluding the restructuring charges in Q4, personnel expenses declined $31.7 million sequentially due to lower incentive compensation and lower salaries and benefits associated with reduced headcount. Our Q4 average headcount declined 2% versus our Q3 average.The workforce reduction initiated in November affected approximately 650 employees. While nearly 150 of those employees had left the company prior to December 31, over 600 had exited as of early January. As we continue to make progress on delivering a scalable operating model, we expect our headcount to decline throughout 2023 as productivity improves. For 2023, we expect our personnel expenses to be $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, down approximately 7% at the midpoint compared to our 2022 total of $1.72 billion, primarily due to reduced headcount. Excluding the restructuring charges in Q4 of 2022, the midpoint of our 2023 guidance for personnel expenses is down approximately 6% year-over-year. Moving on to SG&amp;A. Q4 expenses of $176.8 million were up $27.9 million compared to Q4 of 2021 driven primarily by $15.2 million of restructuring charges and a year-over-year increase in legal settlements, partially offset by a decrease in credit losses.The restructuring charges in SG&amp;A primarily included an impairment to internally developed software related to the reprioritization of our technology investments that Arun will speak to shortly. Our approach to investments and investment prioritization is more data-driven and more focused on delivering a scalable operating model than in the past, which is improving the value of the benefits we are delivering and allowing us to pivot more quickly if investments are not delivering as expected. For 2023, we expect our total SG&amp;A expenses to be $575 million to $625 million compared to $603.4 million in 2022. The slight decrease at the midpoint includes an expected decrease in legal settlements in the absence of two onetime items that occurred in 2022.Those include the $15.2 million Q4 restructuring charge and the $25.3 million Q2 gain from the sale and leaseback of our Kansas City regional center. 2023 SG&amp;A expenses are expected to include approximately $90 million to $100 million of depreciation and amortization expense compared to $93 million in 2022. Q4 interest and other expense totaled $42.5 million, up $24.1 million versus Q4 of last year. Q4 of 2022 included $24.8 million of interest expense, up $10.7 million versus the prior year, primarily due to higher short-term average interest rates. Q4 results also include a $16.9 million loss on foreign currency revaluation, up $10.4 million compared to Q4 of last year driven by the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar. As a reminder, the FX impacts are predominantly non-cash gains and losses on intercompany balances, which is why they are not hedged.Q4 tax rate came in at 20.9%, bringing our full year tax rate to 19.4%. We expect our 2023 full year effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%, assuming no meaningful changes to federal, state or international tax policy. Q4 net income was $96.2 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.80. Adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the $36.7 million of restructuring charges, was $1.03, down 41% compared to Q4 of '21, which was up 61% versus the prior year. Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow generated by operations was a record $773.4 million compared to $75.9 million in Q4 of 2021. As we have talked about in prior earnings calls, we were expecting an improvement in working capital when the cost and price of purchase transportation came down.The $698 million year-over-year improvement was driven by a $650 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital in Q4 due to the declining cost and price of ocean, air and truckload in our model. Conversely, Q4 of last year included a $200 million sequential increase in net operating working capital as costs and prices were rising. If you look back at the period when cost and price of purchased transportation was rising from the end of 2019 to Q2 of 2022, our net operating working capital increased by approximately $1.5 billion. Between Q3 and Q4, as the cost and price of purchased transportation has come down, we have realized over $1 billion of benefit to working capital and operating cash flow. That benefit has come on a lag basis based on our DSO and DPO.Driven by the increased free cash flow generation in Q4, we returned $507 million of cash to shareholders through $438 million of share repurchases and $69 million of cash dividends. The Q4 cash returned to shareholders significantly exceeded net income and was up by 128% versus Q4 last year driven by the record cash flow. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, to the extent that we have excess cash after managing through our commitments, investments and holding to an investment-grade credit rating, we are committed to returning that cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Capital expenditures were $27.8 million in Q4, bringing our full year capital spending to $128.5 million, up $58 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in internally developed software.Travel mania/Shutterstock.comWe expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Now on to the balance sheet highlights. We ended Q4 with approximately $1.34 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.12 billion of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $218 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q4 was $1.97 billion, up $55 million versus Q4 last year, primarily driven by our expanded capacity to borrow given the strong EBITDA performance. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 1.29 times, down from 1.42 times at the end of Q4 last year. As I mentioned, our capital allocation strategy is based on maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which allows us to optimize our cost of capital. As we anticipate reduced earnings in 2023 given the strong results in the first half of 2022, we are planning for a lower level of debt to deliver our leverage targets.To the extent that we reduce our debt levels, this may reduce the amount of cash used for share repurchases. In December, our Board authorized and declared a 10.9% increase in our regular quarterly dividend taking it to $0.61 beginning with the dividend that was paid in January. We have now distributed uninterrupted dividends without decline for more than 25 years. Over the long term, we remain committed to growing our quarterly cash dividend in alignment with long-term EBITDA growth and using our share repurchase program as important levers to enhancing shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Arun to walk through our strategy to deliver a scalable operating model and strengthen our customer and carrier experience.Arun Rajan: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. During the fourth quarter, we continued to focus our efforts on working backwards from customers and carriers needs to build a scalable operating model. A scalable operating model improves customer and carrier experience and improves service levels while simultaneously reducing our cost to serve. These efforts include operationalizing our information advantage at scale by giving customers insights around price and coverage and providing features to carriers that improve their utilization and cash flow. Increased digitization is a key element of the scalable operating model. There are a number of data points that demonstrate our progress in 2022, including 183% increase in loads booked digitally by carriers and increased digitization across the board as evidenced by 2.3 billion digital transactions with customers and carriers, which represented a 30% increase year-over-year.In 2023, we will continue to deliver meaningful improvements to our customer, carrier and employee experience by accelerating the digital execution of all touch points in the life cycle of the road, including order management, appointments, in-transit tracking, cash advances and financial and documentation processes. We made progress on this front in Q4 as well with the automation of appointment-related tasks, increasing 34% year-over-year and in-transit tracking automation increasing by 450 basis points versus Q3. We are focused on opportunities to automate or make self-serve those processes that are core to our operating model, which we expect will enable us to decouple volume and headcount growth and drive increased productivity while simultaneously improving the customer experience and service levels.Throughout 2023, we'll provide updates on the progress we're making on shipments per person per day, which is a key metric to measure our productivity improvements. During the recent restructuring efforts, we continued our ongoing evaluation and prioritization of our tech and software projects. Through the assessment of those projects, we determined that some were no longer relevant to the acceleration of our scalable operating model, and we incurred the restructuring charges that Mike described earlier. The remaining projects are better aligned to improve the customer and carrier experience and reduce our cost to serve. And therefore, we're allocating more of our investments to those projects. We've also taken steps to align compensation and incentives to support our strategic priority of creating a scalable operating model, which is foundational to being the low-cost operator, which ultimately gives us the pricing flexibility to unlock and accelerate long-term market share growth while delivering our long-term operating margin targets.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott for his final comments.Scott Anderson: Thanks, Arun. As inflationary pressures continue to weigh on global economic growth and freight markets present cyclical challenges, we need to continue evolving our organization to bring great focus to our highest long-term strategic priorities, including keeping the needs of our customers and carriers at the center of what we do while lowering our overall cost structure by driving scale. I believe in the strategy that the team is executing on to deliver a scalable operating model. We expect this initiative will continue to drive improvements in our customer and carrier experience and amplify the expertise of our people, all of which will drive share gains and growth. And as Arun said, we expect these efforts will also improve our productivity, which will reduce our operating costs and lead to improved returns for our shareholders.I'd like to close by saying thank you to our employees for persevering during the period of extended market disruption and the market correction that is followed and for continuing to provide industry-leading service to our customers and carriers. This concludes our prepared remarks.

LRN, Herc Holdings Inc. HRI, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and Cigna Corp. CI.Add These 4 Stocks with Amazing Interest Coverage RatiosGiven the current scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Stride, Inc., Herc Holdings Inc., ONEOK, Inc. and Cigna Corp. are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesHere are four picks out of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Stride, a technology-based education company, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A.

367,598b528e-6769-370e-adf3-2dc28dcec56f,OKE,2023-02-03,Oneok (OKE) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-oke-incredible-growth-stock-174505651.html,1675359905,STORY,['OKE'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Oneok Inc. (OKE) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this natural gas company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Oneok is 10.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 25% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.8%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Oneok is 78%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 11%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 23.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Oneok have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.9% over the past month.Bottom LineOneok has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Oneok is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

368,cb5068e2-b052-334f-a7de-7987164b0c0a,OKE,2023-02-03,Why Oneok (OKE) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-oneok-oke-could-beat-171005721.html,1675357805,STORY,['OKE'],"[If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Oneok Inc. (OKE). This company, which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this natural gas company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 6.37%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Oneok was expected to post earnings of $0.93 per share, but it reported $0.96 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.23%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.84 per share, while it actually produced $0.92 per share, a surprise of 9.52%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Oneok, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Oneok currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.44%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 27, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With that said I'll turn the call over to John Lindsay.John Lindsay: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our quarterly results and remain optimistic about the year ahead. Our first fiscal quarter results of 2023 showed another strong sequential improvement in financial performance and a continuation of the momentum established in fiscal 2022. We remain focused on our three strategic objectives, which are North America Solutions pricing and margin cycle dynamics, H&amp;P's international opportunities and our investments related to technology and sustainability. Almost a year has passed since we set into motion plans to achieve revenue per day in excess of $30,000 and direct margins of 50% in our North America Solutions segment. These financial guideposts were established as proxies for what is required to generate sustainable levels of economic return in this capital intensive business.Story continuesThis recent quarter marks a milestone in achieving that revenue per day goal as our average revenue per day was $33,000. Our per day direct margins were approximately 47%, very close to achieving our direct margin goal but still earning the highest margin level since 2014. This headway achieved in just a year generated significant value for shareholders. On our last earnings call in November and subsequent discussions with investors, we laid out our expectation for a moderation in activity growth for both H&amp;P and the industry rig count during the December quarter relative to what we have seen over the last two years. That expectation is being realized and is largely attributable to the capital discipline exhibited by our customers and their desires to drive more consistent and sustainable shareholder returns.We've seen time and again that in a highly cyclical industry like oil and gas, losing sight of the long run can be fatal. So we believe that capital discipline contributes to the overall economic health of our company as well as our industry. Most of our large public customer budgets appear to be moderately higher in 2023 and we are planning ahead to manage this potential growth in an optimal fashion. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our plans for adding no more than 16 incremental rigs to our North America solutions rig count during fiscal 2023, dependent upon customer demand and would expect contractual churn to satisfy other points of rig demand. There has, however, been a change in the maximum number of rigs we can now achieve with 16 incremental rig adds.Previously that number was 192, but is now 191 rigs due to losing an active rig as a result of a rig fire during operations. Thankfully no H&amp;P employees were injured during the incident. We were able to quickly respond and utilize one of the 16 incremental rigs as a replacement for the rig that was lost hence the maximum number of active rigs we could reach in fiscal 2023 is now reduced to 191. During our earnings call in mid-November, we mentioned having 11 of these 16 incremental rigs committed and today we have 12. 10 are currently working and the remaining two are contracted to begin work in February and March. The four uncommitted rigs will not reactivate without contracts, which include margins and term commitments that justify their deployment.To be clear if, we can't achieve those objectives our preference would be to allow rig churn and spot market pricing to satisfy incremental rig demand. In light of this here are three industry data points to keep in mind. First, utilization of the active super-spec fleet is currently over 80%, a level which is supporting current pricing. Second, the idle super-spec fleet has now been inactive for over three years making reactivation and expensive proposition. The third point is that there are roughly 520 super-spec rigs operating currently, which is effectively 100% utilization for those rigs that have worked some time in the last three years. Accordingly, we expect the current utilization of the active super-spec fleet to remain at very high levels.With our expected rig count we anticipate financial results in the second quarter to continue on an upward trajectory with direct margins per day moving closer towards our target level of 50%. While some may be concerned with the momentum of the current cycle, our experience over the past few decades is that we should expect to have moderate and choppy activity trends like today. An up cycle is rarely straight up and to the right. Another opportunity for us during the next few quarters is having more of our fleet with long-dated term contracts rollover to current market pricing. Bringing the pricing of those rigs in line with the rest of the fleet will have a positive impact on our pricing and margin objectives going forward. Regarding the International Solutions segment, the company's expansion efforts are centered around unconventional drilling where H&amp;P has significant experience drilling unconventional wells given that our FlexRig fleet has drilled over 30,000 horizontal wells in the US over the past 10 years.This extensive experience can provide substantive value to customers with a complement of people, processes, rigs and technology. We are moving forward on several fronts to set the company on for future growth. Efforts to grow our Middle East presence continue with the pursuit of additional work in the region and our operational hub, which should be stood up during the last half of fiscal 2023. Preparations to send a super-spec rig to Australia for an unconventional gas play in the Beetaloo Basin are well underway. These international unconventional plays provide a great opportunity for H&amp;P to locate super-spec FlexRigs in the Middle East and other unconventional growth areas without the need to build new rigs. These rigs and our capabilities provide great opportunity to utilize the idle FlexRig capacity and showcase our technology to grow our international footprint.Our offshore Gulf of Mexico segment remains a steady reliable contributor to the company's overall financial performance. That said, we are expecting some variability later in the year as we do have one rig contract that is set to expire during the fourth fiscal quarter. On the technology front, we continue to experience a growing appreciation for our technology solutions which are adding significant value for our customers through rig efficiencies and wellbore quality. Many of our technology products and automation solutions have become integral parts of the bid process and daily operational workflows. Our operational and technology teams are delivering outstanding results for customers. Longer laterals and more consistent target attainment continue to be key themes for our customers.To achieve both, we have seen increasing usage across our technology portfolio with automation driving consistent three-plus mile lateral delivery. This trend is not limited to one customer or one basin, but rather is becoming the way we work and deliver value. We believe this type of repeatable reliable performance will continue to drive the adoption of H&amp;P technology by our customers, as well as expand our revenue growth. This keeps our teams excited about the future, a future where digital technology helps drive customer value, by providing safer more efficient and repeatable drilling operations. Maintaining a fiscally disciplined approach to our business is a key tenet of our long-term strategy and is a major driver behind the company's improving financial results.Mark will provide details in his comments regarding our capital allocation efforts to-date for 2023. But we are pleased with the execution to-date for our supplemental shareholder plan and opportunistic share repurchase efforts. In conclusion, we remain optimistic about the outlook for 2023 and the longer-term energy macro fundamentals. I've had meetings with some of our most active customers this quarter and I'm very pleased with what I have heard regarding the value proposition H&amp;P provides, the pride of the H&amp;P team and the differentiated results we helped to deliver. As a result of the hard work and dedication of our employees during this past year, we are positioned to respond effectively to healthier industry conditions and improve the profitability of the company.Working closely with customers to identify and then provide industry-leading drilling solutions, we are creating value for these customers and we're beginning to receive commensurate compensation for the value we help create. We will carry this mindset forward to the benefit of both customers and our shareholders. And now, I'll turn the call over to Mark.Oil and gas, Pump, EnergyPhoto by Markus Spiske on UnsplashMark Smith: Thanks, John. Today, I will review our fiscal first quarter 2023 operating results, provide guidance for the second quarter, reiterate full fiscal year 2023 guidance as appropriate and comment on our financial position. Let me start with highlights for the recently completed first quarter ended December 31, 2022. The company generated quarterly results of -- quarterly revenues of $720 million versus $631 million from the previous quarter. As expected, the quarterly increase in revenue was due primarily to focused efforts to move our average North America fleet pricing toward recent leading edge rates. Total direct operating costs were $429 million for the first fiscal quarter versus $412 million for the previous quarter.The sequential increase is attributable to slightly higher average active rig count in North America and the full quarter of the labor-related increase discussed on our November call. General and administrative expenses were approximately $48 million for the first quarter, slightly lower than our expectations. During the first quarter, we recognized a loss of $15 million, primarily related to the fair market value of our ADNOC drilling investment, which is reported as a part of loss on investment securities and our consolidated statement of operations. We also decommissioned eight non-super-spec rigs in Argentina and incurred approximately $12 million in impairment charges primarily related to those Argentina rigs. Our Q1 effective tax rate was approximately 25%, which is within our previously guided range.To summarize this quarter's results, H&amp;P earned a profit of $0.91 per diluted share versus $0.42 in the previous quarter. First quarter earnings per share were negatively impacted by a net $0.20 loss per share of select items, as highlighted in our press release, including the aforementioned loss on investment securities and impairment charges. Absent these select items adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.11 in the first fiscal quarter versus an adjusted $0.45 during the fourth fiscal quarter. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $96 million. Similar to fiscal 2022, we expect the timing of our CapEx spend to vary from quarter-to-quarter. H&amp;P generated approximately $185 million in operating cash flow during the first quarter of 2023, which was generally in line with our expectations.I will have additional comments about our cash and working capital later in these prepared remarks. Turning to our three segments, beginning with the North America Solutions segment. We averaged 180 contracted rigs during the first quarter, up from an average of 176 rigs in fiscal Q4. We exited the first fiscal quarter with 184 contracted rigs, which was in line with our guidance expectations. Revenues increased sequentially by $75 million due to higher average pricing, as mentioned earlier. Segment direct margin was $260 million at the midpoint of our November guidance and sequentially higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022's $204 million. In addition, reactivation costs of $8.6 million were incurred during Q1 compared to $7.5 million in the prior quarter.We had eight net reactivations in Q1, including a 9th reactivation that replaced a loss  the rig lost in the fire that John mentioned earlier. First quarter reactivation costs were related to the deployment of those nine rigs, as well as preparation costs incurred on rigs ready to being ready for deployment in the first few months of calendar 2023. Total segment per day expenses, including re-commissioning costs and excluding reimbursables excluding re-commissioning and excluding reimbursables increased to $16,800 in the first quarter from $16,500 per day in the fourth quarter. This is broadly in line with expectation, primarily due to the previously mentioned labor-related increase that commenced at the beginning of the fiscal year. Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 for North America Solutions.As I mentioned earlier, we ended Q1 at the midpoint of our exit guidance range. The activity level looks to continue to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace than the first quarter, driven in part by public company operators who are working to fulfill their calendar 2023 budget levels. As of today's call we have 185 rigs contracted and we expect to end the second fiscal quarter of 2023, with between 183 and 188 contracted rigs. Just to be clear in revisiting John's comments on our rig count, we have previously stated that, we could add up to 16 rigs and that would get us to a maximum of 192 rigs during the fiscal year, due to the loss of the one rig to a fire that maximum number is 191. So since fiscal year-end through today we have added 10 of the 16 for a net add of nine rigs, with another two slated to go to work over the next few months.Our current revenue backlog from our North America Solutions fleet is roughly $1.1 billion for rigs under term contract. As of today approximately 55% of the US active fleet is on a term contract. As mentioned on our last call, the leading-edge revenue per day was and still is approximately $40,000 inclusive of performance bonus opportunities and technology utilization. By comparison, our average spot revenue per day is currently in the high 30s compared to the Q1 overall average revenue per day of approximately 33,000. This provides us with a line of sight for further increases in average revenue per day over the next few quarters. In the North America Solutions segment, we expect direct margins in fiscal Q2 to range between $280 million to $300 million, inclusive of the effect of about $4 million in reactivation costs.As discussed on our November call, we increased field labor related rates to respond to market conditions at the beginning of fiscal 2023. Labor is approximately 75% of daily operating expenses. We have also experienced increases in maintenance expense, due to pricing inflation of consumable materials and supplies inventory. We believe that, our current labor and materials and supply as costs will be relatively stable for the balance of fiscal 2023, resulting in higher margin accretion as average pricing for the fleet is expected to continue to move towards leading edge. Regarding our International Solutions segment, International Solutions business activity increased by one rig to 13 active rigs at the end of the first fiscal quarter, we added a rig in Argentina as expected, which brings our working rig count to nine in that country.International results came in above guidance, primarily due to delayed timing for costs associated with developing our Middle East hub, including rig preparation and exportation costs. As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal 2023 for international, we will incur costs to reactivate a rig in Bahrain, which we expect to begin working in the middle of the quarter bringing us to two or three rigs working in that country. In the second quarter, we expect to earn $7 million to $10 million in direct margin aside from any foreign exchange impacts. Turning to our Offshore Gulf of Mexico segment, we still have four of our seven offshore platform rigs contracted, and we have active management contracts on three customer-owned rigs two of which are on active rate.Offshore generated a direct margin of $9.5 million during the quarter, which was in line with our estimate. As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal 2023 for the offshore segment, we expect that offshore will again generate between $8 million to $10 million of direct margin. Now, I look at activity in other. You might have noted the increase in our other line this quarter. This was primarily due to an adjustment in our captive insurance company. At the start of fiscal 2020, we elected to set up a wholly-owned insurance captive to finance the deductibles for our workers' compensation, general liability, automobile liability and medical stop-loss insurance programs beginning October 1, 2019 forward Our operating segments pay monthly premiums to the captive for the estimated losses based on external actuarial analysis of historical losses and operating trends.This results in a transfer of risk from our operating subsidiaries, to the captive for the deductibles, which mirrored our self-insurance retention. Insurance premiums are included in operating segment expenses and are included in intersegment sales in the other non-reportable segments. The intercompany premium revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the actuarial estimated underwriting expense was less than recent run rate, as revised developed claim losses were less than reserved. These were adjusted accordingly, creating a positive benefit in the first quarter in other segments. Now let me look forward to the second fiscal quarter, and update full fiscal year 2022 guidance as appropriate -- 2023 guidance, sorry.Capital expenditures for the full fiscal 2023 year, are still expected to range between $425 million to $475 million, with the remaining spend to be incurred over our last three fiscal quarters. Our expectations for general and administrative expenses, for the full fiscal year have not changed and remained at approximately $195 million. We are still estimating our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 28%, with the variance above US statutory rate of 21%, contributed to permanent book-to-tax differences in stated foreign income taxes. We continue to project the fiscal year 2023 cash tax range of $190 million to $240 million, of which as mentioned in November, a portion relates to fiscal 2022 income taxes to be paid in this fiscal year.Now, looking at our financial position. Helmer Campaign, had cash and short-term investments of approximately $348 million at December 31 2022, versus an equivalent $350 million at September 30, 2022. Including availability under our revolving credit facility, our liquidity remains at approximately $1.1 billion. The sequential flat cash balance is largely attributable to our recent share repurchases and seasonal cash outlays, and working capital lockup, which was driven by higher revenue. Our planning shows cash generation and build in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, our general preference is to maintain a minimum of approximately $200 million in cash and short-term investments. The cash and equivalents of $150 million above that minimum, plus the $100 million free cash flow we expect to generate after CapEx and after the base and supplemental dividend, as discussed on our November call, equals $250 million of flexibility for various capital allocation considerations including, accretive investments and returns to shareholders.During the latter half of the first fiscal quarter, we saw a combination of excess liquidity and an attractive opportunity to repurchase some of our shares at prices that we believe to be value accretive. Approximately, 844,000 shares were repurchased in December for approximately $39.1 million under our evergreen annual share repurchase authorization, of four million shares per calendar year. Note, that the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional one million shares in calendar 2023, bringing the total calendar 2023 authorization to five million shares. In calendar 2023, through January 27, we have repurchased approximately 434,000 shares for roughly $20.5 million. So fiscal 2023 repurchases have totaled approximately, 1.28 million shares thus far, for about $60 million and augment our long-standing base dividend and our fiscal 2023 supplemental dividend.Each of these items, stock repurchases and the base and supplemental dividends and encompass the new shareholder return model that we announced in October. These actions combined with our improving financial performance, demonstrate our focus to not only increase the financial returns to the company, such as return on invested capital, but also cash returns provided to shareholders. That concludes our prepared comments for the first fiscal quarter. Let me now turn the call over to Nikki for questions.See also 25 Lowest PE Stocks of S&amp;P 500 Index and 11 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

QuoteSegmental PerformanceNorth America Solutions: During the quarter, operating revenues of $627.2 million were up 83.9% year over year on higher activity levels, with the average number of active rigs rising from 183 to 188. The steep uptick in drilling works on the back of robust oil and gas prices, together with pricing improvements, meant that the segment turned around from the previous year’s operating loss of $28.9 million to a profit of $145.3 million.Offshore Gulf of Mexico: Revenues of $35.2 million increased 20% from the year-ago quarter as activity remained robust. Moreover, margins during the October-December period of 2022 expanded more than 10% year over year, resulting in the segment’s profit improving 23.4% (from the prior-year period) to $6.7 million.Story continuesInternational Solutions: In contrast to the prior quarter's operating loss of $0.8 million, this segment saw operating profitability of $1.6 million. In the absence of an $8.1 million impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the increase in operating income was driven by an increase in revenue days and lower expenses, primarily associated with delayed rig mobilizations.Financial PositionIn the reported quarter, Helmerich &amp; Payne spent $96 million on capital programs. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had $229.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, while long-term debt was $542.9 million (debt-to-capitalization of 16.1).GuidanceThis Tulsa, OK-based company anticipates direct margin in the North America Solutions segment between $280 million and $300 million in the fiscal second quarter.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP).Helmerich &amp; Payne currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 53.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for HPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for HPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Helmerich &amp; Payne here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Helmerich &amp; Payne, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is HP a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Helmerich &amp; Payne, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $4.48.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Helmerich &amp; Payne.

We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q4 and full year 2022 results. We delivered record revenue during the fourth quarter, although total sales of $1.449 billion were slightly below the midpoint of our guidance due to the timing of supply and some logistical challenges at the end of the quarter. Despite these challenges, we achieved a second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. A record performance by our Enterprise business and our second highest Cloud revenue quarter. Our non-GAAP gross and operating margin also exceeded expectations resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, which was above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance.Story continuesOur Q4 results capped a record revenue year for Juniper in 2022, which saw us accelerate our growth despite the challenged global supply chain environment. The diversity of our strength was also a highlight during the year as we grew our Enterprise business by more than 20% year-over-year. We grew our Cloud business by more than 13% year-over-year, and we grew our Service Provider business by approximately 3% year-over-year with the revenue growth for each of these verticals, exceeding the high end of our long-term model. I believe these results speak to the strong execution by our teams, the strength of our portfolio and our ability to win across each of the customer verticals and use cases where we compete. While revenue growth was healthy in Q4 and for the full year of 2022, as we expected, overall demand moderated in the December quarter, with total orders declining more than 20% year-over-year.Although our Enterprise orders were flat year-over-year despite a very difficult comp. This moderation in total orders was primarily driven by a normalization of buying patterns amongst our Cloud and Service Provider customers. This follows a year in which many of these accounts placed multiple quarters of demand in advance of knowing requirements to account for extended lead times. Now that many of these orders placed in prior periods are shipping and with significant orders on the books for the upcoming year, Cloud and Service Provider customers are placing fewer new orders which is a trend we expect to continue through at least the first half of the current year. As this order normalization process continues, we think revenue growth will be the most important metric to gauge customer demand over the next several quarters.I'd like to acknowledge that we are seeing some customers across each of our customer verticals, more closely scrutinize spending plans and deployment time lines due to the economic uncertainties that are happening around the world. Order cancellations continue to remain low and our customers' appetite to receive orders that were placed in prior periods remains high. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to monetize our backlog as supply improves. That said, we're watching these strengths closely and have factored the certainties into our financial outlook. Despite these current macro uncertainties, I remain optimistic regarding our prospects for the upcoming year. Five reasons driving my optimism include: First, our focus on leveraging AI-driven cloud-based automation tools to simplify customer operations and improve the end user experience.What we call Experience First Networking continues to resonate across the customer verticals we serve, whether it be Mist in the campus to Apstra in the data center to Juniper Paragon in the service provider market, these software automation tools are enabling customers to achieve superior scale cost effectively to rapidly identify and remediate network problems in many cases, without the need for human intervention and to accelerate the time line for network deployments. These capabilities deliver tangible value to customers which is enabling us to win in the current market environment and may resonate even more if return on investment plays an increasingly important role in customer decisions. Given our level of portfolio differentiation, balanced against our relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I remain optimistic regarding our ability to grow revenue even in a more challenged macro environment.Second, we continue to invest in our go-to-market organization to capitalize on our product differentiation and take share, particularly in the enterprise. To this point, since the beginning of 2019, we have steadily increased our quota carrying headcount, meaningfully increased our channel presence and invested in both demand generation and modern selling tools that are creating more effect and more wind in the market. While these investments have enabled us to accelerate our growth over the last several years, particularly in the enterprise vertical, they are also continuing to provide tailwinds with deal registration from the channel growing 18% year-over-year and order momentum in the commercial market growing 43% year-over-year in the Q4 time frame.We expect this momentum to continue and further benefit growth in future periods. Third, we continue to see strong 400-gig progress with more than 100 new wins across wide area and data center use cases since our last quarterly update. Many of these wins constitute franchises that are likely to present tailwinds for revenue over a multiyear period. While 400-gig solutions are critical to enabling customers to meet the continuous growth in the network bandwidth, they are also critical for improving the power efficiency and cost of operating network, which we think is likely to add resilience to these important projects. Fourth, we continue to make progress transitioning our business to a more software-centric model. This includes transforming more of our perpetual offerings to term-based licenses, introducing more ratable subscription offerings and training our sales organization to better monetize the value of our software stack.While these efforts remain in the early innings, we experienced encouraging momentum in the Q4 time frame, which saw total software and related services revenue grew 26% year-over-year and accounts for 21% of our total sales. Our annualized recurring revenue, which solely consists of truly ratable software subscriptions and related services increased 43% year-over-year due to strong demand for Mist and certain security subscriptions. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in our software transformation strategy as many of these revenue streams are recurring, pull-through infrastructure and improve margin. Finally, we exited 2022 with an exceptional backlog of more than $2 billion, which is up approximately $200 million from where we entered the year and remains well above historical levels.This backlog is providing us with exceptional revenue visibility and should enable us to deliver another year of healthy growth. Based on our current backlog, customer demand and our assumptions regarding supply, we currently expect to deliver at least 8% revenue growth and at least a point of non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023. Our expectations for 2023 assumes the availability of supply only modestly improves and that the end market environment remains uncertain. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solutions. This business experienced revenue weakness during the fourth quarter due to the timing of supply following very strong shipments during the prior quarter.That said, our automated WAN business grew 12% on a full year basis, which exceeded our expectations and the high-end of our long-term model. We remain optimistic regarding the long-term outlook for our automated win business based on the momentum we're seeing for several of our newer products. To this point, our new 306-based MX 304 and LC 9600 line card continued to perform exceptionally well; with the MX 304 securing 150 new logos in Q4 and emerging as one of our fastest ramping products over the last five years. Our PTX portfolio also continues to perform well across Cloud, Service Provider and Enterprise accounts. In Q4, our PTX platform secured more than 15 new use case wins that we expect collectively will drive more than $200 million of incremental opportunity over the next three to five years.Not to be overlooked, we're continuing to make progress with our new cloud metro portfolio, which saw orders more than double on a year-over-year basis. Our pipeline of opportunities is strong, and we remain encouraged by our ability to win in the market, especially as we add new AI-driven cloud-based automation capabilities to the portfolio over the next few quarters. Our cloud-ready data center revenue experienced an exceptional performance in Q4 and grew more than 20% on a full year basis. 400-gig momentum remains strong, and we now have more than 120 400-gig data center wins that include Cloud majors, large Enterprise and Service Provider accounts. Our Apstra pipeline continues to build as new logos increased meaningfully on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, and we experienced strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software.Network, Connection, TechnologyPhoto by Chris Montgomery on UnsplashInterest in our new Apstra freeform capability, which provides more flexible deployment options and expands the list of potential customers we can address is encouraging, and we plan to introduce new software capabilities that will further expand the use cases we can address in 2023. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio remains healthy. And given the wins we've already secured, I'm optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the attractive growth within this market over the next several years. Our AI-driven enterprise revenue continued to significantly outpace the market, growing more than 30% year-over-year in Q4 and 24% on a full year basis. This strength was led by our mid-to five business, which is the segment of our campus and branch portfolio driven by Mist AI and the cloud.This area saw both revenue and orders grew more than 50% year-over-year, with record sales of AI-driven WiFi and EX switching in the Q4 time frame. On a full year basis, our Mistified revenue was $500 million in 2022, which was up from approximately $300 million in 2021. Our Mistified orders also continued to see strong momentum with fourth quarter results surpassing $900 million on an annualized basis. The industry is clearly recognizing the differentiation of Juniper's campus and branch offerings, driven by Mist AI. We believe this is reflected in Gartner's latest Magic Quadrant for Enterprise wired and wireless LAN infrastructure that was released in December of 2022 where Juniper was named a leader for a third consecutive year and was ranked highest in both completeness of vision and ability to execute for a second consecutive year.Additionally, the Gartner Enterprise wired and wireless LAN infrastructure critical capabilities report that was published in January 2023, Juniper received the top score in four out of five of the use cases. On the product side, we continue to invest heavily in new key areas that drive real value to customers and partners, including WiFi 60 and new AI-driven EX switch variants such as the 41 Hybrid both of which are seeing strong early adoption in the market. We're also continuing to make enhancements to Marvis, the industry's only virtual network assistance driven by Mist AI. Lastly, customer traction for the AI-driven enterprise remains exceptionally strong. For example, we saw a nearly 80% increase in the number of accounts purchasing at least two Mistified products during the most recent year.This highlights the attractiveness of a full stacked Juniper offering managed via common AI engine and cloud as well as the land and expand opportunities available to our sellers and partners, which we believe remains in the early innings. Our security revenue returned to growth in Q4, although we expect this business to be pressured over the next few quarters as we transition from an appliance to a ratable software subscription model. We remain optimistic regarding the long-term outlook for our security business as we believe the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We're also encouraged by the interest in our software security offerings, most notably our Security Director cloud platform.This product provides customers a single policy framework to manage all their firewalls, whether in the data center or at the edge or whether on-premises or in the cloud, which is essential to help customers migrate to Zero Trust and SASE architecture. This platform was recently named CRN Magazine's Edge Platform of the Year and already has secured more than 300 wins, which we view as an encouraging sign of future success. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another record quarter, and our Services business continued to grow year-over-year due to strong renewals and attach rates as well as the growth of our SaaS business. Our customer satisfaction scores remain at all-time highs, and our service margins came in better than expected due to higher revenue and lower costs.On a full year basis, our service margins achieved a new all-time record of 67.3%, up 150 basis points as compared to the prior year. Our Services organization continues to execute extremely well and is focused on driving incremental efficiencies through automation and cloud-delivered insights that not only create new revenue opportunities, but also benefit margin and customer experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss the quarterly and full year financial results in more detail.Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results, then cover our fiscal year 2022 and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with record revenue of $1.449 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. This was below the midpoint of our guidance due to the timing of supply and some of the logistical challenges towards the end of the quarter. Despite the slight revenue shortfall, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 and which was above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by a better-than-expected gross margin result and prudent operating expense management. In terms of product orders, as expected, we saw a decline due to buying patterns normalizing and customers consuming previously placed orders.This was more pronounced with our Cloud and Service Provider customers. We expect this dynamic to continue as supply improves and backlog normalizes. During the fourth quarter, total product orders declined more than 20% year-over-year. Adjusted orders placed to accommodate for the extended lead times, declined single digits year-over-year versus a difficult comparison, but grew sequentially. Our adjusted orders calculation only includes a one-way adjustment to reduce bookings due to accelerated ordering. During the entire time that we've reported adjusted orders, we have not added those orders back into future periods where they would have normally been placed. We believe that if we were to add back those accelerated orders, adjusted orders would have grown in Q4 of 2022.We exited 2022 with backlog of slightly more than $2 billion, which is down sequentially but up approximately $200 million on a year-over-year basis. Looking at our revenue by vertical. Enterprise had record revenue and was our largest vertical in the fourth quarter. increasing 32% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Cloud grew 14% year-over-year and increased 1% sequentially. Service Provider declined 8% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. From a customer solutions perspective, AI-Driven Enterprise revenue grew 30% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. Cloud-ready data center grew 50% year-over-year and 13% sequentially and automated WAN solutions revenue was down 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. The total software and related services revenue was $305 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year.Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 43% year-over-year, and we exited the year with $294 million in ARR. Total security revenue was $169 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, six were Cloud, 3 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 34% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.5% in the quarter, which was above our guidance midpoint, primarily driven by the favorable software mix and to a lesser extent, some improvement in transitory supply chain costs which more than offset an unfavorable product mix. Supply chain continues to be constrained with long lead times and elevated costs.If not for the elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year and was up 1% sequentially, primarily due to headcount-related costs. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $120 million for the quarter. Turning to capital return. We paid $68 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. We also repurchased $88 million worth of shares in the quarter. Moving on to our full year results. Our revenue for 2022 was a record, coming in at $5.301 billion, which is 12% growth versus 2021. Despite the impact of supply chain constraints, we saw growth across all verticals, customer solutions and geographies.Our Enterprise business became our largest vertical and grew 21%. Our Cloud business grew 13%, while Service Provider grew 3% year-over-year. From a customer solutions perspective, AI-driven enterprise revenue increased 24% and Cloud-ready data center revenue grew 21% and automated WAN solutions revenue grew 12% on a full year basis. Total software and related services revenue was $994 million, which was an increase of 31% year-over-year. This exceeded our expectations as we continue to make meaningful progress in transitioning our business to more of a software and SaaS-centric model. Total security revenue was $629 million, which was down 4% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, six were Cloud, three were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise.Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of our total 2022 revenue as compared to 31% in 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.4%, a decline of 230 basis points versus 2021, primarily due to the product mix and increased supply chain costs. If not for elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60% in 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year primarily due to higher headcount-related costs. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.95 in 2022, an increase of 12% versus 2021. During 2022, we repurchased $300 million worth of shares and paid $270 million in dividends. I am very pleased with our financial performance, both in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website.At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect first quarter revenue of $1.34 billion, which is 15% growth year-over-year. We are still experiencing supply chain-related headwinds associated with shortages as well as elevated components and freight costs, which are expected to modestly improve through the course of 2023. First quarter non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be down sequentially to 57% due to a normalized software mix and seasonality. We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily driven by the typical seasonal increase of fringe costs. Despite these increases, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase more than 100 basis points versus Q1 2022. Turning to our expectations for the full year 2023.Given the ongoing customer demand for product, solid exiting backlog and improved supply, we're updating our revenue growth expectations for 2023 from at least 7% to at least 8%. Beyond the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to grow sequentially throughout the course of the year. This assumes the current supply chain environment modestly improves but remains challenged. This forecast as soon as we reduced backlog during the course of the year. However, we expect to exit the year with elevated backlog compared to historical normal levels. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be flat to slightly up year-over-year. We remain committed to disciplined expense management and full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to expand by at least 100 basis points versus 2022.That said, we will continue to invest to take advantage of market opportunities and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be up on a full year basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow double digits on a full year basis. Finally, I'm pleased to announce we have declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. See also 10 Best February Dividend Stocks To Buy  and 10 Hot Oil Stocks To Buy .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

No doubt, it’s a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like Coca Cola Femsa KOF, United Rentals URI, and Ameriprise Financial AMP have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening ParametersIn order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Story continues• Zacks Rank equal to #1No matter whether the market is good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 have a proven history of outperformance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Nucor Corp. NUE, Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD, United Rentals Inc. URI and Ameriprise Financial Inc. AMP.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Momentum Stock for February After a Strong JanuaryWall Street ended the first month of 2023 with a solid rally after a highly disappointing 2022. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — appreciated 2.8%, 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 closed their third positive month in four. The S&amp;P 500 posted the best January since 2019. The Nasdaq Composite ended the best month since July and the best January since 2001.Favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic data and a resilient labor market raised market participants’ hope for a soft landing of the U.S. economy. At this stage, it should be profitable to invest in momentum stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Five such stocks are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Nucor Corp., Steel Dynamics Inc.,United Rentals Inc. and Ameriprise Financial Inc.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Story continuesPeak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five momentum stocks. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions over the last seven days, which indicates that the market is expecting these companies to do solid business in 2023. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Momentum Score of A.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer-Daniels-Midland Steady growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth going forward.

URI has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals.

TECK and United Rentals URI.5 PEG-Based Value Stocks to Pick for Your Portfolio NowIn a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register a 20.1% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2021. This favorably compares with a 10.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period.Several other stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here we discuss five such stocks — Archer Daniels Midland, Conagra Brands, Albertsons Companies, Teck Resources Ltd. and United Rentals.More on Value InvestingWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider the price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales (P/S) or price/book value (P/B).This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.Story continuesThe PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate.A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are five out of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Archer Daniels: Illinois-based Archer Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products. The company processes oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa and other feedstuffs. Moreover, it engages in the manufacturing, sale and distribution of products like natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products as well as other specialty food and feed ingredients.Archer Daniels has a long-term historical growth rate of 23.5%. AN currently carries a Zacks Rank of 1 and has a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conagra: Chicago-based Conagra is one of the leading branded food companies in North America. The company offers premium edible products, with a refined focus on innovation. Some iconic brands of the company are Reddi-Wip, Hunt's, Healthy Choice, Frontera, Slim Jim, Blake's and Marie Callender.Conagra currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of B. CAG also has an impressive five-year expected growth rate of 7%.Albertsons Companies: Headquartered in Boise, ID, Albertsons Companies, Inc. is one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States. Albertsons Companies, with its robust local and national presence, occupies a prominent position in the industry and offers grocery products, general merchandise, health and beauty care products, pharmacy, fuel and other items and services.Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, ACI currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of A. Albertsons Companies 2023 expected revenue growth rate is 7.8%.Teck Resources: Vancouver, Canada-based Teck Resources is a diversified resource company committed to mining and mineral development with business units focused on steelmaking coal, copper, zinc and energy.

385,e1e78b50-eeb5-3cc8-9a80-23301060523e,URI,2023-02-03,5 PEG-Based Value Stocks to Pick for Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-peg-based-value-stocks-124912465.html,1675342152,STORY,"['URI', 'TECK', 'ADM', 'ACI', 'CAG']","[In a market dealing with external shocks, value investing is fast gaining popularity. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register a 20.1% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2021. This favorably compares with a 10.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period.Several other stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here we discuss five such stocks — Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Conagra Brands CAG, Albertsons Companies ACI, Teck Resources Ltd TECK and United Rentals URI.More on Value InvestingWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider the price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales (P/S) or price/book value (P/B).This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate.A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.Story continuesWhile P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purposes)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20-Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.Here are five out of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Archer Daniels: Illinois-based Archer Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

Executives have assured regulators that TikTok is implementing strict security protocols, but that trust has been eroded by a number of high-profile scandals, including the inappropriate access of US users’ data by ByteDance employees.The center, which doesn’t directly address the China question, nevertheless aims to help outsiders understand how the app works, with various stations including touch screens that illustrate how its algorithm and content moderation tools operate. One installment, for instance, gives visitors a chance to experience the decision-making process for a TikTok moderator who is presented with a type of content that has been reported to the company for potentially violating policies.At the center, TikTok aims to answer basic questions about the app’s inner workings for people who might have a say in its future — like politicians, regulators, data privacy experts and journalists.The company is also updating its rules around account suspensions, adding a new strikes system that means users who continually violate the same rule or abuse the same feature on the app will face a permanent ban.Story continuesOn Tuesday, journalists invited to tour the facility heard from Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas, who has represented TikTok’s interests in the US and has previously been called to testify before Congress. She emphasized that building consumer trust is a top priority. “This is an area of commitment for us,” she said. “You’ll often hear about it whether you work inside or outside the company as this being our No. 1 priority.”Yet during the 40-minute presentation, which included perspectives from three other executives, none specifically addressed China or discussed other recent security vulnerabilities. Beyond the bills in Congress, TikTok is undergoing an intensive US national security review.TikTok has argued for years that its user data is secure, but has also developed a own plan to dispel those concerns and satisfy US authorities. The company is now taking an aggressive approach to promote the strategy to the public.Known as Project Texas, the plan includes a partnership with Oracle Corp. to store all of its US user data. There will also be a series of regular third-party audits and reviews to ensure the company is adhering to its promises. TikTok previously stored US user data on servers in Singapore and Virgina, a spokesperson said, and is in the process of deleting that data now that it has been copied over to Oracle servers.Without mentioning China, executives did tout Project Texas, saying the company has already spent $1.5 billion on the privacy plan and estimates it will cost between $700 million and $1 billion annually once it is fully operational.One door was off limits to the media at the Transparency Center: a secure server room where third-party vendors or partners, like Oracle, could come and review TikTok’s code, according to a spokesperson. In order to cross the threshold, one would need to sign a non-disclosure agreement.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Gets an MBAWhen Financial Bubbles Are Hard to PopThat Zoom Meeting Really Could Have Been a Simple Phone CallA Billionaire’s Son Battles a Turbulent WWE Over the Future of Pro WrestlingWhen Hackers Hobbled Ireland’s Hospitals, They Took Themselves Down, Too©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

In the last week, 3 estimates have been cut for 2022, pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $4.50 from $4.61. That's still above the range.At $4.50, that's an earnings decline of 14% from last year.3 estimates were also cut for 2023, pushing the 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $4.92 from $5.00. But that would be an earnings rebound of 9.2%.Layoffs and Cost SavingsHasbro also announced leadership and organization changes, including eliminating 1,000 jobs, or approximately 15% of its global workforce.

(NASDAQ:HAS) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 83% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$489m. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 33% for shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Hasbro which might hurt individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Hasbro, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Hasbro ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Hasbro?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Hasbro. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Hasbro's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Hasbro. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 5.2% of the stock. Alan Hassenfeld, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chairman Emeritus.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of HasbroThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Hasbro, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$482m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 10% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Hasbro. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Hasbro better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Hasbro   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

MCD, Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM and Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI.Industry: RestaurantsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2047522/3-restaurant-stocks-to-buy-despite-industry-challengesThe Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry has been impacted by high wages and food cost inflation. Rising prices are also hurting the industry’s traffic. These factors have been affecting margins of late. However, the gradual improvement in demand, menu innovation, robust off-premise sales, sales-building efforts and digital initiatives bode well. Stocks like, McDonald's Corp., Yum! Brands, Inc. and Darden Restaurants, Inc. are well-poised to counter the scenario.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry comprises several owners and operators of casual, upscale casual, fine dining, full-service and fast-casual restaurants. Some industry participants operate as roasters, marketers and retailers of specialty coffee. Some companies develop, operate, and franchise quick-service restaurants worldwide.A few restaurant operators offer cooked-to-order dishes, which include noodles and pasta, soups, salads and appetizers. Some industry players develop, own, operate, manage, and license restaurants and lounges worldwide. A few companies also operate technology-enabled Japanese restaurants in the United States and provide Japanese cuisine through a revolving sushi service model.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Restaurant IndustryTraffic Woes &amp; High Costs Linger: The restaurant industry has been facing declining traffic for quite some time now. A rapid increase in menu prices and coronavirus are the primary reasons behind traffic erosion. Restaurant operators are grappling with the high cost of operations. Intense competition, high wages and food cost inflation remain concerns.The industry is persistently bearing increased expenses, which have been affecting margins. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives are exerting pressure on the company’s margins. The rise in meat and seafood costs, including ribs, prime rib, ribeye and tri-tip and salmon, is hurting the industry.Story continuesSales Declined in December: Per the industry body, the National Restaurant Association (NRA), restaurant sales declined in December to $88.3 billion compared with $89.2 billion generated in November. The association also said that October and November sales were $1.6 billion lower than preliminary numbers reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.Digitalization to Drive Growth: Restaurant operators’ focus on digital innovation, sales-building initiatives and cost-saving efforts has been acting as a catalyst. With the growing influence of the Internet, digital innovation has become the need of the hour. Restaurant operators are constantly partnering with delivery channels and digital platforms to drive incremental sales. Partnerships with delivery channels like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats and the rollout of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs continue to drive growth.Restaurant operators are focusing on driverless delivery systems to augment sales amid the coronavirus crisis. This is anticipated to reduce expenses substantially and ensure safety amid the pandemic as companies do away with delivery personnel.Off-Premise Sales Acting as a Key Catalyst: The industry has been gaining from the increase in off-premise sales, which primarily include delivery, takeout, drive-thru, catering, meal kits, and off-site options such as kiosks and food trucks, owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Per the National Restaurant Association, more than 60% of restaurant foods are consumed off-premise. By 2025, off-premise will likely account for approximately 80% of the industry’s growth.Most restaurant operators have initiated testing of ghost or virtual kitchens. The idea of providing off-premise offerings along with a connected curbside service has been garnering positive customer feedback.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal ProspectsThe Zacks Gaming industry is grouped within the broader Retail-Wholesale sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #161, which places it in the bottom 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

Net income per share, adjusted for certain items, increased 5% to $3.89, including an unfavorable impact of $0.09 per share if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates (""foreign currency translation""), compared to $3.71 in the prior year period. Certain items that impacted fourth quarter results and comparisons with the prior year period are detailed in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Story continues""In the fourth quarter, our colleagues delivered 5% organic revenue growth, to finish a very strong year, contributing to full year organic revenue growth of 6%, margin expansion of 70 basis points to 30.8%, EPS growth of 12% to $13.39, and over $3 billion of free cash flow, an all-time high."" said Greg Case, Chief Executive Officer. ""These results continue our long-term progress and demonstrate the success of our Aon United strategy as we enter 2023 in a position of strength to continue delivering results for clients, colleagues, and shareholders.""FOURTH QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL SUMMARYTotal revenue in the fourth quarter increased 2% to $3.1 billion compared to the prior year period reflecting 5% organic revenue growth and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased 1% to $2.1 billion compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth and investments in long-term growth, partially offset by a $102 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Foreign currency translation in the fourth quarter had a $20 million, or $0.10 per share, unfavorable impact on U.S. GAAP net income and a $19 million, or $0.09 per share, unfavorable impact on adjusted net income. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, the Company would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.13 per share, or an approximately $39 million decrease in adjusted operating income, in the first quarter of 2023, and an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.12 per share, or an approximately $36 million decrease in adjusted operating income, for full year 2023.Effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 6.1%, compared to 15.7% in the prior year period, primarily driven by changes in the geographical distribution of income and a net favorable impact from discrete items. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased to 9.0% compared to 12.2% in the prior year period. The primary drivers of the change in the adjusted tax rate were the geographical distribution of income and a net favorable impact from discrete items. The prior year period also included a net favorable impact from discrete items. These adjustments are discussed in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 209.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to 221.2 million in the prior year period. The Company repurchased 2.3 million class A ordinary shares for approximately $675 million in the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $6.0 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.FULL YEAR 2022 CASH FLOW SUMMARYThe full year 2022 cash flow summary provided below includes supplemental information related to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow"" on page 9 of this press release.Cash flows provided by operations for 2022 increased $1,037 million, or 48%, to $3,219 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the transaction costs in the prior year period, and strong operating income growth, partially offset by higher incentive compensation payments following strong performance in 2021.Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, increased 48%, to $3,023 million in 2022 compared to the prior year, reflecting an increase in cash flows from operations, partially offset by a $59 million increase in capital expenditures, due primarily to ongoing investments in Aon Business Services-enabled technology platforms and technology to drive long-term-growth.FOURTH QUARTER 2022 REVENUE REVIEWThe fourth quarter revenue reviews provided below include supplemental information related to organic revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow"" on page 9 of this press release.Three Months Ended December 31,(millions)20222021% ChangeLess:CurrencyImpactLess:FiduciaryInvestmentIncomeLess: Acquisitions, Divestitures &amp; OtherOrganicRevenueGrowthCommercial Risk Solutions$ 1,822$ 1,847(1) %(4) %1 %(2) %4 %Reinsurance Solutions28122227(3)7149Health Solutions6786514(3)——7Wealth Solutions353364(3)(6)—(3)6Elimination(4)(4)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$ 3,130$ 3,0802 %(4) %1 %— %5 %Total revenue increased $50 million, or 2%, to $3,130 million, compared to the prior year period, including organic revenue growth of 5% driven by ongoing strong retention, net new business generation, and management of the renewal book portfolio, and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Commercial Risk Solutions organic revenue growth of 4% reflects growth across most major geographies driven by strong retention, net new business generation, and management of the renewal book portfolio. Growth in retail brokerage was highlighted by double-digit growth in Canada and Latin America, driven by continued strength in core P&amp;C. U.S. retail brokerage was pressured primarily by Transaction Solutions, which declined due to lower external deal volume. Results also reflect double-digit growth in the affinity business across both consumer and business solutions, including growth in the travel and events practice and Digital Client Solutions. On average globally, exposures and pricing were modestly positive, resulting in modestly positive market impact.Reinsurance Solutions organic revenue growth of 9% reflects double-digit growth in both the Strategy and Technology Group and facultative placements. Market impact was modestly positive on results in the quarter. The majority of revenue in our treaty portfolio is recurring in nature and is recorded in connection with the major renewal periods that take place throughout the first half of the year, while the second half of the year is largely driven by facultative placements and capital markets that are more transactional in nature.Health Solutions organic revenue growth of 7% reflects growth globally in core health and benefits brokerage, driven by strong retention, new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio. Growth in the core was highlighted by double-digit growth in Latin America, U.K., and Asia Pacific. Results also reflect double-digit growth in Human Capital, driven by data and advisory solutions, and modest growth in Consumer Benefits Solutions.Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth of 6% reflects growth in Retirement, driven by higher demand and project-related work related to pension risk transfer and ongoing impacts of regulatory changes. In Investments, a decrease in AUM-based delegated investment management revenue due to equity market and interest rate movements was partially offset by higher advisory demand and project-related work.FOURTH QUARTER 2022 EXPENSE REVIEWThree Months Ended December 31,(millions)20222021$ Change% ChangeExpensesCompensation and benefits$ 1,539$ 1,556$ (17)(1) %Information technology1381182017Premises7376(3)(4)Depreciation of fixed assets3641(5)(12)Amortization and impairment of intangible assets2635(9)(26)Other general expense306280269Total operating expenses$ 2,118$ 2,106$ 121 %Compensation and benefits expense decreased $17 million, or 1%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $79 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth.Information technology expense increased $20 million, or 17%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to ongoing investments in Aon Business Services-enabled technology platforms and technology to drive long-term-growth.Premises expense decreased $3 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $5 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $5 million, or 12%, compared to the prior year period.Amortization and impairment of intangible assets decreased $9 million, or 26%, compared to the prior year period.Other general expense increased $26 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth, including an increase in business travel expense.FOURTH QUARTER 2022 INCOME SUMMARYCertain noteworthy items impacted adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margins in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, which are also described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Three Months Ended December 31,(millions)20222021%  ChangeRevenue$ 3,130$ 3,0802 %Expenses2,1182,1061 %Operating income$ 1,012$ 9744 %Operating margin32.3 %31.6 %Operating income - as adjusted$ 1,038$ 1,0093 %Operating margin - as adjusted33.2 %32.8 %Operating income increased $38 million, or 4%, and operating margin increased 70 basis points to 32.3%, each compared to the prior year period.

The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made.

Further information concerning Aon and its businesses, including factors that potentially could materially affect Aon's financial results, is contained in Aon's filings with the SEC. See Aon's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to Aon and its businesses. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Aon is not under, and expressly disclaims, any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Explanation of Non-GAAP MeasuresThis communication includes supplemental information not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""), including organic revenue growth, free cash flow, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted net income per share, and adjusted effective tax rate that exclude the effects of intangible asset amortization and impairment, pension settlements, capital expenditures, and certain other noteworthy items that affected results for the comparable periods. Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, fiduciary investment income, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. Currency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations to the closest U.S. GAAP measure for each non-GAAP measure presented in this communication are provided in the attached appendices. Supplemental organic revenue growth information and additional measures that exclude the effects of certain items noted above do not affect net income or any other U.S. GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flows from operating activity less capital expenditures. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for estimated intangible asset amortization and impairment, and certain other noteworthy items. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. Non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, Aon's Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.Investor Contact:Media Contact:Leslie FollmerNadine Youssef+1 312-381-3310+1 312-381-3024investor.relations@aon.commediainquiries@aon.comAon plcConsolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)Three Months Ended December 31,Twelve Months Ended December 31,(millions, except per share data)20222021%Change20222021%ChangeRevenueTotal revenue$ 3,130$ 3,0802 %$ 12,479$ 12,1932 %ExpensesCompensation and benefits1,5391,556(1) %6,4776,738(4) %Information technology13811817 %5094777 %Premises7376(4) %289327(12) %Depreciation of fixed assets3641(12) %151179(16) %Amortization and impairment of intangible assets2635(26) %113147(23) %Other general expense3062809 %1,2712,235(43) %Total operating expenses2,1182,1061 %8,81010,103(13) %Operating income1,0129744 %3,6692,09076 %Interest income3250 %181164 %Interest expense(110)(85)29 %(406)(322)26 %Other income (expense)(196)145(235) %(125)152(182) %Income before income taxes7091,036(32) %3,1561,93163 %Income tax expense (1)43163(74) %510623(18) %Net income666873(24) %2,6461,308102 %Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests910(10) %57538 %Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$ 657$ 863(24) %$ 2,589$ 1,255106 %Basic net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$ 3.17$ 3.94(20) %$ 12.23$ 5.59119 %Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$ 3.14$ 3.90(19) %$ 12.14$ 5.55119 %Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - basic207.5219.3(5) %211.7224.7(6) %Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted209.3221.2(5) %213.2226.1(6) %(1)The effective tax rate was 6.1% and 15.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 16.2% and 32.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Aon plcReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow (Unaudited)Organic Revenue Growth (Unaudited)Three Months Ended December 31,(millions)20222021% ChangeLess: Currency Impact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures &amp; OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (3)Commercial Risk Solutions$ 1,822$ 1,847(1) %(4) %1 %(2) %4 %Reinsurance Solutions28122227(3)7149Health Solutions6786514(3)——7Wealth Solutions353364(3)(6)—(3)6Elimination(4)(4)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$ 3,130$ 3,0802 %(4) %1 %— %5 %Twelve Months Ended December 31,(millions)20222021% ChangeLess: Currency Impact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures &amp; OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (3)Commercial Risk Solutions$ 6,715$ 6,6351 %(4) %1 %(2) %6 %Reinsurance Solutions2,1901,99710(3)148Health Solutions2,2242,1543(3)—(2)8Wealth Solutions1,3671,426(4)(5)—(2)3Elimination(17)(19)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$ 12,479$ 12,1932 %(4) %]"

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AON in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.73 per share for AON, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.67 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AON, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.52%  heading into earnings season.Aon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc price-eps-surprise | Aon plc QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that AON has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

MCD, Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM and Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI.Industry: RestaurantsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2047522/3-restaurant-stocks-to-buy-despite-industry-challengesThe Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry has been impacted by high wages and food cost inflation. Rising prices are also hurting the industry’s traffic. These factors have been affecting margins of late. However, the gradual improvement in demand, menu innovation, robust off-premise sales, sales-building efforts and digital initiatives bode well. Stocks like, McDonald's Corp., Yum! Brands, Inc. and Darden Restaurants, Inc. are well-poised to counter the scenario.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry comprises several owners and operators of casual, upscale casual, fine dining, full-service and fast-casual restaurants. Some industry participants operate as roasters, marketers and retailers of specialty coffee. Some companies develop, operate, and franchise quick-service restaurants worldwide.A few restaurant operators offer cooked-to-order dishes, which include noodles and pasta, soups, salads and appetizers. Some industry players develop, own, operate, manage, and license restaurants and lounges worldwide. A few companies also operate technology-enabled Japanese restaurants in the United States and provide Japanese cuisine through a revolving sushi service model.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Restaurant IndustryTraffic Woes &amp; High Costs Linger: The restaurant industry has been facing declining traffic for quite some time now. A rapid increase in menu prices and coronavirus are the primary reasons behind traffic erosion. Restaurant operators are grappling with the high cost of operations. Intense competition, high wages and food cost inflation remain concerns.The industry is persistently bearing increased expenses, which have been affecting margins. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives are exerting pressure on the company’s margins. The rise in meat and seafood costs, including ribs, prime rib, ribeye and tri-tip and salmon, is hurting the industry.Story continuesSales Declined in December: Per the industry body, the National Restaurant Association (NRA), restaurant sales declined in December to $88.3 billion compared with $89.2 billion generated in November. The association also said that October and November sales were $1.6 billion lower than preliminary numbers reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.Digitalization to Drive Growth: Restaurant operators’ focus on digital innovation, sales-building initiatives and cost-saving efforts has been acting as a catalyst. With the growing influence of the Internet, digital innovation has become the need of the hour. Restaurant operators are constantly partnering with delivery channels and digital platforms to drive incremental sales. Partnerships with delivery channels like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats and the rollout of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs continue to drive growth.Restaurant operators are focusing on driverless delivery systems to augment sales amid the coronavirus crisis. This is anticipated to reduce expenses substantially and ensure safety amid the pandemic as companies do away with delivery personnel.Off-Premise Sales Acting as a Key Catalyst: The industry has been gaining from the increase in off-premise sales, which primarily include delivery, takeout, drive-thru, catering, meal kits, and off-site options such as kiosks and food trucks, owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Per the National Restaurant Association, more than 60% of restaurant foods are consumed off-premise. By 2025, off-premise will likely account for approximately 80% of the industry’s growth.Most restaurant operators have initiated testing of ghost or virtual kitchens. The idea of providing off-premise offerings along with a connected curbside service has been garnering positive customer feedback.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal ProspectsThe Zacks Gaming industry is grouped within the broader Retail-Wholesale sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #161, which places it in the bottom 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Since Aug 31, 2022, the industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 0.7%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms the S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past year.Over this period, the industry has increased 4.7%, compared with the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s decrease of 14%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Expedia Group EXPE, Booking Holdings BKNG, BigCommerce BIGC and TripAdvisor TRIP.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 E-Commerce Stocks Set to Beat Q4 Earnings EstimatesE-commerce stocks continued to suffer from unfavorable market dynamics during fourth-quarter 2022.These stocks suffered since the pandemic-induced e-commerce boom has been cooling off in the past few quarters with the reopening of economies across the world. Further, the slowdown in consumer spending due to high inflation remained a concern. Also, e-commerce companies witnessed the brunt of inflationary pressure in the form of rising transportation and fulfillment expenses. Additionally, supply-chain constraints and labor shortages were overhangs.Nevertheless, solid momentum during the holiday season and record-high e-commerce sales are likely to have been a major tailwind.According to data from Adobe Analytics, consumers spent a staggering $211.7 billion on online purchases between Nov 1 and Dec 31, up 3.5% on a year-over-year basis. This marked a new record for e-commerce sales. Cyber week recorded $35.3 billion in online sales, up 4% year over year.Increasing demand for ultra-fast and door-to-door delivery of orders for essentials, medicines, groceries and luxury items is expected to have contributed well.Additionally, the impacts of the growing proliferation of Internet use and online payment apps globally are expected to be reflected in the e-commerce companies’ results for the quarter under review.Apart from online retail companies, the Internet-Commerce industry houses online travel booking companies. These stocks are expected to have continued gaining on the boom in the travel industry. Relaxation of travel restrictions and growing confidence among the people are expected to have bolstered bookings of online travel stocks during the fourth quarter. Moreover, increased consumer demand for travel industry-related services might have been a positive.Story continuesHow to Make the Right Pick?With the presence of several industry participants, finding the right e-commerce stocks with the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting.

The continuous interest rate hikes have made investors anxious about the stock market’s future. According to Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in January, investors broadly gave a pessimistic view of the market. However, over half of the respondents showed an inclination toward cheaper value stocks, considering their outperformance over growth equities in 2022.

Moreover, high fuel costs are restricting bottom-line growth.Despite the above-mentioned challenges, we believe that the space still has fuel left in the tank, especially for operators that target growth opportunities and operating efficiency initiatives. Even though economies are reopening, consumers’ thirst for online shopping is rampant. The still impressive e-commerce demand scenario is a huge positive for the industry participants. High shipping rates should also drive revenues. In view of these favorable developments surrounding the space, we advise investors to focus on United Parcel Service, FedEx and Air Transport Services Group.About the IndustryThe companies housed in the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry provide air delivery and freight services. Most players in the space are involved in offering specialized transportation and logistics services. Some participants offer a range of supply-chain solutions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, fulfillment, returns, financial transactions and repairs.The well-being of the companies in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the health of the economy. Leading industry players, including UPS, transport millions of packages each day across the globe. Apart from operating a ground fleet of multiple vehicles, some of these companies maintain an air fleet. While some players focus on providing air transportation services for passengers and cargo, others deliver services to entities that outsource air-cargo lifting requirements.Story continues3 Key Trends to Watch in the Transportation-Air Freight &amp; Cargo IndustryStrong Financial Returns for Shareholders: With economic activities gaining pace, more and more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile by way of dividends and buybacks to pacify the long-suffering shareholders, thereby underlining their financial strength and confidence in business. Among the Transportation – Air Freight and Cargo industry players, UPS announced a 6.6% hike in its quarterly dividend in January 2023, apart from unveiling a new share buyback program.E-commerce A Key Catalyst: It is hardly surprising that the pace of growth of e-commerce demand has slowed from the levels witnessed at the peak of the pandemic. Despite the slowdown as economies re-open, the same remains impressive, driven by the convenience associated with-line shopping. The race to digitization also supports the momentum in e-commerce growth.  E-commerce demand strength should continue to support growth of the industry players. Favorable pricing will also bear good news for the industry players.Supply-Chain Woes &amp; High Costs a Downside: Supply-chain disturbances and a tight labor market are ailing the Air Freight and Cargo Industry players. Higher labor and transportation costs are aggravating their woes. Shortage of labor impaired their ability to meet high demand. Costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to supply-chain troubles.The spike in fuel costs is also increasing the operating expenses of the industry players. Even though oil price has declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high. Notably, oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. Naturally, operating expenses are on the way up given the rise in fuel cost.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #101. This rank places it in the top 40% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining in confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate for 2023 has increased 19.7% on a year-over-year basis.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that investors can retain in their portfolios, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has decreased 24.3% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s depreciation of 13% and the broader sector’s decline of 14.6%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), a commonly used multiple for valuing Transportation-Air Freight and Cargo stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.97X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.15X. It is also lower than the sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 10.66X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 13.37X, as low as 6.56X and at the median of 9.79X.3 Transportation-Air Freight and Cargo Stocks to Keep a Tab OnUPS: The rapid e-commerce growth rate in the current scenario is a huge plus for Atlanta-based UPS, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Robust free cash flow generation by UPS is a major positive, leading to an uptick in its shareholder-friendly activities.UPS earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters.UPS shares have gained 9.8% over the past three months.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FedEx: FDX’s efforts to reward its shareholders even in these difficult times are praiseworthy. In June 2022, FedEx raised its quarterly dividend by 53% to $1.15 per share (or $4.60 annually). FDX is also active on the buyback front. During fiscal 2022, FedEx repurchased shares worth $2.2 billion. FedEx's liquidity position is also solid.FDX’s efforts to cut costs are driving its bottom line. Despite the global weakness, FDX's second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings per share came above expectations. Moreover, the top line was favorably impacted by yield improvement and higher fuel surcharges. FDX shares have gained 20.6% over the past three months. FDX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Air Transport Services Group: Wilmington, OH-based ATSG is a leading provider of aircraft leasing, and air-cargo transportation and related services globally. Over the past 60 days, Air Transport Services, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 being raised by 2.5%.The strength in e-commerce demand is a tailwind for Air Transport Services Group. ATSG is well-served by the buoyant demand for midsize freighters.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Persona OsseoTi is the latest addition to the clinically proven Persona Knee System, and features a new porous version of the Persona anatomic tibia with Zimmer Biomet's OsseoTi Porous Metal Technology, offering a comprehensive single system solution for a cementless or cemented application.Presentation of one-year data from a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of mymobility® with Apple Watch, a first-of-its-kind remote care management platform. The data show that using mymobility with Apple Watch following primary knee arthroplasty can effectively guide rehabilitation, demonstrate similar outcomes to traditional care models, and significantly reduce the number of outpatient physical therapy visits. In addition, use of mymobility with Apple Watch was associated with significantly fewer surgery-related emergency department visits, which could translate to lower costs of care.Reached a definitive agreement to acquire Embody, Inc., a privately-held medical device company focused on soft tissue healing, to include Embody's complete portfolio of collagen-based biointegrative solutions to support healing in the most challenging orthopedic soft tissue injuries – including the TAPESTRY® biointegrative implant for tendon healing and TAPESTRY® RC, one of the first arthroscopic implant systems for rotator cuff repair.

restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives; acquisition, integration, divestiture and related; and certain legal and tax matters.  We have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts.  For example, the timing of certain transactions is difficult to predict because management's plans may change.  In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors.  It is probable that these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding financial guidance, the continuation, recovery and/or stabilization of the COVID-19 pandemic and macro pressures, including the impact on our business, and any statements about our forecasts, expectations, plans, intentions, strategies or prospects.

ZBH may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Zimmer Biomet is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ZBH in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.86 per share for ZBH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ZBH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.32% heading into earnings season.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that ZBH has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Zimmer Biomet, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The continuous interest rate hikes have made investors anxious about the stock market’s future. According to Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in January, investors broadly gave a pessimistic view of the market. However, over half of the respondents showed an inclination toward cheaper value stocks, considering their outperformance over growth equities in 2022. In addition to this, companies that have proven track records of dividend growth also made it to investors’ choice.Value stocks showed their greatest performance last year against growth equities since 2000, as reported by Bloomberg. Analysts expect the trend of value investing to continue this year as higher interest rates put margin pressures on the technology sector. Moreover, last year’s selloff was the worst for tech stocks since 2008, so investors are moving toward defensive quality stocks to stay afloat during this period. In this regard, dividend stocks regained their appeal, with dividend payments reaching their record high in 2022. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, compared with $511.2 billion in 2021. The report also mentioned that 373 companies in the S&amp;P 500 raised their dividend through December 15, up from 353 in 2021. These results show that companies have the sufficient cash flow to fulfill their shareholder obligation smoothly.AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) are some of the popular dividend companies that are gaining popularity among investors. These companies not only have raised their dividends for years but also have strong cash generation that promises further growth in the future. Given this, we will discuss the cheapest dividend aristocrats in this article.Story continues15 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right NowPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below belong to the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats, the companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more.

We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Shelly Hubbard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Shelly Hubbard: Thank you, Kate, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call with me are John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Fishman, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year performance as outlined in this morning's press release. On the Pentair Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings release and slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures that we will reference. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Pentair. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and today's release.Story continuesWe will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a follow-up, then re-enter the queue in order to allow everyone an opportunity to ask questions. I will now turn the call over to John.John Stauch: Thank you, Shelly, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with Slide 4, titled Executive Summary. We closed out 2022 with strong sales, segment income and adjusted EPS, which is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our focused employees across the world. Sales increased 9% to $4.1 billion; segment income rose 12% to $768 million; ROS expanded by 40 basis points to 18.6%; and adjusted EPS increased 8% to $3.68. A few of our key wins during the year include: strategic progress on our transformation initiatives, which we expect to drive significant margin expansion over the next several years; the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice, a complementary and accretive acquisition which further enhances our commercial water solutions business; and recognition for our leadership in social responsibility and sustainability.All in, we are focused on building the Pentair in the future by investing in sustainable growth and expanding profitability through strengthening our operational and financial foundation, which we expect to create long-term value for our stakeholders. Bob will discuss our first quarter and full year 2023 guidance in more detail, but I wanted to share some thoughts. We are confident in our business model, diversified portfolio and our transformation initiatives, which we expect to drive long-term shareholder value and contribute significantly to 2023. As we look specifically at 2023, we are working through near-term macroeconomic-driven challenges, which we are driving -- which is driving lower-than-expected volumes in our residential businesses.However, we expect to see more normalized demand in 2024 and view 2023 as a catch-up year for excess demand that was realized in 2020 through the first half of 2022. Please turn to Slide 5, titled 5 Year Pentair Performance. Reflecting on the last five years is a focused, smart, sustainable water solutions company. We drove strong financial performance by: increasing revenue at an 8% compounded annual growth rate; increasing EPS at a 14% compounded annual growth rate; and we have also generated over $2 billion of free cash flow; and ended 2022 with nearly a 16% ROIC. These are metrics that we are very proud of and share with our incredible team here at Pentair. This is a testament to our relentless efforts to deliver premium quality, innovative products and services to our consumers.We believe the largest opportunity is improving ROS, which did not improve materially over the last five years. The strong demand we realized later in 2020 through the first half of 2022 came with disrupted supply chains and unprecedented inflation that was hard to outpace. We believe our second half of 2022 demonstrates that we have finally made progress on price versus cost. However, we still have significant opportunities to improve our operating and cost efficiencies across all of Pentair through transformation and recovery of the inefficiencies that we realized. Please turn to Slide 6, labeled Pentair at a Glance. For those of you listening today who may be new to our story, I wanted to reiterate a few important key metrics that I discussed last quarter.In 2022, we generated $4.1 billion in sales with approximately a 50% mix from residential channels and 50% from commercial, industrial and infrastructure channels. We have decent profitability at 18.6%, but as I mentioned previously, we have a lot of opportunity to improve this. We believe our large installed base is an advantage and an opportunity for us. For example, 75% of our products are replacement inside a large installed base that benefits from over 75,000 focused trade partners. We believe these relationships with our trade channel partners drive resiliency of revenue and create a great opportunity for continued growth as we introduce new products and technologies. We have a long successful track record of generating cash flow and being disciplined with our capital allocation.In fact, we have increased our dividend for the 47th consecutive year, putting us in a very small group inside of the S&amp;P 500, and we are especially proud of our high-teens ROIC, demonstrating that we continue to be good stewards with your invested money. We believe we have a very solid foundation and we know there's still more we can do. Please turn to Slide 7, labeled Our Impact: Making Better Essential for People and the Planet. Our work on ESG and social responsibility continues to be at the forefront of how we operate and how we work to make the planet better. At Pentair, we take great pride in the products we develop that are providing solutions to some of the world's largest challenges, including safe and healthy drinking water, climate change and water shortages to name just a few.We also seek to make better essential for people and the planet. For example, our products and solutions improve water efficiency, reduce and capture carbon emissions and avoid the need for single-use water bottles. Here are a few highlights. 71% of Pentair solutions support water efficiency; 15.9 million tons of CO2 emissions have been avoided by U.S. consumers using Pentair's energy efficient pool pump since 2005; and nearly 8 billion single-use plastic water bottles have been avoided in 2022 due to Pentair's water filtration products. Furthermore, our leadership and social responsibility is being recognized by third-party organizations, including Forbes and others. We look forward to continued progress and plan to share additional details in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, which we expect to publish this spring.Please turn to Slide 8, labeled Strategic Framework. Our purpose, mission, vision, values and impact are critical components of our strategic framework. Our purpose matters and is to create a better world for people in the planet through smart sustainable water solutions. Our mission as a company is to help the world sustainably move, improve and enjoy water, life's most essential resource. And we do this in residential, commercial, agriculture and industrial applications. As of January 1st of this year, we have split our Consumer Solutions segment into Pool and Water Solutions. This creates three focus segments as IFT remains unchanged. We expect this to not only improve transparency, but further improve customer service, differentiate our products, measure our success externally and drive greater profitability for our shareholders.Our three segments are now Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies, Water Solutions and Pool. We continue to see great opportunity in all three of these segments and the businesses that each of them lead. Our Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies segment helps move water where you need it, when you need it more efficiently in our pump businesses. The segment also focuses on transforming waste into value through our sustainable gas and membrane businesses. Our Water Solutions segment, which includes our most recent acquisition, Manitowoc Ice, is a leading platform to provide water and ice to our food service and residential customers. These businesses improve water by providing great tasting, higher-quality water and ice while helping our customers use more -- water more productively.Our Pool business helps enjoy water by using less energy and chemicals. In North America, it also has a large installed base of approximately 5.4 million pools with an average age of 20 to 25 years. The industry is approximately 60% break and fix, 20% major remodeling, and 20% new pools. Only about 50% of all in-ground pools have some form of automation, which we believe is a long-term opportunity for Pentair. I will now pass the call over to Bob, who will discuss our performance and financial results in more detail. Bob?Bob Fishman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, labeled Q4 2022 Pentair Performance. I will also be discussing our full year performance on Slide 10. We delivered fourth quarter sales growth of 1% with core sales declining 3% as strong price contribution was not enough to offset volume decline. Consumer Solutions core sales were down 11%, as expected and previously communicated, due to residential channel inventory levels rebalancing and as a result of our lead times beginning to return to more normal levels. Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies reported strong 11% core sales growth with strength in commercial flow and industrial solutions. For the full year, sales grew 9% with core sales up 6%. Consumer Solutions delivered 4% core sales growth, and Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies saw core sales growth of 10%.Fourth quarter segment income increased 10%, and return on sales expanded 130 basis points year-over-year to 18.2%, driven primarily by price, significantly offsetting inflation. Productivity was negatively impacted by lower volume in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.82 was down 6% versus the prior year, but exceeded our guidance for the quarter. Net interest and other expense was $28.2 million, which represented our first full quarter of new financing post the Manitowoc acquisition. And our adjusted tax rate was 12.7% during the quarter, with a share count of 165.2 million. For the full year, segment income grew 12% and return on sales expanded 40 basis points to 18.6%. Adjusted EPS increased 8% for the year to $3.68. Our tax rate ended the year at 14.5%, and our share count was 165.6 million.Please turn to Slide 11, labeled Q4 2022 Consumer Solutions Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Consumer Solutions, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, Consumer Solutions sales declined 1% with core sales declining 11%, comprised of 15 points of price, offset by 26 points of volume decline. This was in line with our expectations. The volume decline was due to difficult year-over-year comparisons and the anticipated inventory correction across many product lines in our residential channels. Segment income grew 7%, and return on sales expanded 150 basis points to 23.1%, as strong pricing measures continued to play out along with the contribution from Manitowoc Ice.For the year, Consumer Solutions sales grew 12% with core sales up 4%. Segment income grew 10%, and return on sales declined 40 basis points to 23.3%. Our pool business had sales growth of 4% for the year. Water treatment saw sales growth of 28%, led by contribution from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition, which was completed at the end of July. Please turn to Slide 13, labeled Q4 2022 Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies Performance. In addition to the fourth quarter performance for Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies, I will also be referencing the full year performance on Slide 14. Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies grew sales 5% in the quarter, partially offset by a 4% FX headwind with core sales increasing 11%. Segment income grew 21%, and return on sales expanded an impressive 240 basis points to 17.4%, marking the second consecutive quarter of greater than 200 basis points of improvement.Nature, Water, TreatmentPhoto by Ivan Bandura on UnsplashThe strong margin expansion was a result of significant price contribution and moderating inflation. For the year, sales increased 6% with core sales increasing 10%. Segment income grew 14%, and return on sales increased 110 basis points to 16.1%, as strong price more than offset inflation and FX headwinds. IFT saw sales growth across the segment with residential flow up 3%, commercial flow up 6% and industrial solutions up 10%. Please turn to Slide 15, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. As a reminder, this slide reflects the closing of the Manitowoc acquisition at the end of July. We ended the quarter with pro forma a leverage of 2.5 times, and our return on invested capital was at 15.7%, declining slightly due to the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice.I would like to remind you that given the rising interest rate environment, we are comfortable being two-thirds variable as we were less inclined to lock into higher rates for longer. We have no significant long-term debt maturing for the next few years and the majority of our debt is in term loans going out three to five years. We generated $283 million of free cash flow from continuing operations in the year, which was in line with our messaging on the Q3 earnings call. Working capital was a significant headwind this year, primarily inventories, which has led to a timing issue on cash flow. Our inventories were higher largely due to inflation, (ph) and inefficiencies in the supply chain. We expect to benefit from working capital improvement in 2023 and generate free cash flow in line with our historical performance of 100% of net income.In 2022, we returned roughly two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We plan to remain disciplined with our capital, and we'll continue to focus on debt reduction amid the higher interest rate environment. Please turn to Slide 16, labeled Segment Structure Beginning in 2023. As John discussed, we moved to three reporting segments effective January 01, 2023. We have included realigned historical information for these segments from 2019 to 2022 in the supplemental data section of our earnings presentation. Our Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies segment had roughly $1.5 billion of revenue in 2022 with a ROS of approximately 16%. This business grows sales at roughly single digits over the long term in a very large industry.Water Solutions consists of residential and commercial and was roughly $1.2 billion of revenue on a pro forma basis when including a full year of Manitowoc Ice. This is a mid-single digit sales growth contributor over the long term, operating in a very large industry. Finally, Pool was roughly $1.6 billion of revenue in 2022 and is our highest profitability segment that we expect will grow sales mid-single digit plus over the long term. Please turn to Slide 17, labeled Transformation Expectations. We have moved transformation from funnel to execution, and we expect more material benefits to contribute to our longer-term margin expansion targets. In 2022, we made strategic progress on our transformation initiatives with a primary focus on two of our four key themes: pricing excellence and strategic sourcing.Overall, we believe transformation will be a key driver in value creation over the next three years. For example, through our transformation initiative, we have identified over 400 basis points of targeted margin expansion by 2025, up from the 300 basis points that we discussed at our previous Investor Day. A significant portion of that is due to a focus on material costs, which represent roughly 40% of our sales. By driving transformation excellence through pricing and sourcing, we believe this will have the most significant impact on overall cost efficiencies. With the work we have completed in 2022, we believe that we can expand return on sales to approximately 23% in 2025. In pricing, we have completed wave one, which has established a new strategic pricing playbook.This creates a foundation for pricing across our different go-to-market strategies and includes looking at our dealer and distributor programs to better optimize them. We are gaining insight into profitability by customer and product category and using this data to better drive our forecast. We believe pricing remains a big opportunity. We are building capabilities and starting to see benefits materialize. We expect future waves to include the implementation of our pricing playbook across all categories. We are furthest along in our strategic sourcing initiatives. We have completed wave one that focused on key categories, like electronics, motors and drives, castings, packaging, logistics and MRO. Wave one included roughly 35% of material spend and has generated over 12% in savings opportunities.We expect to unlock value through supplier-dedicated resources, supply base reduction, inventory solutions, enhanced supplier executive level relationships and rebate programs. We expect to reduce complexity across our entire organization and to see close to 80% supplier reduction in some of our commodity groups. Over 75 Pentair team members attended 3,000 plus hours of formal classroom instruction and workshops in supply chain topics. As we institutionalize our wave one learnings, we expect this will drive future waves as we look at additional categories. Wave two is scheduled to start in 2023 and is planned to cover another 35% of material spend for commodity groups such as metals, plastics and molding, purchase finished goods, transportation, and indirect spend such as IT, fleet management and office supplies.We expect this will create a funnel of savings for 2023 and 2024. In operations excellence, we are focused on reducing complexity and driving lean processes across all our operations. In 2022, we made a few small strides on footprint optimization. We believe this presents longer-term opportunities, but not until 2024 and beyond, as we build out the funnel. Lastly, in organizational effectiveness, we are focusing on sales and functional excellence to simplify our organization. From an organizational standpoint, we believe ample opportunities remain for complexity reduction across the entire portfolio and a realignment of needed skills within our top priorities. We continue to believe that our transformation initiatives will be a large value creation opportunity for Pentair.Please turn to Slide 18, labeled Q1 and Full Year 2023 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are introducing adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $3.50 to $3.70, which represents a year-over-year range of down 5% to up 1%. We expect sales to be roughly down 3% to up 1%. We expect segment income to increase 5% to 10%, with corporate expense of approximately $80 million, net interest expense of roughly $125 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% and a share count of 165 million to 166 million. We are targeting free cash flow of approximately 100% of net income as we expect working capital to improve and inventory levels to come down. For the first quarter, we are introducing adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $0.76 to $0.78, which represents a year-over-year decrease of approximately 8% to 11%.We expect sales to be roughly flat to up 1%, as the contribution of Manitowoc Ice helps offset expected volume declines from the rebalancing of residential channel inventory. We expect segment income to increase 5% to 8%, with corporate expense coming in around $21 million, net interest expense of roughly $33 million, an adjusted tax rate of approximately 15% and a share count of 165 million to 166 million. Please turn to Slide 19, labeled Full Year 2023 Guidance at Midpoint. The chart on Slide 19 shows a walk of sales and segment income at the midpoint of our full year 2023 guidance. From the sales walk on the left-hand side, you will see that we expect sales to be down roughly 1% at the midpoint. We expect volume to be down approximately 10%, primarily due to our residential businesses.We expect price benefit of approximately 5% and a benefit from acquisitions/divestitures of roughly 5%, primarily due to a full year of Manitowoc Ice, partially offset by exits in the residential businesses and water solutions. We expect Pool sales to be down low double digits at the midpoint in 2023 after growing 14% in 2020, 40% in 2021 and 4% in 2022. We believe 2023 will be an inventory rebalancing year across the pool industry. We do think that there was a higher-than-normal level of demand in 2020 and 2021 that led to timing and supply chain disruptions in the industry and, therefore, created larger-than-normal impact between sell-through and sell-in reflected in our results. We estimate that from a sell-through perspective, the overall industry grew about 4% on a volume basis from 2019 to 2022, roughly in line with historical levels.As we have discussed, our Pool sales consists of 20% from new pools 20% from remodels and 60% from the aftermarket. At the midpoint, we expect that new pools and remodels will be down approximately 20% in 2023 and the aftermarket business, including inventory corrections in Q1 through Q3, will be down approximately 15%. We expect price carryover for Pool will be up roughly mid-single digit. We do expect the industry and our Pool revenue to return to more normalized growth later in 2023 and in 2024, reflecting a more even balance of sell-through and distribution buying patterns. As a reminder, even with an expected (ph) year of down double digits in 2023, we expect to grow at a double digit CAGR in Pool from 2019 through 2023. We expect our Water Solutions segment sales to be up mid-teens at the midpoint, including up approximately 40% in our commercial business with a full year of Manitowoc Ice and down approximately 10% in our residential business.We expect IFT sales to be up slightly at the midpoint with the commercial, industrial and infrastructure businesses up approximately mid-single digits and residential down approximately double digits. On the segment income side, we expect segment income to grow approximately 8% at the midpoint and to expand ROS roughly 150 basis points. We expect price to slightly exceed inflation. We expect approximately 35% ROS from our acquisitions and divestitures. Our transformation initiatives and productivity should deliver over 200 basis points of margin expansion. And we expect drop through of roughly 30% on the decrease in volume. We expect our greater than 200 basis points of transformation and productivity benefit will be the result of volume rightsizing actions that we undertook in the fourth quarter of 2022, inefficiencies in our 2022 results that will not repeat in 2023 and our transformation initiatives.Our comments are based on the midpoint of the range. The lower end of our range would be reflective of higher interest rates, impacting housing demand and residential sales and increasing our interest expense. As we think about the higher end of our range, our main drivers would be a better outcome in the residential businesses, primarily Pool, and overdriving some of the transformation benefits. In closing, we expect the lower Pool year in 2023 to be offset by the strength of our diversified portfolio and our transformation initiatives. We are confident in the expected benefits from our transformation initiatives and we believe we are gaining continued momentum, to not only drive savings in 2023, but to build a strong funnel for 2024 and 2025, with significant ROS expansion.We also expect ROS expansion as our residential businesses return to more normalized growth in 2024 and beyond. I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A, after which John will have a few closing remarks. Kate, please open the line for questions.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Kellogg (K) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.87 a share, just seven days from its upcoming earnings release on February 9, 2023.K has an Earnings ESP figure of 4.12%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.87 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.84.K is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Mondelez (MDLZ).Mondelez is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 25, 2023. MDLZ's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.82 a share 82 days from its next earnings release.Mondelez's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.19% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.81.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, K and MDLZ could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

High IRP may contribute to a range of post-operative complications including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis and renal damage.3,4 The built-in pressure sensor on the LithoVue Elite ureteroscope tip is designed to allow urologists to make informed, pressure-related clinical decisions.Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9029351-boston-scientific-fda-clearance-lithovue-elite-system/""Multiple studies have shown the importance of understanding intrarenal pressure during ureteroscopy procedures to mitigate potential complications, but until now, urologists have lacked an easy way to measure pressure in real-time,"" said Ben Chew, M.D., M.Sc., associate professor, University of British Columbia.5 ""This device represents an important and needed advancement in single-use ureteroscopes, which could help improve patient care and potentially lead to a clearer understanding of the impact of elevated intrarenal pressure on patient outcomes.""The LithoVue Elite System, comprised of the single-use digital flexible ureteroscope and the StoneSmart™ Connect Console, builds on many of the features of the original LithoVue™ System with significant next-generation innovations. In addition to intrarenal pressure monitoring, device enhancements include:Story continuesupgraded image quality: high-resolution digital chip and advanced imaging software designed to provide faster, sharper image quality and greater depth of field compared to the original LithoVue System;updated control features: two programmable buttons on the lightweight, single-use ureteroscope handle enable direct control of video and image capture without the need to coordinate with staff; andstreamlined integration: the StoneSmart Connect Console, LithoVue Elite's compact processing unit, is designed to work with existing operating room visualization towers and endoscopic monitors to reduce clutter and capital footprint.""We're at a critical moment in kidney stone care where patient demand is outpacing the number of urologists needed to address it,"" said Meghan Scanlon, senior vice president and president, Urology and Pelvic Health, Boston Scientific. ""We designed the next-generation LithoVue Elite System to bring a greater level of precision and functionality in the way urologists diagnose and treat kidney stones, an increasingly common condition among adults.6 We are committed to developing clinical solutions, like the LithoVue Elite System, that are intended to make procedures more efficient, empower surgical decisions, optimize patient care and ultimately improve the treatment of kidney stone disease globally.""The LithoVue Elite System is the latest device in the Boston Scientific single-use imaging portfolio, developed with physician feedback to advance patient care and eliminate infection risk associated with ineffective reprocessing of reusable scopes.

At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.Mike Mahoney : Thanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2022 represented a return to more durable and consistent procedural growth within the markets we serve, which provided a stronger base for our innovative portfolio. I'm very proud of the resiliency and winning spirit of our global team, delivering on our sales and EPS goals despite the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain challenges. Importantly, we delivered strong performance across all geographic regions and believe that most all of our business units gained or maintained market share throughout the year. In fourth quarter '22, total company operational sales grew 9% and organic sales grew 7% versus fourth quarter '21, which was the low end of the guidance range.However, it's very important to note that these results include an unplanned sales reserve of $60 million, established for an Italian government payback provision which resulted in a headwind of approximately 200 basis points for the quarter. The underlying fourth quarter performance was strong on both sales; operating margin increases and earnings per share. And without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our organic sales guidance range of 7% to 9%. Full year '22 operational sales grew 11% versus '21, while organic sales grew 9%, in line with our guidance of approximately 9%. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.45 declined minus 2% versus '21, and full year adjusted EPS of $1.71 grew 5% versus '21, both achieved in the low end of the guidance range.Once again, without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would achieve the high end of the guidance range for both fourth quarter and full year of $1.71 to $1.74. We generated full year free cash flow of $950 million and adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion, in line with our expectations. Now for outlook for 2023. We are guiding to organic growth of 6% to 8% for both first quarter '23 and full year '23, which excludes the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and all of which are expected to close in the first half of 2023. Our first quarter '23 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.42 to $0.44, and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $1.86 to $1.93. And despite the ongoing macroeconomic pressures and supply chain headwinds, we remain committed to our goal of plus 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2023.Dan will provide more details on our '22 performance, the Italian sales reserve and our '23 outlook. I'll now provide some additional highlights on '22 results along with comments on our '23 outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 10% versus fourth quarter '21. Full year '22 grew 11%, inclusive of a 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions, with particular strength in our WATCHMAN, Endo and urology business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% on a full year basis. This above-market growth was supported by ongoing investments in emerging markets, new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, pricing discipline and strong commercial execution. We're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our innovative EP portfolio and further opportunity with Baylis in the Access Solutions franchise.Asia Pacific grew 10% operationally versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% for the full year. On a full year basis, six out of eight business units grew double digits, supported by ongoing innovation across the region. Full year Japan growth was driven by new products, including POLARx, which has approximately 50% share in open accounts. We look forward to 2023 with ongoing momentum from both new products and are excited about our recent approval and reimbursement received for AGENT DCB, which is a coronary drug-coated balloon for restenosis in small vessels. On a full year basis, China grew more than 20%, fueled by 13 new product launches, ongoing portfolio diversification and the team's resiliency and execution. We continue to expand our presence in the China market with the recently announced acquisition of a majority stake in Acotec.We believe this investment can create strategic value for both companies with opportunities to collaborate in R&amp;D, manufacturing and commercial strategies. We also continue to expect China to be a double-digit grower in '23 despite ongoing VBP pressure and potential impact to procedure volumes in Q1 from COVID. In Latin America, the momentum continued with operational sales growth of 16% versus fourth quarter '21 and full year growth of 28%, with all business units growing double digits versus '21. On the business units, starting with urology. Urology sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis. They grew 15% operationally and 10% organically versus '21. Within the quarter, all franchises grew double digits, fueled by new and ongoing product launches and continued global expansion.On a full year basis, global growth was driven by key products such as LithoVue, Rezum and SpaceOAR as well as the acquisition of the Lumenis Moser laser technology, further complementing the urology portfolio. Endoscopy sales grew 7% organically in the quarter, and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21. In '22, we had global success with innovative products such as AXIOS and Single-Use imaging, both growing over 20% and supporting strong growth across the globe. In the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Apollo Endosurgery, which will add a complementary and innovative endoluminal surgery portfolio. We look forward to closing this acquisition as well as our previously announced majority stake in M.I. Tech, which includes the innovative stent in the first half of '23.Neuromodulation sales grew 5% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 3% organically versus '21. Globally, our spinal cord stimulation business grew 4% in the fourth quarter with continued physician enthusiasm for WaveWriter Alpha and FAST. We continue to invest in clinical evidence to expand indications and present three-month data from our nonsurgical back study, SOLIS, at NANS earlier this year. The study comparing SCS to conventional medical management met its primary endpoints, and we anticipate FDA approval for nonsurgical back indication by the end of '23. Our Brain franchise grew double digits in the quarter and low double digits on a full year basis. This strong performance is aided by continued momentum from new product launches in '22 as well as the recent launch of the Vercise 2-in-1 lead extension.Peripheral Intervention sales grew 9% organically versus both fourth quarter '21 and full year '21. Within Arterial, we are pleased with the performance of our drug-eluting portfolio growing strong double digits for the full year and achieving the number one global position -- I'm sorry, the number one position within SFA in the U.S. On a full year basis, our venous franchise was flat versus prior year with Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein offering, growing over 20% in 2022. Our Interventional Oncology franchise performed well in '22, growing low double digits, led by our portfolio of innovative cancer therapies and suite of embolization tools. We continue to invest in expanding the potential applications of TheraSphere and enrolled our first patient in our early feasibility study, frontier the image of -- safety of image-guided intra-arterial delivery of TheraSphere GBM in patients with the reoccurring glioblastoma.Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with operational sales growing 13% and organic sales growing 10% versus fourth quarter '21. On a full year basis, sales grew 14% operationally and 10% organically. Our newly aligned cardiology group delivered strong growth across its four businesses, as we continue to invest in the higher growth segments and differentiated offerings for our customers that address the areas of greatest cardiac need for patients. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew 5% organically in fourth quarter and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21. On a full year basis, the Coronary Therapies' franchise, which includes both drug-eluting stents and complex PCI grew 7%, driven by strong performance in our international regions and our imaging franchise.Our structural Heart Valves franchise grew double digits in both fourth quarter and the full year basis, outpacing the market in Europe with our ACURATE neo2 aortic valve. Ongoing clinical evidence to support growth throughout '22 and in the fourth quarter. Data from the ACURATE neo2 PMCF study was presented as a late breaker at PCR London Valves, demonstrating positive safety and 30-day outcomes with low PVL rates and best-in-class pacemaker implantation rates. Additionally, we enrolled our first patient in the ACURATE Prime XL Nested Registry, assessing the safety and efficacy of the ACURATE Prime Aortic Valve XL to treat patients with severe aortic restenosis who need a larger valve size for the TAVR procedure. WATCHMAN sales grew 22% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 24% organically versus '21.Q4 finished with record sales, strong utilization in the U.S. supported by the DAPT label expansion. Importantly, we completed the enrollment of our CHAMPION-AF trial way ahead of schedule. This head-to-head trial versus novel oral anticoagulation has the potential to more than triple the number of patients indicated for WATCHMAN FLEX in 2027 and beyond. We remain excited about this outlook for this business and expect double-digit growth in 2023, fueled by innovation, ongoing clinical evidence and strong commercial execution. CRM sales grew 6%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 8% operationally and 7% organically. Our Diagnostics franchise had a strong year, growing double digits versus '21.In core CRM, on the full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low single digits, and our low voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we expect that all major markets were in line or slightly above the market. Electrophysiology sales grew 76% operationally and 25% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 69% operationally and 18% organically versus '21. Importantly, our international EP business continues to outpace the market, growing over 40% organically versus fourth quarter '21. POLARx continues to perform well in both Europe and Japan has now been treated to treat over patients since launch. Momentum in FARAPULSE continues with another strong quarter of growth in Europe. And we continue to invest in clinical evidence and look forward to the readout of the randomized ADVENT U.S. IDE trial in the second half of '23 and are planning to initiate our ADVANTAGE AF trial these therapods patients with persistent AFib imminently.We've been very pleased with the performance of our Baylis acquisition and the innovative platform, which grew 2 times faster than the market in '22. We launched our VersaCross Connect in '22, improving efficiencies in our WATCHMAN procedure. Earlier this year, we shared our strategy consistent with years past. We continue to position ourselves to win in the markets we play through meaningful innovation by balancing our financial commitments. And in '22, we announced four acquisitions, invested 10% of our sales in internal R&amp;D to fund sustainable growth and advance patient care. We're extremely excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our people and sustaining a culture that is motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-term goals, continuing to grow sales faster than markets, continuing to expand operating margins and delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow generation.So, before I turn it over to Dan, I want to share that with the retirement of Dr. Ian Meredith, Dr. Ken Stein will assume some of the global responsibilities that previously fell under Ian, including total company investor engagement, in addition to a CRM, EP and WATCHMAN roles. Please join me in congratulating Ken, and thank Ian for his many contributions. With that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials.Dan Brennan : Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $3.242 billion represents a 3.7% reported revenue growth versus the fourth quarter 2021 and reflects a $158 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly favorable to our expectations as the U.S. dollar weakened throughout the quarter. Excluding this 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 8.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisition of Baylis contributed 160 basis points resulting in 7.1% organic revenue growth at the low end of our guidance range of 7% to 9% growth versus 2021, including an approximate 200 basis point impact associated with an unplanned sales reserve related to an Italian government payback provision, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.With the goal of recovering spending above the government's medical device budgets, this payback provision requires companies that have supplied medical devices to public hospitals in Italy to pay back a portion of these overrun amounts. While we and others in our industry, have appealed and will continue to challenge the enforceability of the law through the Italian court system. We established a sales reserve of $60 million in the fourth quarter, representing our best estimates of amounts we could be required to pay back. Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of the organic revenue growth guidance range. Flow-through on the Italian sales reserve resulted in Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.45, at the low end of our range, representing a decline of 2% versus 2021.Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our range for the quarter. Full year 2022 consolidated revenue of $12.682 billion represents 6.7% reported revenue growth versus full year 2021 and reflects a $524 million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding this 440 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 11.1% for the year. Sales from closed acquisitions contributed 240 basis points, resulting in 8.7% organic revenue growth, in line with expectations and inclusive of a 50 basis point impact associated with the Italian sales reserve. Full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 represents 4.8% growth versus 2021, achieving the low end of our guidance range of $1.71 to $1.74. Without the unplanned Italian sales reserve, we would have been at the high end of our full year guidance range.Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.5%, resulting in full year 2022 adjusted gross margin also of 70.5%, in line with our expectations. Full year adjusted gross margin improved versus 2021, driven by an FX tailwind of approximately 100 basis points related to our hedging contracts, partially offset by continued macroeconomic headwinds. These headwinds were approximately $375 million versus 2019 and are predominantly from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances primarily related to direct material cost and availability. Our 2023 guidance assumes macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds will be similar to 2022. Different from prior years, we expect first half 2023 gross margin to be higher than the second half, largely due to the timing of foreign exchange movements that occurred during 2022.Doctor Specialties with Best LifestyleBillion Photos/Shutterstock.comFourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.7% resulting in full year 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6%, improving 30 basis points versus 2021, inclusive of a 30 basis point negative impact from the unplanned Italian sales reserve. As we look to 2023, we continue to focus on our goal of annual operating margin expansion. And despite our expectation of continued macroeconomic headwinds, our goal is to achieve approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin for the full year 2023, representing 80 basis points of improvement versus the 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6% and importantly, 50 basis points of expansion compared to the full year 2022 adjusted operating margin without the impact of the Italian sales reserve. On a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 12.4%, including $131 million in litigation-related expenses, which I'll provide detail on in a moment.Moving to below the line. Fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expense totaled $88 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expense of $362 million, slightly higher than our expectations, driven in part by an FX loss from certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 11.9% and 12.7% for the full year 2022 and including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 12% for the fourth quarter and 13.5% for the full year, slightly favorable to our expectations of approximately 14%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.442 billion in Q4 and 1.440 billion for the full year 2022. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $776 million, and free cash flow was $597 million with $807 million from operating activities less $210 million of net capital expenditures.Full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion, in line with expectations, and free cash flow was $949 million with $1.5 billion from operating activities less $576 million of net capital expenditures. For 2023, we expect adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of $928 million. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and Acotec with cash on hand or available credit lines in the first half of 2023. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high-quality tuck-in M&amp;A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. As of December 31, our leverage was 2.57 times, in line with our expectations, and we were pleased to be upgraded to BBB+ with a stable outlook at both Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor's within the quarter.Our legal reserve was $443 million as of December 31, an increase of $139 million from the prior quarter, primarily related to our mesh litigation. While our U.S. case count has remained materially the same over the past three years, we've increased our reserve to account for our latest estimates of the time and cost to resolve these claims as well as remaining probable and estimable global claims. I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2023. And as a reminder, guidance excludes any acquisitions that have not yet closed. We expect full year 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 7% versus 2022. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, and a 20 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8% versus 2022.We expect first quarter 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 3% to 5% versus Q1 2022. Excluding an approximate 350 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and a 70 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8%. We expect our full year 2023 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $340 million. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we forecast a full year 2023 operational tax rate of approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% including the benefit of the accounting for stock compensation, which we expect will largely be recognized in the first quarter, resulting in a Q1 2023 adjusted tax rate of approximately 12%.We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.447 billion shares for Q1 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023, which includes the shares we expect to issue on June 1 this year related to our May 2020 mandatory convertible preferred stock offering. We expect the impact to adjusted earnings per share to be neutral with the preferred stock dividend ending at the time of conversion. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.93, representing 9% to 13% growth versus 2022. At current rates and existing hedging contracts, we anticipate a neutral impact from FX on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.42 to $0.44.For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q4 results and 2023 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of the results that our global team achieved in 2022 with top-tier revenue performance and differentiated operating margin expansion despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, and I'm looking forward to continued momentum during 2023. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&amp;A.Lauren Tengler: Thanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so.

(ULTA) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-hit-141502462.html,1675347302,STORY,"['ULTA', 'ARHS']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $525.89 in the previous session. Ulta Beauty has gained 11.6% since the start of the year compared to the 13.4% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 10.9% return for the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on December 1, 2022, Ulta reported EPS of $5.34 versus consensus estimate of $4.09.For the current fiscal year, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $24.19 per share on $9.98 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $26.33 per share on $10.77 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 5.74% and 7.84%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUlta may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Ulta has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 16.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 22.6X versus its peer group's average of 7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.57. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Ulta currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Ulta fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Ulta shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does ULTA Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ULTA have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Arhaus, Inc. (ARHS). ARHS has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. Arhaus, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 80%, and for the current fiscal year, ARHS is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share on revenue of $1.23 billion.Shares of Arhaus, Inc. have gained 43.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 16.47X and a P/CF of 19.23X.The Retail - Miscellaneous industry may rank in the bottom 69% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ULTA and ARHS, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend investing, and go directly to read 5 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right Now. On February 1, 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, which marked its eighth increase since March 2022. The continuous interest rate hikes have made investors anxious about the stock market’s future. According to Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in January, investors broadly gave a pessimistic view of the market. However, over half of the respondents showed an inclination toward cheaper value stocks, considering their outperformance over growth equities in 2022. In addition to this, companies that have proven track records of dividend growth also made it to investors’ choice.Value stocks showed their greatest performance last year against growth equities since 2000, as reported by Bloomberg. Analysts expect the trend of value investing to continue this year as higher interest rates put margin pressures on the technology sector. Moreover, last year’s selloff was the worst for tech stocks since 2008, so investors are moving toward defensive quality stocks to stay afloat during this period. In this regard, dividend stocks regained their appeal, with dividend payments reaching their record high in 2022. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, compared with $511.2 billion in 2021. The report also mentioned that 373 companies in the S&amp;P 500 raised their dividend through December 15, up from 353 in 2021. These results show that companies have the sufficient cash flow to fulfill their shareholder obligation smoothly.AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) are some of the popular dividend companies that are gaining popularity among investors. These companies not only have raised their dividends for years but also have strong cash generation that promises further growth in the future. Given this, we will discuss the cheapest dividend aristocrats in this article.Story continues15 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right NowPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below belong to the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats, the companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more.

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE:CAH)Forward P/E Ratio as of February 2: 14.47Cardinal Health, Inc.

428,d4966886-98cd-385c-90be-87bd871794bd,MHK,2023-02-03,Analysts Estimate Mohawk Industries (MHK) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-mohawk-industries-mhk-150103713.html,1675350063,STORY,['MHK'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Mohawk Industries (MHK) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis flooring maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -56.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.73 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mohawk Industries?For Mohawk Industries, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mohawk Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mohawk Industries would post earnings of $3.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.34, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Mohawk Industries doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now, I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.Jim Fish: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. 2022 was another very successful year at WM. Coming into an uncertain 2022, I wouldn't have predicted that we would grow adjusted operating EBITDA by more than 9.5% for the year, and 8.8% for the fourth quarter, all while recycling was down $59 million for the year on a sharp drop in commodity prices. That's exactly what happened. Strong operational execution and an unwavering commitment to our strategic priorities led to our full year adjusted operating EBITDA growth of $480 million. We achieved this tremendous growth in the face of elevated inflation, a tight labor market, and a downturn in the recycled commodity price market. So, we're very proud of our results. Our robust operating EBITDA translated into record cash from operations of more than $4.5 billion, which allowed us to return more than $2.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.As 2023 kicks off, we're confident that our long-term focus is on sustainable growth, transforming our business through technology and automation are setting us up to meet the changing needs of our customers, our people, and our business environment, while leveraging our competitive advantages. Turning to our high-level outlook for 2023. We expect to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA of between $5.825 billion and $5.975 billion in the year ahead, representing growth of just over 7% at the midpoint, which continues the trend of robust operating EBITDA growth that we've delivered since 2019. Since then, we've grown operating EBITDA almost 26%. And at a time when the economic outlook is increasingly uncertain, we're pleased to be anticipating another strong year of earnings growth in 2023.The essential nature of our service, our diverse customer base, and recurring revenue streams provide stability in times of economic uncertainty. Much of the growth in our 2023 outlook comes from deliberate steps that we've already taken to grow revenue and efficiently manage costs. Overall, we're anticipating between 40 and 80 basis points of adjusted operating EBITDA margin expansion in the year ahead, driven by our collection and disposal business. Moving now to our sustainability growth investment. Let me give you an abbreviated overview of the supplemental deck that was posted to our Investors website. The investment in our renewable energy business is a unique opportunity that we simply couldn't afford to mass. You're all aware that since the passage of the subtitle B and associated air quality regulations in the 1980s and 1990s, landfill has been required to install gas collection systems.Historically, we've been collecting our landfill gas, converting much of it into electricity, which provides an earnings stream for us. Fast forward to present day, with landfill gas designated as a renewable resource, we are increasing the value of the gas that's an inevitable byproduct of most landfills. These RNG plants are simply taking gas that's naturally produced from the landfill and converting it into a cash-generating machine with a three-year projected payback and a far better environmental outcome than the status quo. And our returns far surpass those of our competition by virtue of our CNG fleet, which today represents 74% of our routed vehicles. As a result, we're better positioned to close the loop and capture extremely valuable regulatory RIN credits.At the same time, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will provide tax credits and benefits that served to amplify the value creation of WM's renewable energy business. The supplemental presentation to the earnings press release provides details on the investments and our projections for cash flow and operating EBITDA growth. But suffice it to say, we view this as a very strong positive for shareholders. We have a number of attractive options for our renewable energy portfolio. Internally, we said there are three possible outcomes from this opportunity, good, really good or great. And we're heading down the great path by owning the landfill gas and renewable energy facilities, generating RINs through our CNG fleet and maximizing the value of new tax benefits to increase the resulting earnings and cash flows.We're also advancing our planned recycling investments and have provided more details in the supplemental presentation on our website. Our portfolio of projects to automate existing and build new material recovery facilities have three key financial benefits; reduced labor costs, improved product quality that commands a price premium and capacity growth. In the fourth quarter, labor costs per ton at our single-stream automated MRFs improved by 35%. The automation of these plants enabled us to reduce 137 positions through attrition in 2022. And in 2023, we expect to reduce labor dependence by another 200 positions. By the end of 2023, we're anticipating about a 15% increase in processing capacity from our automated facilities and new markets.We will host a virtual information session for investors on April 5th to provide even more insight into our recycling and renewable energy growth plans. Devina will discuss our 2023 capital allocation plans in more detail, but I want to emphasize our confidence in our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities, including investing in these high-return sustainability growth projects, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and acquiring accretive businesses. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another fantastic year. We look forward to 2023 as we continue to execute on our operating plans and progress our investments in renewable energy, recycling and automation to drive growth.I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results.John Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Jim described our fantastic results in 2022 and that all begins with our collection and disposal business. In the face of some of the highest inflationary cost pressures, our collection and disposal business delivered double-digit in adjusted EBITDA for the full year. During the fourth quarter, collection and disposal results were even more impressive as adjusted operating EBITDA grew more than 11% and margin expanded 40 basis points. This momentum sets the stage for continued growth in 2023 and strengthens our conviction that the investments we're making in our people in automation and in differentiating our service offerings are the right decisions. The growth in our collection and disposal business starts at the top of the income statement with robust organic revenue growth.Full year core price was 7.8% with collection and disposal yield of 6.7% and volume of 1.8%. As we work to keep pace with decades high inflation, our revenue management teams delivered record core price in 2022 in every one of our lines of business, led by 10.5% in our commercial line of business. We talk often about our focus on generating appropriate returns in our residential and post-collection lines of business. And in 2022, we delivered core price of 6.5% in the residential line of business, 6.4% at our landfills and 5.9% at our transfer stations. Our revenue metrics demonstrate that our customers' receptivity to our pricing remained favorable through the fourth quarter. Our rollback percentage was almost 400 basis points better for the full year, while new business pricing increased more than 6% in our commercial line of business.The results clearly demonstrate our ability to manage cost pressures through continued pricing discipline and momentum, while maintaining our focus on customer lifetime value. As we move into 2023, our disciplined pricing programs combined with the strong momentum from 2022 and are expected to deliver core price of between 6.5% and 7% with yield approaching 5.5%. Our expectation is for strong rollover of 2022 price performance. Given the acute inflationary environment in 2022, we increased certain fees that we don't expect to step up again at the same level. We remain committed to securing pricing that outpaces our cost inflation, which is demonstrated by the operating EBITDA margin expansion that we're anticipating in 2023. Shifting to volumes.In the fourth quarter, event-driven volumes remained strong with special waste and C&amp;D volumes growing double digits. Our commercial and industrial volumes were positive for the full year. However, we saw some softening in the fourth quarter. Given these recent trends, we are tempering our volume expectations in the year ahead. Our guidance includes 2023 collection and disposal volumes that are relatively flat with 2022. We continue to see the rate of labor increases easing in our business, and we remain focused on managing our operating expenses and flexing down costs, flexing costs down with the changing volumes. In our collection and disposal business, we are seeing improvements in our labor costs as inflationary wage pressures are easing.Turnover trends are improving and the investments that we are making in automation are showing benefits. These improvements were on display in the fourth quarter  in our fourth quarter results as we saw operating expense margin improved by 30 basis points despite still stubbornly higher maintenance and repair costs. For the full year of 2022, operating expenses increased 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue, but that was largely driven by negative impacts from higher fuel costs and recycling commodity prices that together impacted the measure by 80 basis points. This increase was partially offset by lower labor and related benefits costs in our collection and disposal business and improved risk management costs. Putting it all together, when you combine our pricing efforts with our progress on cost containment, we expect 2023 operating expense as a percentage of revenue to improve between 30 and 50 basis points for the full year, with those improvements beginning in the second quarter of 2023.In the fourth quarter, our recycling operating EBITDA remained solidly positive even with the sharp decline in commodity prices to about $47 per ton. Over the last several years, we have intentionally taken steps to shift the business to a fee-for-service model that has reduced our sensitivity to commodity market changes. When we started this journey in 2017, commodity prices were 60% higher than what we are anticipating in our 2023 outlook, yet 2023 operating EBITDA is expected to be about 13% higher than in 2017. This clearly demonstrates that our business model is profitable and generate solid returns in any economic environment. As we look to the future of recycling, we remain focused on advancing automation across our MRF network, which we have proven can lower the cost of process material, achieve better quality while enhancing recycling profitability.15 biggest waste management companies in the worldDmitry Kalinovsky/Shutterstock.comOur employees delivered strong results in 2022, and I want to thank the entire WM team for their commitment to providing the best customer service while focusing on improving our operations. The team has done an exceptional job, and I know that this will continue in the year ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2022 financial results and 2023 financial outlook in further detail.Devina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. Once again, our solid waste business was at the center of WM's strong quarterly results, capping off a great 2022. Our team delivered strong organic revenue growth with a diligent focus on leveraging core price to offset cost inflation, while prioritizing customer service and customer lifetime value to minimize customer churn, all resulting in record high yield. When combined with strong cost control, these efforts delivered an 80 basis point expansion of operating EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved these excellent results while investing in technology and sustainability growth that will benefit WM for years to come. Full year adjusted SG&amp;A was 9.6% of revenue, a 40 basis point improvement over 2021 as we achieved back-office operational efficiencies through standardization and process improvement that enabled us to reduce more than 600 positions through attrition.You can clearly see our strong performance and the record cash flow from operations that we achieved in 2022, which grew 4.6% to $4.536 billion. The increase in cash allowed us to accelerate investments at year-end, which brought full year capital spending to the high end of our expectations. 2022 capital expenditures totaled $2.587 billion with $2.26 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $561 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Putting these pieces together, 2022 free cash flow was $1.976 billion despite an increase in cash taxes of $370 million. During 2022, we returned a record $2.58 billion to shareholders, paying $1.08 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.5 billion of our stock.In addition, we spent $377 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business. We accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability and growth investments and achieving our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75 times. Our balance sheet is well-positioned for growth through capital investments in our business or strategic acquisitions. Moving to our 2023 financial outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate organic growth approaching 5.5% from yield. Given an expectation for a little more than 1% revenue growth from acquisitions, and a decrease in revenue contributions from recycled commodity sales and fuel surcharges, we anticipate total revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5%. When combining our plan to deliver strong organic revenue growth with a focus on optimization and cost control to drive 40 to 80 basis points of operating leverage, we expect to generate adjusted operating EBITDA of $5.825 billion to $5.975 billion in 2023.We expect to allocate $1.1 billion to capital investments in recycling and renewable natural gas growth projects in the coming year and 2023 is expected to be the peak investment year for each business. While these investments are reported as a component of our capital expenditures, and therefore, reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow. We view these investments as better than an acquisition dollar as they will produce even higher return growth as a strong complement to our existing business. Our normal course capital to support our business is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion in 2023. And free cash flow is projected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, including the impact of sustainability growth investments.Our outlook anticipates an increase in cash interest and taxes of $175 million to $215 million and about an $80 million headwind from working capital due in large part to the timing and amount of incentive compensation payments. As Jim discussed, even as we step up our investment in high-return recycling and renewable energy growth projects, we remain well positioned to allocate our cash among all of our capital allocation priorities, including returning cash to our shareholders. Given the Board of Directors intended 7.7% increase in the 2023 dividend rate, we expect dividend payments to total about $1.1 billion in the year ahead. We also expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2023, as the Board recently provided authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our stock.While our guidance does not specifically include acquisition growth, we will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing the right deals at the right price. In closing, we are proud of what we achieved in 2022, and we're excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for 2023 and future years. I want to thank our hard-working team members for all of their contributions to our success. With that, Josh, let's open the line for questions.See also 25 Countries with the Lowest Corporate Tax Rates and 15 Most Undervalued Large-cap Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Fortune's annual list of World's Most Admired Companies recognizes global businesses with strong corporate reputations.""It is an honor to be recognized among the world's most reputable and respected companies,"" said Jeffrey W.

SoCalGas' residential customers will receive a credit of $50.77 in their February or March bill.The California Climate Credit is a state program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the funds raised through the program are distributed annually in April to SoCalGas customers in the form of bill credits. Due to high natural gas bills in January, the CPUC voted to accelerate this annual credit to February or March, depending on customers' individual billing cycles.""We support the CPUC's swift action to accelerate the Climate Credit for SoCalGas customers, who are in need of relief from the market forces that have led to these unusually high bills,"" said SoCalGas Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer Gillian Wright. ""We know our customers have been feeling the effects of high gas prices acutely and this action, combined with lower market prices in February, will provide some relief. Still, we urge customers to continue to conserve and take advantage of financial assistance or payment programs that can help with high bills.""After unprecedented highs due to West Coast market conditions, market prices for natural gas have dropped significantly for February when compared to prices seen in January. While prices in the western region have decreased from the prices seen in January, they remain higher than last year.The core procurement rate changes each month and reflects the price SoCalGas pays for natural gas for residential and business customers. SoCalGas does not set the price for natural gas. Instead, natural gas prices are determined by national and regional markets. SoCalGas buys natural gas in those markets on behalf of residential and small business customers, and the cost of buying that gas is billed to those customers with no markup, meaning SoCalGas does not profit from higher gas commodity prices.Story continuesWhy Have Prices Been So High?According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), a number of factors have contributed to higher natural gas commodity prices that customers are currently seeing.Widespread, below-normal temperatures on much of the West Coast, including Washington and Oregon;High natural gas demand for heating by customers in areas with below normal temperatures;Reduced natural gas supplies to the West Coast from Canada;Reduced interstate pipeline capacity to the West Coast because of pipeline maintenance activities in West Texas; andLow natural gas storage levels in the Pacific Region.According to the EIA, the U.S. set a natural gas consumption daily record on Dec. 23, 2022, further exacerbating supply and demand woes last month.Help is AvailableConservation is one way to help lower bills. SoCalGas recommends the following tips to reduce energy usage:Lowering your thermostat three to five degrees – if health permits – can save up to 10 percent on heating costs.Installing proper caulking and weather-stripping can save roughly 10 to 15 percent on heating and cooling bills.Washing clothes in cold water to save up to 10 percent on water heating costs.Considering turning down the temperature on your water heater, keeping in mind that most hot water heaters require a temperature of 120 degrees or higher.Limiting use of non-essential natural gas appliances such as spas and fireplaces.SoCalGas' free Ways to Save tool may also help customers find ways to save on natural gas bills, with a personalized savings plan that offers a household energy analysis, customized energy-efficiency recommendations, bill comparisons and energy usage comparisons. Ways to Save can be found at socalgas.com/WaysToSave. Customers can also sign up for weekly Bill Tracker Alerts to monitor natural gas consumption, take steps to reduce usage, and avoid bill surprises.Eligible customers may sign up for a Level Pay Plan (LPP), for example, which averages their annual natural gas use and costs over 12 months. There are also financial assistance programs for eligible customers who are experiencing hardships.In January, SoCalGas tripled its contribution to the Gas Assistance Fund, increasing it to $1 million. This program helps income-qualified customers pay their natural gas bills with a one-time $100 grant.Customers can visit socalgas.com/ManageHigherBills for more information on the factors that lead to higher bills and ways we can help.For more information, please visit https://www.socalgas.com/highbills.About SoCalGasHeadquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States. SoCalGas delivers affordable, reliable, and increasingly renewable gas service to 21.8 million consumers across 24,000 square miles of Central and Southern California.

Polyolefins businesses encountered headwinds from reduced demand in Europe and Asia as well as global capacity additions.  Lower consumer demand for durable goods compressed margins for several products in the Intermediates &amp; Derivatives segment.  Oxyfuels and refining margins benefited from increased global mobility and favorable markets.LyondellBasell generated $6.1 billion in cash from operating activities during 2022.  The company remains committed to a disciplined approach to capital allocation.  In 2022, approximately $1.9 billion was reinvested in the business and $3.7 billion was returned to shareholders through the quarterly dividend, a special dividend and share repurchases.In 2022, the company launched a comprehensive review of our strategy.  Initial strategic actions included the decision to exit the refining business and the sale of the Australian polypropylene business.  The Circular &amp; Low Carbon Solutions business unit was created to accelerate progress in capturing value from serving the rapidly growing customer demand for recycled and renewable solutions.  Organizational and cultural initiatives are being implemented to increase focus on agility, accountability and value generation.  In October, the company introduced a value enhancement program that is expected to generate $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025.  Progress on this program is on track.OUTLOOKIn January, demand from consumer packaging, oxyfuels and refining markets remained stable.  Moderating energy and feedstock costs are providing some offsets to tepid global demand.  Nonetheless, challenging market conditions are expected to persist through the first half of 2023.  LyondellBasell is aligning production with global demand trends and expects first quarter average utilization rates for the assets operated by the company to be 80% for each of the Olefins &amp; Polyolefins and Intermediates &amp; Derivatives segments.  Start-up activities for the new PO/TBA capacity in Houston remain on track for the end of the first quarter 2023.  The company expects typical spring and summer seasonal demand improvements and is prepared to leverage any increased economic activity in China as the year progresses.""LyondellBasell continues on its journey to build a resilient strategy that provides sustainable growth and value for the company, its shareholders and our customers.  At our Capital Markets Day on March 14th, we will share our strategy aimed at extending the company's track record of cash generation and strong returns for shareholders,"" said Vanacker.CONFERENCE CALLLyondellBasell will host a conference call February 3 at 11 a.m. EST.  Participants on the call will include Chief Executive Officer Peter Vanacker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Michael McMurray, Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins Ken Lane, Executive Vice President of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining Kim Foley, Executive Vice President of Advanced Polymer Solutions Torkel Rhenman and Head of Investor Relations David Kinney.  For event access, the toll-free dial-in number is 1-877-407-8029, international dial-in number is 201-689-8029 or click the CallMe link.  The slides and webcast that accompany the call will be available at www.LyondellBasell.com/earnings.  A replay of the call will be available from 1:00 p.m. EST February 3 until March 3.  The replay toll-free dial-in numbers are 1-877-660-6853 and 201-612-7415.

Information contained in this release is unaudited and is subject to change.  We undertake no obligation to update the information presented herein except as required by law.INFORMATION RELATED TO FINANCIAL MEASURESThis release makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, and EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.We calculate EBITDA as income from continuing operations plus interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.  EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to profit or operating profit for any period as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.  We also present EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items.  Identified items include adjustments for ""lower of cost or market"" (""LCM""), impairment and refinery exit costs.  Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") inventory valuation methodology, which means that the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs.  Fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods, within the same fiscal year as the charge, as market prices recover.  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical costs.  If it is determined that an asset or asset group's undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized to write the asset down to its estimated fair value.  In April 2022 we announced our decision to cease operation of our Houston Refinery no later than the end of 2023.  In connection with exiting the refinery business, we began to incur costs primarily consisting of accelerated lease amortization costs, personnel related costs, accretion of asset retirement obligations and depreciation of asset retirement costs.Return on invested capital is a measure commonly used by investors to evaluate the efficiency at which a company's capital is allocated to generate income during a particular period.  Return on invested capital means income from continuing operations, adjusted for interest expense, net of tax and items affecting comparability between periods divided by a two-year average of invested capital adjusted for items affecting comparability.These measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measures are calculated.  This release contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of the time hereof.  Information contained in this release is unaudited and subject to change.LyondellBasell undertakes no obligation to update the information presented herein except to the extent required by law.Additional operating and financial information may be found on our website at www.LyondellBasell.com/investorrelations.  These measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measures are calculated.Table 2 -

437,fd292434-3691-3b0f-9001-22ac26cbc5d5,VMC,2023-02-03,Vulcan Materials' (NYSE:VMC) five-year earnings growth trails the 9.5% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vulcan-materials-nyse-vmc-five-110016267.html,1675422016,STORY,['VMC'],"[If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) share price is up 50% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year hasn't been great either, with the stock up just 1.9%.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Vulcan Materials achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Vulcan Materials' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Vulcan Materials's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Vulcan Materials' TSR for the last 5 years was 57%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Vulcan Materials shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 2.8% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 9% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Vulcan Materials has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.But note: Vulcan Materials may not be the best stock to buy.

While defensive stocks are great for your retirement portfolio, you should also add some growth potential, especially if you aren’t already a retiree.Things have shifted due to market volatility and recent selloffs, and we now see tech stocks offering similar or even less value than the stocks of inelastic businesses. Meanwhile, investors have moved into many defensive stocks which still retain a premium valuation, and wouldn’t fit the theme of being undervalued retirement stocks.With that in mind, investors should look into blue-chip and growth stocks for their retirement portfolios in February 2023. The following three offer tremendous upside potential as we go forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGEGeneral Electric$80.83BRK-BBerkshire Hathaway$307.33PYPLPayPal$79.64General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) might have overshadowed all the traditional auto-related companies in the post-pandemic era, but things are starting to turn a corner as competitors accelerate their investments in electric and renewable technology.A prime example, General Electric (NYSE:GE) remained neglected by Wall Street after its 2016 selloffs. However, its 2022 fourth-quarter earnings display an innovative company with an up-and-coming segment that could revitalize the company. I’m talking about GE Aerospace. The segment grew its sales by 22% year-on-year to $26 billion, while profits increased by 66% to $4.8 billion. This led to GE Aerospace becoming the driving force of General Electric’s growth. The company also launched GE Healthcare this year.Furthermore, General Electric expects its aerospace segment’s top line to grow “mid-to-high teens” and operating cash flow to around $5.5 billion this year. Both the company’s battery and engine businesses are also taking off, and with these growth metrics, the stock is set to trade higher. Thus, this is one of the undervalued retirement stocks on my watch list right now.Story continuesBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of undervalued retirement stocks, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is a must-buy, in my view. The Oracle of Omaha is arguably the best investor you can follow when crafting a long-term retirement portfolio. Accordingly, buying some Berkshire Hathaway stock is a great foundational place to start when planning a retirement portfolio.The company invests the majority of its funds in growth stocks and blue-chip stocks. By investing in BRK-B, you’re getting significant exposure to big-name companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Moreover, despite the stock market selloffs giving Berkshire a short-term hit to its financials, the company has a $109 billion cash buffer. In times of trouble, that stash can come in handy.Overall, you’re getting significant exposure to many of the top companies in the market with adequate stability, while also increasing your portfolio’s diversification by investing in this one stock. Of course, financials aren’t the best in the short term. But as the stock market bounces back, it’s only a matter of time until Berkshire regains momentum.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquartersPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a household name that looks too undervalued at its current valuation. Like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Wall Street will also walk back its bearish view on PayPal once the company delivers strong growth. Despite short-term hiccups in the digital payments sector, there is no doubt that digital payments are growing rapidly due to the burgeoning freelance and e-commerce markets.Moreover, the digital payments market is easily growing at a double-digit clip each year. Paypal’s dominance in the fintech sector through its “Family of Brands” which includes apps such as Venmo, Zettle, Xoom, and Honey makes it among the biggest beneficiaries of this digital payments growth.Paypal’s financials are also robust. Revenue growth is accelerating, and profits have sharply turned a corner in Q3 2022. As the company’s brisk growth continues and margins improve, PayPal will be far ahead of its pre-pandemic metrics. The only sluggish metric is its stock price, down 33.4% from February 2020, at the time of writing. Thus, PYPL stock is among the top undervalued retirement stocks to buy right now.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

443,743f9a04-ca38-3de8-9a27-377cdbc3cb89,VLO,2023-02-03,20 Largest Petrochemical Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-largest-petrochemical-companies-world-060704024.html,1675404424,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F', 'BP', 'EOG', 'VLO', 'EPD']","[In this article, we will discuss the 20 Largest Petrochemical Companies in the World. You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Largest Petrochemical Companies in the World.Petrochemicals are an essential part of our daily lives because of their ability to transform oil and gas into a variety of everyday products like plastics, fertilizers, packaging, apparel, digital devices, medical equipment, detergents, and tires. They are used in many components of the contemporary energy system, including solar panels, wind turbine blades, batteries, thermal insulation for buildings, electric car components, and essential items for our daily lives. Petrochemicals are becoming ever more crucial to the global energy system, where they already play a significant role. Since the turn of the millennium, demand for plastics, the most well-known petrochemical goods, has exceeded that of all other bulk materials (such as steel, aluminum, or cement). However, the industry has been in the headlines recently as it contributes to global carbon emissions, and climate activists have been pushing for the industry to move towards more sustainable production.The global petrochemical market size is projected to be valued at $798.8 billion by 2030, increasing from $523.56 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 5.4%. The U.S. Energy Information Agency’s International Energy Outlook projects that fossil fuels will supply 60% of primary energy consumption globally in 2050. The United States is a leader in the low-cost production of petrochemicals. Petrochemicals industrial production in the country is expected to be worth $79.8 billion in 2022 and is largely concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina.Largest Petrochemical Companies tcly / shutterstock.comAccording to the Energy Information Administration, USA's operable crude refining capacity was 17.94 million b/d on January 1, 2022, down from 18.09 million b/d at the start of 2021 and a record high of 18.98 million b/d in 2020 before the pandemic took hold. The estimate for 2022 is the lowest since 14.92 million b/d in 2014. EIA also mentions that refinery capacity might be lower than this figure because of the capacity reductions announced later in 2022. S&amp;P Global suggests various reasons for these refinery closures, including storm damage, pandemic effects, high operating costs, failure to finalize sales, lower future demand predictions, or conversions to generate more renewable fuels.Story continuesMoreover, the United States has not built any new refining capacity in decades. The last major refinery in the US came into operation in 1977 in Louisiana. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth made headlines last year when he stated that the United States would never build another refinery. His reasoning was simple: the national policy has been to restrict demand for petrochemicals, making this sector unappealing to investors, given that it takes a decade to recover the initial cost of building a refinery. His views are not incorrect; governments all over the world have been helping the electric vehicle industry to reduce the demand for petrochemicals. According to IHS Markit research, US oil and liquids demand might fall by around 25% from 20.3 million barrels per day in 2019 to an anticipated 15.3 million b/d in 2050. According to IHS's low-carbon policy scenario, US oil demand for transportation might fall to 7 million b/d by 2050. Globally, Equinor ASA predicts that demand for oil for transportation will shrink 47% between 2018 and 2050 if current trends continue, thanks to advances in fuel efficiency and electric vehicles.In the near future, the petrochemical industries of the Middle East and China will be the center of attention, with the EIA estimating that they will lead refining capacity increases in 2022 and 2023. The Saudi government is also pushing for a stronger presence in the downstream petrochemical industry to reduce its reliance on crude oil. To achieve this goal, Saudi Arabia has signed several deals with China to collaborate on various projects in the downstream oil business. Although most analysts believe that demand for petrochemicals will fall in the long term as the global economy shifts to more renewable resources, both the demand and supply of petrochemicals will increase in the next few years. According to McKinsey, continued growth in crucial end markets that utilize petrochemicals, such as packaging and construction, as well as economic development in China, India, and Southeast Asia, will boost demand. Meanwhile, the consulting firm expects supply to grow at a robust rate. However, in the ethylene market category, which dominates the petrochemicals industry, McKinsey predicts capacity to rise faster than demand, lowering profit margins in this segment.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 20 largest petrochemical companies in the world, we identified the biggest petrochemicals companies in major economies and ranked these companies in ascending order in order of their market cap. For private companies, we used a revenue multiple of 1.5x, which we think is a fair valuation multiple for the private companies operating in the petrochemical Industry.20 Largest Petrochemical Companies in the World20.

446,43512472-71d7-41f9-b3c0-9ad44a3bc0bd,UNH,2023-02-03,Why you should stop caring about the Dow Jones Industrial Average,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-you-should-stop-caring-about-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-123704514.html,1675427824,STORY,['UNH'],"[Have you ever wondered why trillions of investment dollars are indexed to the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 (^GSPC) Index but almost nothing, relatively speaking, is tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI)?Go no further than yesterday’s market. (Feb. 2)The S&amp;P was up a very nice 1.47% for the day while the Dow finished down 0.11%. And guess what? A single stock, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), accounted for a good part of that difference because of the hinky way that the Dow is calculated.As we’ll see in a bit, the difference between the way the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) are calculated and the way the Dow is calculated account for most of the huge differences we saw between the two indices and the Dow last year—and the huge differences we’re seeing so far this year.Or for that matter, this week.For the first four days of the week, the Nasdaq was up 5%, in good part because Meta (META), which was formerly Facebook, was up 23% on Thursday. The S&amp;P was up 2.7%, the Dow barely broke even, up a mere 0.2%. (Even if we took UnitedHealth out of our calculations, the Dow would have been up only 0.5%.)The fact that one stock like UnitedHealthcare—which isn’t exactly a famous household name—can have such a big impact distorts perceptions. And it’s a reason that you shouldn’t pay much attention to the Dow, no matter how much market commentators talk about it.Now, let’s go back to UnitedHealth and I’ll show you the way it whacked the Dow on Thursday at market close when it fell $26.12, which shaved a whopping 172 points off the Dow. That’s more than four times the Dow’s 39-point loss for the day.How can one stock have such a big impact on the Dow?It’s because the Dow is an average—not an index.When the Dow first started, in 1885, it was calculated by adding up the prices of its 12 stocks and dividing it by 12. Back then, that was the only way to calculate a market indicator. But these days, there’s lots more information—such as the total market value of individual stocks—available almost instantaneously than there was 138 years ago.Story continuesThat’s how Standard &amp; Poor’s created the S&amp;P 500 in 1956 and the National Association of Securities Dealers founded the Nasdaq in 1971.The Dow, by contrast, is still an average. But calculating it gets complicated. You add up the prices of its 30 component stocks and divide the sum by something called the Dow divisor. These days, the divisor—which we’ll discuss some other time—is precisely 0.15172752595384, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Traders work on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., January 27, 2023. REUTERS/Andrew KellyA $1 change in any of the Dow’s 30 stocks moves the Dow by 1 divided by the divisor. Or, for our purposes, 6.59 points.At $470.83 a share, UnitedHealth is the Dow’s highest-priced stock. By far. So a $1 move in UnitedHealth is pretty much meaningless to holders of UnitedHealthcare—but for the Dow, that $1 change counts the same as a $1 move in Apple. In the S&amp;P 500, which is based on each of its stocks’ market value, a $1 move in Apple (AAPL) counts about 17 times as much as a $1 move in UnitedHealth. That’s because Apple has about 16 billion shares outstanding, compared with 947 million shares for UnitedHealth.The difference between the way the S&amp;P index is calculated and the way the 30-stock Dow average is calculated is why investors flock to S&amp;P index funds and almost totally ignore the Dow. That’s because the S&amp;P is a better reflection of market reality than the Dow is.The most recent available numbers—from year-end 2021—showed $7.1 trillion indexed to the S&amp;P and just under $40 billion tied to the Dow. But even though the Dow has approximately zero market share when it comes to investors’ money, it’s got huge mindshare. When you read or see or hear daily stock market stories, the Dow is always in there, often the first indicator mentioned.Last year, the Dow outperformed the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq by stunning margins. The Nasdaq was down a distressing 34% and the S&amp;P, which has both over-the counter (OTC) stocks and stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange, was down 19%, but the Dow was down only about 9%. That’s largely because a handful of big stocks that aren’t in the Dow—but have serious weight in the S&amp;P and huge weight in the Nasdaq—got clobbered last year.A few examples: Tesla (TSLA) was down 65%, Meta was down 64%, Amazon (AMZN) was down 49%, Alphabet (GOOG), which was formerly Google, was down 39%.This year, the pattern has reversed. Through yesterday, thanks largely the recent sharp rise in many of those four stocks and some other big stocks that tanked in ’22, the Nasdaq was up 17% year to date, the S&amp;P was up 9%, the Dow up a mere 3%.Are these wide differences among the three major market indicators going to continue this year? I don’t know, nobody knows. But I do know that although the Dow is a sort of outdated relic, it’s hard to resist writing about it. After all, it’s the market indicator we’ve all grown up hearing about.So listen to the Dow news all you like—just don’t care about it. And don’t let it influence your investment decisions.Allan Sloan, who has written about business for more than 50 years, is a seven-time winner of the Gerald Loeb Award, business journalism’s highest honor.

The stocks were left for dead last year as mortgage rates jumped over 7%. Sales of existing, and new homes, plunged virtually overnight.Wall Street thought the homebuilders were doomed with higher mortgage rates. Many people believed that this could be a replay of 2008 with inventory soaring, foreclosures and short sales, and prices plunging. The last place you would want to be in 2008 2.0 is in the homebuilder stocks.Has Housing Already Bottomed?But rates have come down off 2022 highs and the 30-year fixed is around 6%. According to some of the national, publicly-traded, homebuilders demand has picked up again. Is it a boom time again? No. But orders aren’t as bad as last year.Even more importantly, homebuilder margins are remaining elevated as lumber prices have fallen and other material costs have come down even though the builders are giving out more incentives, cutting prices and doing mortgage rate buydowns.The “Hope” TradeThe homebuilder stocks have rallied over the last 3 months on the “hope” trade for the spring season but they remain cheap on a P/E basis.Story continuesShould investors be diving back into the homebuilder stocks?3 Cheap Homebuilder Stocks1. PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM)PulteGroup is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States. When it reports earnings, Wall Street listens.PulteGroup recently reported Q4 2022 but it did not give guidance for the full year of 2023. It only gave margin guidance for Q1. PulteGroup saw demand rise very month in Q4, as well as the first full month of Q1, which was Jan 2023.Shares of PulteGroup surged 41% in the last 3 months but are still cheap, with a forward P/E of just 7.4.

Horton is another large, national homebuilder which also recently reported earnings. The analysts clearly don’t know what to do with the homebuilders. 3 estimates were revised higher and 4 were lowered for fiscal 2023 in the week after D.R. Horton reported earnings.The full year Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to $9.34 from $12.63 in the last 90 days. That’s a decline of 43.4% as D.R. Horton made $16.50 in fiscal 2022.Shares of D.R. Horton are up 25% over the last 3 months but it, too, remains cheap on a P/E basis at just 10x.Should investors be taking a look at D.R. Horton this spring?3. Lennar Corp. (LEN)Lennar’s shares are hitting a new 52-week high as the bulls pile into the homebuilder stocks. Year-to-date, shares are up 13.1% and over the last 3-months, they have surged 25%.But Lennar’s earnings are expected to fall as well in 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to $9.03 from $12.31 in the last 60 days.

(NASDAQ:PFG) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 31st of March, with investors receiving $0.64 per share. This makes the dividend yield 2.8%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Principal Financial Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, Principal Financial Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 61.9%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 33%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendPrincipal Financial Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.72 total annually to $2.56. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 14% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Principal Financial Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 29% per annum. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like Principal Financial Group's DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Principal Financial Group might even raise payments in the future. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

What typically stays constant are those traditions.""I still take my parents to the market to buy flowers and food, eat sweet dumplings with my family, and prepare red pockets for my relatives-all things we did when I was a child,"" says Jennifer Wong, senior manager of pension sales and distribution for Principal Hong Kong. Her memories and that routine are grounded first and foremost by a feeling of togetherness. ""Lunar New Year is full of joy and laughter.""Many traditions that guide people like Gu and Wong arose from myth and legend. One says that about 3,500 years ago, people were forced to hide from a monster that emerged every New Year's Eve. One day, a boy scared him away with firecrackers, thus ushering in good luck. Other customs include:Story continuesTraveling great distances to see family, typically for the Lunar New Year dinner. In China, the seven days starting with the Lunar New Year are a national holiday.Refraining from showering or sweeping until the end of celebrations, in order to preserve good luck.Gifting ""lucky"" money in red envelopes, or pockets, signifying good fortune. The color is also thought to scare away that monster.Eating dumplings, usually every day but absolutely on the morning following the new year when everyone has stayed up all night.A celebration connecting humanityMany who don't celebrate the Lunar New Year have nonetheless heard of the zodiac animals associated with the holiday. For example, this Lunar New Year, which began January 22, 2023, is the year of the rabbit.For Fei Li a marketing manager with Principal China, who was born in mainland China, the rabbit holds special significance: It's the animal of her birth year. ""According to tradition, I have red socks to keep bad luck underfoot, and I pray for peace and good luck,"" she says.Pre-COVID, her Beijing coworkers put up spring decorations and hosted a party, while her family typically played games such as mahjong to pass the twilight hours of the Lunar New Year. Technology (and time) has meant continually adapting those traditions for families such as Li's, but what holds constant is using the Lunar New Year to think about ""out with the old, in with the new,"" she says.At 19, Gu left China to attend Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, an experience he calls ""transformational."" "" It taught me that it's both important to have an open and curious mind about what people from other cultures do, and maintain that cultural connectivity to my family heritage as an anchor,"" he says. ""We all do things differently.""Five cities and three countries later, Gu joined Principal in Iowa, back where his U.S. journey began two decades ago. Today, despite the long distance and pandemic challenges, technology enables him to connect with parents and relatives still living in China. He's also found a supportive global community at work. ""Here, all cultures are celebrated and respected. I've had fun conversations with U.S. colleagues on the Chinese zodiacs, lovely Lunar New Year greetings in Mandarin from partners and clients overseas, and kind recommendations of new local Asian food spots to try from coworkers,"" he says.He's also passing along traditions to his children. ""You can shorten the distance both for family and for people with different cultures to build commonality about what we're celebrating-family, the hope for good fortune, for example-to emphasize our shared humanity and have a more balanced view of the world,"" Gu says. ""While nothing compares to my childhood memory of Grandma's new year cooking with families, being surrounded by such awesome people at Principal, I feel home.""Read more about the commitment to global inclusion at Principal.2691800-0120231LA TimesPrincipal Financial Group, Thursday, February 2, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Principal Financial Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Principal Financial GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/principal-financial-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Principal Financial GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/737880/Lunar-New-Year-A-Meaningful-Global-Celebration]"

The continuous interest rate hikes have made investors anxious about the stock market’s future. According to Bloomberg’s MLIV Pulse survey conducted in January, investors broadly gave a pessimistic view of the market. However, over half of the respondents showed an inclination toward cheaper value stocks, considering their outperformance over growth equities in 2022. In addition to this, companies that have proven track records of dividend growth also made it to investors’ choice.Value stocks showed their greatest performance last year against growth equities since 2000, as reported by Bloomberg. Analysts expect the trend of value investing to continue this year as higher interest rates put margin pressures on the technology sector. Moreover, last year’s selloff was the worst for tech stocks since 2008, so investors are moving toward defensive quality stocks to stay afloat during this period. In this regard, dividend stocks regained their appeal, with dividend payments reaching their record high in 2022. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, compared with $511.2 billion in 2021. The report also mentioned that 373 companies in the S&amp;P 500 raised their dividend through December 15, up from 353 in 2021. These results show that companies have the sufficient cash flow to fulfill their shareholder obligation smoothly.AbbVie Inc.

If you want to read about some more hot EV stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Hot EV Stocks To Buy Now.The electric vehicle (EV) industry was heavily impacted by the economic downturn in 2022. As interest rates increased and financial markets fluctuated, the stock prices of many EV firms declined. This was a disappointing year for investors who had invested in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and other companies with high exposure to the EV industry. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), which had a market value higher than Ford Motor Co. shortly after going public in 2021, lost over 70% of its value in the past year.The situation for EV start-ups was even direr. Arrival, an electric van manufacturer, warned that it could run out of cash in less than a year. Lucid Group Inc. (LCID.O), supported by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, encountered difficulties in constructing its luxurious Air EVs. Xpeng Inc., a Chinese competitor to Tesla, saw its shares decrease in value by over 80%. However, despite these challenges, the outlook for the EV industry in 2023 is optimistic. According to Reuters, despite low sales, electric vehicle production is set to surge in 2023. In 2022, well-established automobile manufacturers such as Mercedes, Ford, and General Motors introduced numerous new electric vehicles to compete with Tesla and other start-ups. The ramp-up of mass production for these vehicles will commence in 2023. Tesla Inc. rises to become the top-valued automobile company globally with a market share of 65%. The total EV industry is worth around $800 billion as of right now.According to S&amp;P Global, the market share for electric vehicles in new vehicle sales is predicted to reach 40% by 2030. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk, has stated that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be the most valuable company in the world. During the most recent earnings call, Elon Musk reported that the company saw its strongest orders to date in January. The last quarter also marked Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s highest-ever quarterly revenue, operating income, and net income in its history. Additionally, Tesla cut global EV prices by up to 20%, intensifying competition through aggressive discounts.Story continuesGovernments around the world are also supporting the growth of the EV industry through incentives and regulations. The push towards sustainable transportation is increasing, which is expected to further drive the growth of the EV industry in the coming years. The market for charging infrastructure is also expected to grow, creating new opportunities for companies in this sector.The increasing demand for EVs is also expected to drive growth in the lithium-ion battery market. A report by Technavio predicts that the global lithium-ion battery market will grow by 17% in 2023, driven by the increasing demand for EVs and energy storage systems. The industry is also expected to see growth in the recycling and reuse of batteries, as companies look for ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability.Our MethodologyFor this article we first used stock screeners to identify EV stocks that have posted positive share price gains in 2023 so far and have an average 3-month volume of more than 5 million as of January 31. From this resultant dataset we picked the stocks with highest volumes and share price gains.

Over the past several years, GM has taken the steps necessary to focus the company on the most profitable segments and move into a position to compete in an electrified and autonomous world. With the recent rise in interest rates, there was a meaningful selloff in the auto industry, which presented us an attractive entry point to a name we know well.” 6. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30  Avg Volume: 20.3M YTD Perf: +5.26%Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and accessories.

(NASDAQ:RIVN) with 19.6 million shares worth more than $645 million. In addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

(NASDAQ:RIVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) manufactures electric vehicles (EVs) for the consumer and commercial markets. We initially invested in the company when it was privately owned. Among the many things that differentiate this startup is its substantial cash balance and relationship with Amazon, which is both an investor in the company and the first customer for Rivian’s commercial van. Several positive developments contributed to share strength in the quarter, including the company’s announcement that production of its R1 pickup trucks and EV delivery vans increased nearly 70% over the previous quarter. Management also reaffirmed its production target of 25,000 vehicles for 2022. Despite raising the price of its R1 truck earlier this year, Rivian continued to see strong demand for its vehicles, demonstrated by 98,000 pre-orders for its R1 truck and SUV. Although we are pleased with the company’s progress, we liquidated our position as Rivian approached the high end of our market cap threshold and its relative valuation became less attractive.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Hot EV Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

Investing in these stocks comes with a higher risk but can prove very rewarding in the long run. With this in mind, it is important to research and screen the right aggressive growth stocks to buy.Aggressive growth stocks are high-risk, high-reward investments that can provide investors with the potential for significant returns. These stocks are characterized by their rapid growth rate and often have a higher market capitalization than other stocks in the same sector. Investors should look for companies with strong fundamentals and positive earnings to identify an aggressive growth stock. Additionally, investors should consider factors such as competitive advantages and industry trends when evaluating potential aggressive growth stocks to buy.At the start of 2023, the stock market experienced a noticeable value rise. Investors are eagerly watching to see if the rally will continue or if it was a one-time event.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFinancial institutions anticipate the Federal Reserve to hike rates by 0.25% on Feb. 1, 2023, with the potential rate range of 4.5%-4.75%. We have seen rate hikes in the last year, which have impacted the markets tremendously.In addition, the latest data released by the government showed that the residential starts dropped to a five-month low of 1.38 million at an annualized rate, registering a decrease of 1.4% from last month’s figures. The U.S. housing market condition has a major influence on the stock market. Its weakened state will undeniably affect it significantly.When selecting stocks with aggressive growth potential, it is necessary to prioritize quality over sensationalism. It might not be the most riveting option, but in a constantly changing market, opting for the best performers could be vital.Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy: Airbnb (ABNB)Person holding Airbnb logo over the cityscape of Rome, Italy. ABNB stock.Source: Kaspars Grinvalds / ShutterstockStory continuesInvestors increasingly view Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) as a lucrative investment, rendering it one of the most desirable stocks. With its impressive growth rate and strong market position, Airbnb has become one of the best aggressive growth stocks to buy. The company offers a unique business model to capture large markets with minimal capital expenditure. Additionally, its innovative hospitality and customer service approach has made it an attractive option for many investors.In December 2020, Airbnb’s initial public offering was $68 a share. Upon opening for trading in early 2021, the stock skyrocketed to a peak of $219.94. However, after that time, it has been progressively declining to settle under $90 by early 2023.Airbnb is taking a proactive stance in these difficult times. It has introduced a new fee structure to enhance guests’ experiences, which includes service, cleaning, and rental fees. Airbnb has made its fees transparent with a variable rental fee and two fixed fees, a positive change from its history of hidden charges.Airbnb also acts against hosts who implement unreasonable house rules, such as requiring guests to vacuum the entire house before leaving. They are now only allowing those that are deemed necessary and reasonable. Utilizing this would help to guarantee a pleasant and uniform experience for Airbnb customers.On the financial side, everything looks great for the vacation rental platform. During the three months ending September 2022, its latest earnings report revealed a high demand for its accommodations, as nightly bookings and rates went up. The company reported record-high EBITDA and FCF growth of 80% from the previous year.Considering the current market, Airbnb is an excellent choice of stock to invest in — its aggressive nature makes it a beneficial option for potential buyers.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is one of the most aggressive growth stocks. The company is a global leader in producing copper, gold, and molybdenum. It has been steadily increasing its presence in the mining industry by expanding its operations into new regions. With its focus on long-term growth, FCX has generated impressive returns for investors over the past few years. Additionally, FCX is well-positioned to benefit from increased demand for metals as the global economy recovers from the pandemic.Freeport-McMoRan is the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer and a noteworthy producer of gold and molybdenum. Despite the inherent risks, investors who put their money into copper have seen a significant payoff. Freeport-McMoRan’s outstanding performance in the past year stands out from the other listed stocks in an otherwise challenging market.The global economy faces various risks, such as the war in Ukraine, the increase in interest rates, lockdown restrictions in China, and the effect that sanctions on Russian energy are having on Europe’s industrial sector. These issues all contribute to a volatile macroeconomic environment.China has recently lifted its lockdown policies, which have unfortunately caused a major financial loss for them and destabilized the global market. But now that the restrictions are lifting, we will see healthy trends in the price of copper. However, bullish global trends can power the stock upward in 2023. With the world’s economy being interlinked, what benefits China often has a positive effect on other parts of the world, and this holds for copper demand too. Thus, China’s growth can be a boon to copper producers around the globe.Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy: MercadoLibre (MELI)MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comLatin America’s e-commerce and digital payments markets are showing great growth potential, and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is well-positioned to be the leader in these industries for the foreseeable future.Despite the strong recovery in MercadoLibre stock from its heavy losses in 2022, it remains slightly lower than its previous peak.MercadoLibre reported excellent numbers for fiscal Q3 2022, with net revenues rocketing by 60.6% compared to the previous year reaching a whopping $2.7 billion.

Every metric improved, including active users and total payment volume.The future is bright for the company. MercadoLibre is dominating its biggest Brazilian rival, Americanas S.A., due to its accounting scandal that led to the firing of its leadership. As a result, in 2023, MercadoLibre will continue to gain market share.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see more famous alumni, check out The 10 Most Famous Yale Students Of All Time. Yale University has the second largest university endowment globally and is known for having one of the top-performing investment portfolios in US higher education. The endowment at Yale University was established in 1718 with a starting amount of £562 from Elihu Yale. Over the past 300 years, it has grown to a value exceeding $40 billion and is overseen by the Yale Investments Office.Yale's InvestmentsThe Yale Investments Office's innovative use of modern portfolio theory to create a well-diversified investment portfolio has resulted in steady growth with lower risk, reinforcing Yale's strong financial position. Over the past several decades, Yale's investment returns have added tens of billions of dollars in value compared to a benchmark strategy that divides investments 60% into stocks and 40% into bonds.Yale's endowment saw a 0.8% return on investment, after subtracting fees, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, resulting in $266 million in investment gains. Following the distribution of $1.6 billion for spending to the operating budget, the endowment value dropped from $42.3 billion on June 30, 2021 to $41.4 billion on June 30, 2022. Matt Mendelsohn, Yale’s chief investment officer, said in a report dated October 4, 2022:“In such a volatile year for the world’s financial markets, we are pleased to have protected Yale’s capital. That said, we expect challenging times ahead as rising interest rates, inflation, and the geopolitical environment provide stiff headwinds.”Yale’s investment strategy is designed to achieve its goals through allotment across multiple asset classes, including public equities, marketable alternatives, leveraged buyouts, venture capital, and real assets. This investment approach has yielded impressive long-term outcomes, as Yale's endowment saw an annual return of 12.0% in the decade ending on June 30, 2022, outpacing the average 10-year return of college and university endowments by 3.4% per annum. At the end of September 2022, Yale’s investment portfolio held positions in Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund (NYSE:VWO), PROCEPT BioRobotics Corporation (NASDAQ:PRCT), iShares MSCI Turkey ETF (NASDAQ:TUR), and Riley Exploration Permian, Inc.

473,b1f06a6f-a0cc-3c4f-b086-e7adfc73d957,PEP,2023-02-03,PepsiCo (PEP) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-pep-earnings-expected-grow-150003609.html,1675350003,STORY,['PEP'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when PepsiCo (PEP) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis food and beverage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.2%.Revenues are expected to be $26.82 billion, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.69% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PepsiCo?For PepsiCo, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.38%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PepsiCo will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PepsiCo would post earnings of $1.85 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.97, delivering a surprise of +6.49%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PepsiCo doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Effective July 1, 2022, the Company began recording net product sales of Libtayo outside the United States. Excluded from this line item is approximately $17 million and $34 million of net product sales recorded by Sanofi in the fourth quarter and second half of 2022, respectively, in connection with sales in certain markets (Sanofi will record net product sales in such markets during a transition period until inventory on hand as of July 1, 2022 is sold through to the end customers).*** Effective April 1, 2021, Kiniksa records net product sales of ARCALYST in the United States. Previously, the Company recorded net product sales of ARCALYST in the United States.Net product sales of EYLEA in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2022 were negatively impacted by (i) a short-term shift to off-label use of compounded bevacizumab, (ii) a temporary closing in the fourth quarter of 2022 of a not-for-profit fund that provides patient co-pay assistance, and (iii) an increase in sales-related deductions. Volumes of U.S. EYLEA in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.There were no sales of REGEN-COV in the U.S. during 2022 as the Company had completed its final deliveries of drug product under its agreements with the U.S. government as of December 31, 2021.Sanofi collaboration revenue increased 61% to $836 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and increased 50% to $2.856 billion for the full year 2022, compared to the full year 2021. This increase was primarily due to the Company's share of profits from commercialization of antibodies, which were $619 million and $388 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $2.082 billion and $1.363 billion for full year 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in the Company's share of profits from commercialization of antibodies was driven by profits associated with higher Dupixent sales. In addition, during 2022 the Company earned two $50 million sales-based milestones (including one in the fourth quarter of 2022) from Sanofi based upon sales of antibodies outside the U.S. on a rolling twelve-month basis, compared to earning one $50 million sales-based milestone in 2021 (in the third quarter of 2021).Sanofi and Bayer collaboration revenue (and specifically, the share of profits the Company earned in connection with commercialization of products) was adversely impacted in 2022 by the U.S. dollar strengthening against foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen and the euro.The Company recorded Roche collaboration revenue during full year 2022 and 2021 in connection with payments from Roche attributable to global gross profits from sales of Ronapreve. Roche collaboration revenue increased in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, as no Roche collaboration revenue was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021 since the Company owed a payment to Roche (which was recorded to Cost of goods sold) in connection with global gross profits of REGEN-COV and Ronapreve.Refer to Table 4 for a summary of collaboration revenue.Operating Expenses  GAAP %Change Non-GAAP(a) %Change($ in millions) Q4 2022 Q4 2021  Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Research and development (R&amp;D)** $1,043  $738  41%  $911  $635  43% Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D)** $30  $48  (38%)  *   *  n/a Selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) $661  $560  18%  $579  $495  17% Cost of goods sold (COGS) $302  $812  (63%) $126  $559  (77%)Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing (COCM) $238  $171  39%   *   *  n/a Other operating (income) expense, net $(7) $(16) (56%)  *   *  n/a   GAAP %Change Non-GAAP(a) %Change  FY 2022 FY 2021  FY 2022 FY 2021 Research and development** $3,593  $2,860  26%  $3,169  $2,544  25% Acquired in-process research and development** $255  $48  431%   *   *  n/a Selling, general, and administrative $2,116  $1,825  16%  $1,853  $1,606  15% Cost of goods sold $800  $1,773  (55%) $507  $1,470  (66%)Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing $760  $664  14%   *   *  n/a Other operating (income) expense, net $(90) $(46) 96%   *   *  n/a              * GAAP and non-GAAP amounts are equivalent as no non-GAAP adjustments have been recorded.** Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform with the current period's presentation. See note (f) below for additional information.GAAP and non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses increased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by the impact of the 2022 amendments to the Sanofi collaboration agreements, additional costs incurred in connection with the Company's late-stage pipeline, an increase in clinical manufacturing activities, and higher headcount and headcount-related costs. The increase for the full year of 2022, compared to full year 2021, was partly offset by lower costs incurred in connection with development activities for REGEN-COV and fasinumab.Acquired IPR&amp;D for full year 2022 included a $195 million charge related to the Company's acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a $30 million up-front payment in connection with the Company's collaboration agreement with CytomX (fourth quarter 2022), and a $20 million opt-in payment in connection with a product candidate under the Company's collaboration agreement with Adicet Bio, Inc. Acquired IPR&amp;D for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 included $34 million in aggregate up-front payments in connection with the Company's collaboration agreement with Nykode Therapeutics.GAAP and non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses increased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in commercialization-related expenses for Libtayo (as effective July 1, 2022, the Company became solely responsible for the commercialization of Libtayo worldwide), higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization, and higher headcount and headcount-related costs, partly offset by educational campaigns related to COVID-19 that did not recur during 2022.GAAP and non-GAAP COGS decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the Company recognizing U.S. REGEN-COV net product sales (and corresponding cost of goods sold) during 2021 and a 2021 payment of $260 million owed by the Company in connection with global gross profits under its Roche collaboration agreement; such transactions did not recur in 2022. GAAP and non-GAAP COGS also decreased in 2022 since effective July 1, 2022, following the acquisition of Libtayo worldwide rights, the Company is no longer obligated to pay Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross profits.GAAP COGS also decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 due to lower inventory write-offs and reserves. Non-GAAP COGS excluded certain charges related to REGEN-COV (primarily inventory write-offs and reserves) of $134 million and $197 million in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, respectively, and $232 million in each of the fourth quarter and full year of 2021.Other operating (income) expense, net, for full year 2022 included the recognition of $44 million (an increase to other operating income) as a result of discontinuing further clinical development of fasinumab related to the Company's Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma collaborative arrangements.Other Financial InformationGAAP other income (expense) included the recognition of net unrealized gains on equity securities of $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $138 million of net unrealized losses in the fourth quarter of 2021. GAAP other income (expense) included the recognition of net unrealized losses on equity securities of $40 million for full year 2022, compared to net unrealized gains of $386 million for full year 2021.In the fourth quarter and full year 2022, the Company's GAAP effective tax rate (ETR) was 9.6% and 10.7%, respectively, compared to 11.0% and 13.4% in the fourth quarter and full year 2021, respectively. The GAAP ETR in the fourth quarter and full year 2022, compared to the same periods in the prior year, included a higher benefit from the proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate (including the impact from REGEN-COV income earned in the U.S. during 2021). In the fourth quarter and full year 2022, the non-GAAP ETR was 11.3% and 12.1%, respectively, compared to 12.6% and 13.5% in the fourth quarter and full year 2021, respectively.GAAP net income per diluted share was $10.50 in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $19.69 in the fourth quarter of 2021. GAAP net income per diluted share was $38.22 for the full year 2022, compared to $71.97 for full year 2021. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $12.56 in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $23.42 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $44.98 for the full year 2022, compared to $74.35 for the full year 2021. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.During the full year 2022, the Company repurchased shares of common stock under its share repurchase program, and recorded the cost of the shares, or $2.100 billion, as Treasury Stock. As of December 31, 2022, $745 million remained available for share repurchases under the program. In January 2023, the Company's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional $3.0 billion of the Company's common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time at management's discretion through a variety of methods. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time.2023 Financial Guidance(c)The Company's full year 2023 financial guidance consists of the following components:  2023 GuidanceGAAP R&amp;D $4.200–$4.435 billionNon-GAAP R&amp;D(a) $3.725–$3.925 billionGAAP SG&amp;A $2.460–$2.650 billionNon-GAAP SG&amp;A(a) $2.130–$2.280 billionGAAP gross margin on net product sales(d) 88%–90%Non-GAAP gross margin on net product sales(a)(d) 90%–92%COCM(e)* $720–$800 millionCapital expenditures* $825–$950 millionGAAP effective tax rate 10%–12%Non-GAAP effective tax rate(a) 11%–13%   * GAAP and non-GAAP amounts are equivalent as no non-GAAP adjustments have been or are expected to be recorded.A reconciliation of full year 2023 GAAP to non-GAAP financial guidance is included below:  Projected Range($ in millions) Low HighGAAP R&amp;D $4,200  $4,435 Stock-based compensation expense  470   500 Acquisition-related integration costs  5   10 Non-GAAP R&amp;D $3,725  $3,925      GAAP SG&amp;A $2,460  $2,650 Stock-based compensation expense  310   330 Acquisition-related integration costs  20   40 Non-GAAP SG&amp;A $2,130  $2,280      GAAP gross margin on net product sales  88%   90% Stock-based compensation expense  1%   1% Intangible asset amortization expense  1%   1% Non-GAAP gross margin on net product sales  90%   92%      GAAP ETR  10%   12% Income tax effect of GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items  1%   1% Non-GAAP ETR  11%   13% (a)This press release uses non-GAAP R&amp;D, non-GAAP SG&amp;A, non-GAAP COGS, non-GAAP gross margin on net product sales, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP ETR, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, total revenues excluding REGEN-COV and Ronapreve, and free cash flow, which are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain non-cash and/or other items from the related GAAP financial measure. The Company also includes a non-GAAP adjustment for the estimated income tax effect of reconciling items. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.The Company makes such adjustments for items the Company does not view as useful in evaluating its operating performance. For example, adjustments may be made for items that fluctuate from period to period based on factors that are not within the Company's control (such as the Company's stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued or changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities) or items that are not associated with normal, recurring operations (such as restructuring- or integration-related expenses). Management uses these non-GAAP measures for planning, budgeting, forecasting, assessing historical performance, and making financial and operational decisions, and also provides forecasts to investors on this basis. With respect to free cash flows, the Company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides a further measure of the Company’s operations' ability to generate cash flows. Additionally, such non-GAAP measures provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company's core business operations. However, there are limitations in the use of these and other non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain expenses that are recurring in nature. Furthermore, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Any non-GAAP financial measure presented by Regeneron should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  (b)The casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail for COVID-19 is known as REGEN-COV in the United States and Ronapreve in other countries. The Company records net product sales of REGEN-COV in the United States and Roche records net product sales of Ronapreve outside the United States.  (c)The Company's 2023 financial guidance does not assume the completion of any significant business development transactions not completed as of the date of this press release.  (d)Gross margin on net product sales represents gross profit expressed as a percentage of total net product sales recorded by the Company. Gross profit is calculated as net product sales less cost of goods sold.  (e)Corresponding reimbursements from collaborators and others for manufacturing of commercial supplies is recorded within revenues.  (f)Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, the Company added Acquired in-process research and development as a new line item to its Statements of Operations, which includes IPR&amp;D acquired in connection with asset acquisitions as well as up-front/opt-in payments related to license and collaboration agreements. Amounts recorded in this line would have historically been recorded to Research and development expenses. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period's presentation.

Legal claims that heartburn drug Zantac caused cancer have also weighed on the stock.Analysts have said that this year's expected market debut of two new products, to balance out reliance on Dupixent, would be important tests of the company's marketing prowess and a chance to regain investor confidence.Story continuesThese products are haemophilia A treatment Altuviiio, requiring fewer injections than standard therapy, and Beyfortus from a partnership with AstraZeneca, which is a preventive once-a-year shot against the common RSV airways infection in infants.But for this year, marketing and sales expenses to boost those launches would drag earnings lower, finance chief Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said in a media briefing.'HOME-GROWN INNOVATION'Chief Executive Paul Hudson pushed back when asked in a press conference whether Sanofi was too dependant on Dupixent.""When you don’t have a mega-blockbuster people say: don’t you need a mega-blockbuster to be a success?"" he said, adding the intellectual property on the product with multiple uses was protected beyond 2031.""We understand the requirement to be ready for the 2030s and beyond and we’d like to see more of our own home-grown innovation accelerate,"" said Hudson.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.74 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Quest Diagnostics: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

490,cb5e12e6-76bb-311d-9562-f47daa6fb32b,AMP,2023-02-03,3 Momentum Stocks Backed by the Driehaus Strategy to Invest in,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-momentum-stocks-backed-driehaus-112411313.html,1675423451,STORY,"['URI', 'AMP', 'KOF']","[The Driehaus strategy can be used to choose the best momentum stocks with the “buy high and sell higher"" theory. No doubt, it’s a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like Coca Cola Femsa KOF, United Rentals URI, and Ameriprise Financial AMP have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening ParametersIn order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Story continues• Zacks Rank equal to #1No matter whether the market is good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 have a proven history of outperformance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Nucor Corp. NUE, Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD, United Rentals Inc. URI and Ameriprise Financial Inc. AMP.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Momentum Stock for February After a Strong JanuaryWall Street ended the first month of 2023 with a solid rally after a highly disappointing 2022. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — appreciated 2.8%, 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 closed their third positive month in four. The S&amp;P 500 posted the best January since 2019. The Nasdaq Composite ended the best month since July and the best January since 2001.Favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic data and a resilient labor market raised market participants’ hope for a soft landing of the U.S. economy. At this stage, it should be profitable to invest in momentum stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Five such stocks are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Nucor Corp., Steel Dynamics Inc.,United Rentals Inc. and Ameriprise Financial Inc.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Story continuesPeak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.Other PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five momentum stocks. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions over the last seven days, which indicates that the market is expecting these companies to do solid business in 2023. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Momentum Score of A.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer-Daniels-Midland Steady growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth going forward.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.7% over the last seven days.Nucor is committed to expanding its production capabilities and growing its business through strategic acquisitions.

NUE is also seeing strong momentum in the non-residential construction market and strong demand in the heavy equipment market.Nucor remains focused on achieving greater penetration of the automotive market because of the segment’s long-term growth opportunities. Higher steel prices due to tight supply and higher end-market demand should also drive NUE’s margins.

The acquisitions of Heartland and United Steel Supply have boosted Steel Dynamics' shipping capabilities.

URI has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AppHarvest APPH, Lucira Health LHDX, Lucid Group LCID, Life Time Group Holdings LTH and Ameriprise Financial AMP.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Big Winners as Wall Street Wraps Up Strong January GainsAfter a dismal 2022, Wall Street concluded the first month of 2023 with healthy gains. The Dow Jones Market Data added that the S&amp;P 500 has soared 6.2% so far this year, notching its best January gains since 2019. Lest we forget, the broader index, particularly, had a painful 2022, with the index tanking nearly 20% and registering its worst annual performance since the financial crisis way back in 2008.The Dow, meanwhile, gained 2.8% for the month of January, and the tech-laden Nasdaq surged 10.7%, marking its best January performance since 2001, added the Dow Jones Market Data. Interestingly, the rally in tech comes despite bigwigs executing layoffs and other cost-cutting measures.A slowdown in U.S. pay growth gave upside support for stocks. Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, wages and benefits increased by 1% in the final three months of 2022, but that’s less than the 1.2% increase during the July-September quarter.Thus, a slowdown in wage growth is expected not to fuel inflation higher and has given assurance that the Federal Reserve won’t be accelerating its interest rate hikes this year. Needless to say, the rate hikes last year to tame sky-high inflation had increased the cost of borrowing, curtailed consumer spending, and derailed economic growth.Last year, in December, interest rates were hiked by 50- basis- points, which followed a 75-basis-point increase four times consecutively. But now market pundits are expecting a rate increase by only 25 basis points this month. This is primarily because inflation has started to show signs of cooling off, with the consumer price index advancing by 6.5% year-over-year in December, down from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June.Story continuesThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), by the way, now expects global economic growth to increase by 2.9% this year, more than its October estimate of a 2.7% rise. The IMF believes that an upbeat labor market, improvement in consumption patterns, and the reopening of the Chinese economy following the coronavirus pandemic would surely boost economic growth and crush recessionary concerns. IMF’s upbeat outlook on global economic growth too drove stocks higher and gave enough hope that the rally will last for the rest of 2023.Given such bullishness, we have highlighted five stocks that have not only made the most of the January rally but also are poised to gain further this year, banking on a less aggressive Fed and better global economic growth prospects. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

494,23e32ca9-4f1e-3b5f-b6a6-a0b14c7f9872,CSCO,2023-02-03,Why Cisco (CSCO) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-cisco-csco-poised-beat-171005910.html,1675357805,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Cisco Systems (CSCO), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This seller of routers, switches, software and services has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.80%.For the most recent quarter, Cisco was expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share, but it reported $0.86 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.38%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.82 per share, while it actually produced $0.83 per share, a surprise of 1.22%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Cisco lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Cisco currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.66%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 15, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
