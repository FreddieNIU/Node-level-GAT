So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +15.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which The Charles Schwab Corporation falls in, has gained 5.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to post earnings of $0.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.33 points to a change of -14.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.23 indicates a change of +27% from what The Charles Schwab Corporation is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for The Charles Schwab Corporation.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For The Charles Schwab Corporation, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.76 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -6.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.59 billion and $22.25 billion estimates indicate -5.6% and +13.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryThe Charles Schwab Corporation reported revenues of $5.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.5%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.15%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, The Charles Schwab Corporation surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.The Charles Schwab Corporation is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about The Charles Schwab Corporation. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

1,11a355b4-c830-35b9-80d0-b39231b096e0,TXN,2023-06-10,What Does Texas Instruments Incorporated's (NASDAQ:TXN) Share Price Indicate?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-texas-instruments-incorporateds-nasdaq-140026541.html,1686319226,STORY,['TXN'],"[Let's talk about the popular Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$186 and falling to the lows of US$161. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Texas Instruments' current trading price of US$172 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Texas Instruments’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments What's The Opportunity In Texas Instruments?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Texas Instruments’s ratio of 19.03x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 23.41x, which means if you buy Texas Instruments today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe Texas Instruments should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Texas Instruments’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Texas Instruments?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Texas Instruments, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 0.5%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TXN’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at TXN? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TXN, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

2,be39156f-5856-36d8-936d-a00666d2e4cf,TXN,2023-06-10,10 Semiconductor Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-semiconductor-stocks-billionaires-loading-134259688.html,1686318179,STORY,"['INTC', 'AVGO', 'NXPI', 'MU', 'TXN', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'TSM']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 semiconductor stocks billionaires are loading up on. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Semiconductor Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.The advancement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is expected to bring new opportunities for the semiconductor industry. According to Fortune Business Insights, the size of the global semiconductor industry is expected to rise from $573.4 billion in 2022 to $1,380.8 billion in 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 12.2%. The storage sub-industry in the semiconductor industry will experience the highest tailwinds in terms of top-line and bottom-line increase from the advancements in AI and ML. Meanwhile, the computing, memory, and networking solutions sub-industries will have a favourable outlook as well due to these developments.According to research by McKinsey and Company, the semiconductor industry generates earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $5 billion to $8 billion from the AI and ML industry. It must be noted that these numbers only reflect 10% of the full potential of EBIT that can be generated from these sub-industries. The New York-based management consulting firm expects the number to reach $35 billion to $40 billion annually in the next two to three years. Moving forward, the value is projected to increase further to a range of $85 billion to $95 billion annually four or more years into the future. This would be equivalent to nearly 17% of the expected 2023 annual revenue of $532 billion for the semiconductor industry, according to Gartner.Outlook for Recovery and Future GrowthPresently, the semiconductor industry is experiencing weak demand from both consumers and businesses, driven by economic uncertainty. This has led to an oversupply of chips, resulting in an inventory buildup and a decline in average selling prices (ASPs). As a result, the industry is expected to witness an 11.2% year-over-year (YoY) decline in revenue in 2023. The memory sub-industry is expected to be the worst impacted by the weakness of the overall industry as it is anticipated to see its annual revenue decline by 35.5% in 2023 to a sum of $92.3 billion. Despite the current challenges, there is an expectation of a strong recovery in the semiconductor industry. It is expected that the industry will bounce back in 2024 with a remarkable 70% increase in revenue, indicating a significant turnaround. Some of the best semiconductor stocks in the industry include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).Story continuesA survey by KPMG provides further support to the forecast of oversupply in the semiconductor industry. According to the survey, 24% of the executives believe that the semiconductor industry is already facing the issue of oversupply. Meanwhile, 31% of the respondents believe that the oversupply of chips will take place in 2023. Another 36% of executives believe that the oversupply will take place between 2024 and 2026. The remaining 9% believe that there will be no oversupply in the next four years as demand will be able to keep pace.  The automotive, industrial, civil, and military aerospace industries are expected to be demand generators for the semiconductor industry. According to Gartner, the end market demand for semiconductors from the automotive industry is set to experience a YoY growth of 13.8% in 2023 to total revenue of $76.9 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, KPMG anticipates the automotive sector to generate annual revenue of around $200 billion for the semiconductor industry by the middle of the next decade and cross the $250 billion level by 2040.Shifting Demand Patterns In the future, experts believe that the demand for semiconductors will become less reliant on the PC, tablet, and smartphone end markets. Demand is expected to come from diverse and fragmented markets that would be less exposed to any change in consumer spending, like the PC, tablet, and smartphone end markets, and would be more driven by capital outlay by organizations. The diversification of demand is likely to benefit some of the best semiconductor stocks in the industry. To support and strengthen the semiconductor industry, significant initiatives have been introduced in both the United States and Europe. The introduction of the CHIPS Act in the US intends to direct investment of $280 billion toward the semiconductor industry in the next decade. Around $200 billion will be diverted toward research and development (R&amp;D) and commercialization. Furthermore, the US government intends to give a tax credit of $24 billion under this program. On the other hand, Europe intends to enhance its competitiveness in the semiconductor industry by introducing the European Chips Act (ECA) to attract $45.8 billion (€43 billion) of public and private investment across the continent by 2030.10 Semiconductor Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnPhoto by Umberto on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey’s exclusive database of billionaire hedge fund managers to shortlist the top 10 semiconductor stocks billionaires are loading up on.

According to PwC, while companies and their employees are determining their preferred work arrangements, some firms are choosing to retain their office spaces as a precautionary measure or due to lease obligations. However, an increasing number of companies are downsizing or opting not to renew expiring leases. Consequently, vacancy rates in the office sector continue to rise gradually, which is in contrast to other major property sectors. Additionally, many tenants are resorting to subletting their office spaces until their leases expire. On the other hand, occupancy levels for logistics real estate in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are currently at or near all-time highs. There are also positive indications suggesting that the retail sector is experiencing a revival. Investment managers interviewed by PwC highlighted the robust operational performance of their retail portfolios in the United States and Europe. This upward trend extends beyond the more resilient sub-sectors such as convenience stores, grocery stores, and retail parks. Selected shopping centers are demonstrating strong performance in the market as well. Don't Miss: 20 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USAThe commercial real estate sector continues to face significant economic uncertainty for the remainder of 2023, with several key factors impacting its future. These factors include the uncertain interest rate environment and the evolving nature of office spaces. Over the period from March 2022 to May 2023, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates consistently for ten consecutive times. However, according to JPMorgan, multifamily properties continue to thrive. While the rate of rent increases has declined, the national vacancy rate for multifamily properties was 4.5% at the end of 2022. Vacancy rates vary across different metro areas, but the median vacancy rate in the country as of April stands at 3.9%. Story continuesFurthermore, JPMorgan noted that despite e-commerce comprising around 15% of retail, not all consumer needs can be met online. Certain services, like nail salons, barbershops, and sports bars, still require in-person visits. The industrial sector has experienced significant growth driven by e-commerce and the on-demand economy as well. The vacancy rate for distribution and warehouse spaces hit a record low of 4.1% in the second half of 2022, but it increased slightly to 4.2% in the first quarter of 2023. While demand for office space has been impacted by remote and hybrid work models, A-class office properties continue to perform well, especially those with leases lasting 10 years or more, which may be able to weather market corrections. On the other hand, B- and C-class office buildings, particularly those with shorter leases in non-prime locations, face challenges as the workplace evolves. The real estate industry is undergoing significant changes driven by technology advancements and increased capital. FortuneBuilders observed that online property listing platforms, smartphone apps, virtual reality, and blockchain technology are expected to have a profound impact on real estate transactions. Buyers and renters now have access to online platforms, leading to more informed property searches. Moreover, blockchain technology is likely to be utilized for legal components of transactions, such as transferring deeds and sharing important documents, increasing trust and reducing intermediaries. Virtual reality will also gain popularity, allowing potential buyers to virtually tour properties without physically visiting them. Meanwhile, millennials are entering the real estate market with a preference for suburban areas and walkable neighborhoods, presenting new opportunities for investors in mixed-use and retail spaces. Overall, the future of real estate will be shaped by technological advancements and shifting buyer preferences.In this exciting real estate landscape, some of the best commercial stocks to invest in include CBRE Group, Inc.

However, as the largest public office REIT, it operates in a challenging space due to high capital expenditure needs, the ease of adding new supply and tenant leverage. BXP is also concentrated in large coastal markets that have high taxes and burdensome regulations, and subsequently have seen population outflows. We believe the combination of a tough business and a marginally worse environment given the rising acceptance of at-home work will be challenging over the long term for BXP.”7.

The company owns 5 of the 10 largest convention-oriented resorts under the Gaylord Hotel brand, and it has a small entertainment business which owns iconic assets like the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium. We believe the group-travel business will normalize and potentially be of heightened importance given the increase in remote work. Pandemic-related industry-wide disruptions coupled with the inflationary dynamic in construction should result in minimal new industry capacity over the next five years, favoring Ryman’s portfolio of assets.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy12 Cities Where Home Prices are Going Up Right Now Disclosure: None. 10 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
6,8eb6ee58-f581-3332-b457-f4a83bd5cb14,UNM,2023-06-10,4 Stocks With Low Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio to Buy Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-low-price-cash-124400583.html,1686314640,STORY,"['UNM', 'GM', 'AIG', 'GIII']","[Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential.Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM, American International Group, Inc. AIG and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true-value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 8.4% for three-five years.

On that day, Thermo Fisher Scientific is projected to report earnings of $5.43 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 1.45%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $10.99 billion, up 0.21% from the year-ago period.TMO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $23.69 per share and revenue of $45.3 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +1.94% and +0.86%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Thermo Fisher Scientific. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

8,f126677f-e0f3-3bfb-b44a-45bb96219823,USB,2023-06-10,"Nvidia, Hess valuations have 'gotten ahead' of themselves: Analyst",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-hess-valuations-gotten-ahead-202228173.html,1686342148,VIDEO,"['USB', 'USB-PR', 'T', 'T-PA', 'NVDA', 'HES']","[The AI rally behind tech stocks is pushing Nvidia shares higher, but is it too much, too soon for the chipmaker? Morningstar Chief U.S. Market Strategist David Sekera joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss which companies may be overvalued. Sekera's top stock picks include AT&amp;T and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.Video Transcript- Well, the S&amp;P 500 exiting the bear market territory driven largely by tech. One of the top performers in the sector, of course, is Nvidia. The chip giant up more than 150% so far this year. Our next guest says the stock is overvalued after this run. Joining us now is Morningstar Chief US equity strategist David Sekera.David, you're certainly in the minority among some of the analysts that we've spoken to who said there's still more upside with Nvidia. I'm curious to get your take on where Nvidia trades at right now because there is the argument, and I'm sure you've heard it, that things are a little cheaper, actually, when you think about the outlook for Nvidia and the upside that we see.DAVE SEKERA: So right now, we rate Nvidia with two stars. Which means that we think it's overvalued. It's currently at about a 30% premium above our $300 fair value estimate. And, again, we have a very positive outlook on the company. It's just a matter of we think that the valuation has just gotten ahead of itself at this point in time.And when I look at our projections, you know, I don't think that we're necessarily being especially conservative. We are looking for a 50% increase in the top line this year. And in fact, when I look over the course of the next five years, we're projecting revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23%. So essentially taking it from $27 billion in revenue in 2023 to $76 billion in 2028.At the same point in time, we're also bringing our operating margins up. Essentially doubling them to about 50%. Over the past five years, they've averaged 28.7. So, essentially, we're taking our EPS growth rate from $3.34 in 2023 all the way up to $16.29. Essentially people are paying 23.6 times 2028 earnings right now. So, again, while we're very positive on the underlying fundamentals, I think it's just the valuation has just gotten ahead of itself.Story continues- David, do you also think that, more broadly, when it comes to so many of these names that are associated with AI, this AI-fueled rally. Is that overdone across the board, or is this more specific to Nvidia's massive run-up that we've seen?DAVE SEKERA: Well, in this case, I do think it is very specific to Nvidia. We do still see some other opportunities out there for investors. Taiwan Semi would be one that I would highlight that I think is good for people to take a look at. We do still think that there is additional upside there.But I do think that we're going to see a lot more competition in the space. They're just generating too much revenue growth, too high a margins. Granted, they do have first mover margin-- first mover advantage right now. But with those kind of margins, it's just going to be attracting more and more competition over the next couple of years.And competition, not just from the other chipmakers but also from some of the users. So Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, they're all moving into this space. They're trying to design their own chips as well.- Let's talk about another sector that you're watching that you may not like as much. And we're talking about the energy sector. Obviously, the biggest winner last year. Certainly hasn't performed to the level that we saw in 2022. Hes is one that you've highlighted. Why?DAVE SEKERA: Well, it's almost a similar story. In that, we're very positive on the underlying company and the fundamentals, but we do think that the valuation has just gotten ahead of itself. So we rate this company or the stock with just one star. It trades at a 60% premium over our $84 fair value estimates. Company does have some of the best assets in the space, great growth prospects, x but the valuation has just gotten ahead of itself too much.So I talked to our energy analyst on some of the metrics he was looking at. Enterprise value to EBITDA. The stock's trading above 9 times right now. The next closest competitor is about six times. So our fair value estimate would actually still put a higher valuation on the company at 7 times but certainly lower than where it's in the marketplace today.And I'd also note too that we do think oil prices will remain relatively high over the next year or two. We're looking for oil at $72 a barrel on average this year, dropping down to $66 a barrel next year. But when we look at our long-term supply and demand forecast in conjunction with the cost of production, we do think, over time, that oil prices will continue to keep coming down. Our long-term target on oil is $55 a barrel.- David, let's move on to some of the names that you do like. One of those AT&amp;T. It's actually been off just about 13% since the start of January. Telecoms haven't exactly been in favor here amongst investors. What do you see as the catalyst for AT&amp;T?DAVE SEKERA: Well, what I like about AT&amp;T right now is I think that stock is at the intersection of being a deep value play. And with as much as growth as run-up thus far this year, I still think that the value in the market now is going to be in the value space and communications.And, again, the communications sector is the most undervalued sector in our view at a 20% discount to fair value. So when I look at AT&amp;T, it's currently rated five stars, which is our highest rating. Trades at a 36% discount to our $25 fair value. And our fair value estimate when I look at some of the metrics that's eight times enterprise value to EBITDA, 7% free cash flow yield. So again, not very stretched multiples in my mind.I look at the stock it's paying at 7% or about a 7% dividend yield. And we do think, fundamentally, the company is in a relatively strong position. We rate the company with a narrow economic moat. Which means that we do think they have long-term structural cost advantages.- What does that moat look like? I mean, when you highlight in your notes that there's only three players, really, when you talk about the wireless space right now. What makes AT&amp;Ts moat particularly strong?DAVE SEKERA: Well, there's a couple of things going on here. So one, we do have the merger now between T-Mobile and Sprint with only three major players in the market. We do expect that going forward pricing in the cell phone business and the wireless business should be much more rational going forward.But some of the other things I like here is that in 2020 they did bring a new CE on. And he's been taking a lot of corporate actions really to unlock shareholder value. So he's been doing a number of things strategically to reposition the business, make sure that they're going to be able to address the ongoing evolution within the telecom sector.But then he's also been refocusing the company strategy. We thought it was a good move to spin off, you know WarnerMedia. He also sold a stake in DirecTV. So we do think that as he's refocusing on that core business, stepping up investments in both the wireless and the fixed line networks, that CapEx spending will pay off for shareholders over time.- David, do you also see some opportunity in a regional bank named US Bancorp? And this comes at a time when many investors are a little bit nervous to touch this sector. Why do you think US Bancorp is better protected amongst some of those risks out there for regionals?DAVE SEKERA: Yeah, I mean, overall, it looks like the regional banks have been in kind of that bottoming-out stage. And this is probably our best pick in the regional area. So it's also rated five stars. Trades at a 38% discount to our $53 fair value.We do believe that they do have a wide economic moat. And we also believe that the uncertainty there would be more of a medium rating. And again also pays a 7% dividend yield. So when we think about the regional banking business model overall, yes, it's definitely under stress here in the near term, but it's not broken.And one of the things about US Bank is that they are larger than the typical regional bank. And I suspect that they're going to see less deposit flight. And in fact, if you look at the first quarter earnings, I think they only saw 4% of deposits leave. And I think that over time, they're just going to have some of the better earnings leverage out there.So when I look at our model. We're looking at for the long term. You have 15% returns on tangible common equity, well above 9% cost of capital. And that puts it in the higher end of our regional bank coverage.- Morningstar chief US market strategist David Sekera. It's good to have you on today. Appreciate the time.]"

WMT, W.W. Grainger Inc. GWW, Novartis NVS and Graphic Packaging Holding Company GPK.5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy for OutperformanceWall Street has been on a stellar ride in recent weeks, with the S&amp;P 500 on the verge of entering the bull market fueled by the big technology surge and hopes over the Fed’s rate hike pause. However, hedge funds and other speculative investors have built up their most bearish position since 2007 at the same time, making investors’ jittery.Amid such a scenario, nothing is better than dividend investing. This is especially true as dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation. In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Toll Brothers, Walmart Inc., W.W. Grainger Inc., Novartis and Graphic Packaging Holding Company— that could be compelling picks for outperformance.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Story continuesAlthough these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Pennsylvania-based Toll Brothers builds single-family detached and attached home communities, master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities, and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities, principally on the land it develops and improves.

15,15628db0-b6f8-3555-aff6-6d2bffe68491,HBAN,2023-06-10,Here's What We Like About Huntington Bancshares' (NASDAQ:HBAN) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-huntington-bancshares-nasdaq-hban-120403854.html,1686398643,STORY,['HBAN'],"[Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase Huntington Bancshares' shares on or after the 15th of June, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 3rd of July.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.62 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Huntington Bancshares has a trailing yield of 5.7% on the current stock price of $10.95. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Huntington Bancshares's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Huntington Bancshares has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Huntington Bancshares paid out a comfortable 39% of its profit last year.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Huntington Bancshares earnings per share are up 8.9% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Huntington Bancshares has delivered an average of 15% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Huntington Bancshares? Huntington Bancshares has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. Huntington Bancshares ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.So while Huntington Bancshares looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for Huntington Bancshares (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

We will now work closely with government and lenders to understand the detail of the measure and its effectiveness at unlocking investment,” he said.This follows the Treasury unveiling the Energy Security Investment Mechanism (ESIM) earlier today, which establishes a price floor at $71.40 per barrel and 54p per therm.At this point, the Energy Profits Levy – known as the windfall tax – would fall away entirely, with taxes on earnings dropping from 75 to 40 per cent.However, oil prices would need to fall below the price floor for a period of six months for the windfall tax to be removed.Based on forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibly, ESIM will not be triggered before the tax’s planned end date in March 2028.City A.M. first revealed the industry was pushing for a price floor earlier this year, which was being considered by the Treasury ahead of ‘Green Day’ – the government response to the US Inflation Reduction Act which turned out to be highly underwhelming.ESIM is designed to bolster certainty in the oil and gas sector to raise capital, following fossil fuel producers including Total, Enquest and Harbour Energy withdrawing from key projects this year.Story continuesMeanwhile, Rosebank – the largest undeveloped oil and gas field in the North Sea – faces an uncertain future with minority stakeholder Ithaca Energy weighing up whether to invest in the project.It has been locked in talks with the government over the project for months, as exclusively covered by City A.M.North Sea oil and gas exploration is featured in the government’s energy security strategy – as it looks to reduce its reliance overseas supplies.However, today’s announcement has been panned within the industry, with criticisms aimed at the price floor’s low oil price and forecast lack of usage.This meant they feared it would fail to encourage more investment in the North Sea.An industry source told City A.M. that the ESIM “doesn’t do anything” to change investment conditions and will not encourage banks – which have toughened lending rules – to provide more capital to oil and gas companies.They dismissed the floor threshold as below conventional conditions – with six month periods of oil prices that low typically representing only severe economic conditions.By CityAMMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Canadian Wildfires Trigger Unprecedented Solar Energy DeclineHigh Vehicle Costs Dampen Steel Market MomentumRussia And Iran Boost International Trade With North-South Transport CorridorRead this article on OilPrice.com]"
21,68c5b006-6966-38b6-a051-73af2c4820c7,O,2023-06-10,GLOBAL MARKETS-World shares at 13-month peak as Wall St scales 2023 highs,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-world-shares-13-204615467.html,1686343575,STORY,"['CL=F', '^GSPC']","[(Updates prices)By Naomi Rovnick and Koh Gui QingNEW YORK/LONDON June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. shares struck new highs for the year on Friday and helped lift world stocks to a 13-month peak, as rising bets that the Federal Reserve will skip a rate hike next week overshadowed worries about U.S. markets being drained of cash.Helped by a surge in Tesla Inc, which jumped as much as 5.7%, the S&amp;P 500 rose to levels last seen in August before paring gains. It finished higher 0.1%, the best close since Aug. 16. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.13%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.16%.Over in Europe, the STOXX 600 index lost 0.13%, but MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 0.74% overnight. Combined with gains on Wall Street, the MSCI's broadest index of world stocks added 0.18% at a 13-month high. For the week, the index for world stocks might notch a 0.6% rise.""As of today, the S&amp;P 500 is back in a bull market,"" said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Briley Wealth, noting that the index finished Thursday with a 20% gain off its recent lows. ""The one thing that could tip over the apple cart is an over-aggressive Fed.""Refinitiv data showed the S&amp;P 500 up 20% from its Oct. 12 closing low. The most commonly accepted definition of a bull market is a 20% rise off a low, and a 20% decline from a high for a bear market, but that is open to interpretation.Traders now lay 73% odds on the Fed keeping rates steady on June 14, in a range of 5%-5.25%, pausing its most aggressive hiking cycle since the 1980s.Bets for a pause were supported by data on Thursday that showed the number of Americans filing new jobless claims surged to a more than 1 1/2-year high, indicating a loosening labour market that could further quell inflation.Investors also hope the Fed will pause its rate rise campaign as a quirk of the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations has posed a potential threat to market liquidity.Story continuesThe U.S. government is expected to rush to sell short-term debt to replenish its Treasury General Account (TGA), potentially at yields so high that banks raise deposit rates to compete for funding, reducing interest in riskier assets like equities.""We're all worried about liquidity,"" said Ben Jones, director of macro research at Invesco. The Fed, he added, ""still wants to tighten"" policy and therefore may allow the TGA rebuild to drain liquidity from markets without stepping in to provide other support tools.This fear was not dominating trading on Friday, however.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on May 19 it was still unclear whether U.S. interest rates will need to rise further, and the risks of overtightening or undertightening had become more balanced.YIELDS UPUncertainty about the U.S. rates outlook supported Treasury yields.Two-year Treasury yields, which are extremely sensitive to monetary policy expectations, rose to 4.602%, while the yield on benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR climbed to 3.743%.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the performance of the U.S. currency against six others, rebounded 0.21% to 103.47.The euro slipped 0.32% to $1.0748, just below Thursday's two-week high of $1.0787.Elsewhere, the Turkish lira hit a new record low overnight of 23.54 per dollar, even as President Tayyip Erdogan's appointment of a U.S. banker as central bank chief sent a strong signal for a return to more orthodox policy.Erdogan last week put well-regarded former finance minister Mehmet Simsek back in the post. Simsek said this week that the guiding principles for the economy would be transparency, consistency, accountability and predictability.Leading crypto asset bitcoin dipped 0.2% to $26,450 after crypto exchange Binance said it was suspending dollar deposits and would soon pause fiat currency withdrawal channels following a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission crackdown.Crude oil edged higher but gains were tempered by a report that the United States and Iran were close to a nuclear deal, although denials from both parties kept it off the previous session's lows.The prospect of a deal, which reportedly included scope for an additional 1 million barrels per day of Iranian supply, initially dented crude prices.Brent crude futures whipsawed over the course on Friday, and ended down 1.3% at $74.98 a barrel.

Excluding dividends, only 9 out of 187 REITs have been profitable over that time frame. Just as things were beginning to improve post-pandemic, REITs were confronted with the worst inflation in decades and multiple Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to combat that inflation.While it seems that the Fed may be nearing the end of its long series of interest rate hikes, new recessionary fears have taken hold on Wall Street. While a few sub-sectors such as hotel, diversified and residential REITs have begun to show strength, others such as office and retail REITs have been especially hit hard by these fears.This week the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange, is holding an investor conference at the New York Hilton Midtown Manhattan in New York City. Over 1,000 real estate and other companies are expected to attend. The conference gives investors the opportunity to meet with management teams from dozens of REITs and get answers to questions concerning the present environment as well as future projections.Some REITs, such as First Industrial Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE: FR) and Caretrust REIT Inc. (NYSE: CTRE), updated investor presentations on company websites ahead of the conference. Several REITs have already given presentations in which CEOs have sought to reassure investors that financials are on the upswing in their companies.Take a look at a few of the REITs that have given presentations:Don't miss: The Company That Built Elon Musk's Tiny Home Is Partnering With This REIT To Solve The Affordable Housing Crisis And Provide A Unique Investment OpportunityRealty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) is a San Diego-based, triple-net lease retail REIT with over 12,400 properties around the world. The “Monthly Dividend Company,” as it is widely known, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 and an S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, with 635 consecutive monthly dividends paid and 120 dividend increases since 1994. It is one of the most widely held REITs among investors today because of its stability and growth. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994, Realty Income has had a 14.6% compound annual total return.Story continuesOn June 6, CEO Sumit Roy told investors at the NAREIT conference that Realty Income’s portfolio consists mostly of recession-resilient convenience and grocery stores. Addressing the potential for an economic slowdown, Roy said, “People still need to check out groceries.”Sumit Roy also noted that between 2018 and 2022, Realty Income’s adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) grew 5% annually despite the COVID-19 pandemic and higher borrowing costs. He further reassured investors that Realty Income is investing in real estate that still has attractive cap rates and that occupancy in its portfolio as of March 31 was 99%.Year to date, Realty Income’s total return is negative 3.95%.Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) is a Richmond, Virginia-based hotel REIT, formed in 2007. Its owns 28,984 rooms in 220 hotels in 87 markets across 37 states. Its portfolio includes 96 Marriotts, 119 Hiltons, four Hyatts and one independent hotel.On June 6, CEO Justin Knight spoke with investors at the NAREIT conference about Apple Hospitality REIT’s rebound in occupancy from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, an improving balance sheet and how artificial intelligence (AI) may impact the hotel industry by making it more efficient.Knight cited Apple Hospitality REIT’s low debt and leverage as company attributes during rising interest rate periods and reassured investors that “continued strength in leisure demand and increased business travel” has positively impacted Apple Hospitality’s earnings in the first quarter. He added that Apple Hospitality has plenty of funds to continue to underwrite properties in the future.In recent months, there have been several positive developments for Apple Hospitality. First-quarter FFO of $0.34 beat estimates by a penny and was 21.6% better than FFO of $0.28 in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $311.45 million beat the estimates by $16.72 million and was 19.6% above the revenue from the first quarter of 2022.There have also been insider purchases by two company executives within the last month. Year to date, Apple Hospitality REIT’s total return is 1.61%.Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE: CCI) is a Houston-based specialized REIT that focuses on owning, operating and long-term leasing of cell towers. Crown Castle works with businesses and governments to design and build solutions that meet connectivity needs like wireless coverage and custom fiber optic networks. It has a market cap of $55.97 billion, making it one of the largest REITs in the U.S.Crown Castle was founded in 1994 with a portfolio of 133 cell towers. Less than 30 years later, Crown Castle has over 40,000 towers and 85,000 miles of fiber and 120,000 “small cells” (base stations like 5G that are used to enhance cellular network coverage and capacity) in its portfolio. Most of its towers — 75% — are in the 100 largest areas of the U.S.On June 6, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Schlanger spoke with investors at the NAREIT conference. Schlanger told the audience that Crown Castle has two goals — the first is to grow its dividends per share by around 7% to 8% per year by offering its wireless carrier customers the lowest-cost solution to building out a network.Crown Castle’s second goal is to grow its revenue on the 40,000 cell tower assets it already owns. Cell tower leasing makes up about 70% of Crown Castle’s revenue.Schlanger wrapped up the presentation by saying that Crown Castle has a tremendous opportunity in the small cell building area of the business, which he sees growing exponentially over the next decade. Year to date, Crown Castle has a total return of negative 17.18%, so it has not performed well in the present economic environment.One thing is for sure — executives will always paint the rosiest picture possible of their companies. Whether these presentations succeed in assuaging investor concerns over the economy and company earnings remains to be seen.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned +4.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has gained 5.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.2%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $13.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $55.03 billion and $57.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.5% and +5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $14.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.70 for the same period compares with $2.06 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.35%. The EPS surprise was +1.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This proactive annual probe ensures that FE’s transmission lines can operate efficiently during the summer and transfer high-voltage power from generation units to the designated locations.  The company used helicopters for quick and efficient execution of the job. The helicopter patrols conducted inspections of nearly 18,000 miles of high-voltage power lines, with personnel examining the wires, equipment and structures for potential maintenance issues.FirstEnergy uses thermovision cameras to take infrared pictures of electrical equipment, assisting in the identification of possible issues in power lines and substations. It also trimmed trees along transmission lines in order to safeguard them against disruptions caused by trees during severe weather events.Need for Investments &amp; MaintenanceThe company’s strategic investment will help it serve its 6 million customers more efficiently. In the past several years, Regulated Distribution has experienced rate base growth through investments. FirstEnergy’s ‘Energizing the Future’ plan is aimed at enhancing and expanding its regulated transmission capabilities. Through 2022, the company invested more than $10 billion in the plan. The idea was to modernize and improve the reliability and resiliency of its transmission system.FE expects to invest nearly $11.4 billion in the 2023-2025 period to further strengthen its existing operations. The company projects an investment of $5.9 billion and $5.4 billion in regulated distribution and regulated transmission, respectively, during the same period. Strengthening of the transmission lines will allow FirstEnergy to transmit electricity even during adverse weather conditions.A rise in temperature not only increases the demand for electricity but also poses a threat to electric infrastructure. These inspections and maintenance tasks are crucial to maintaining service reliability and ensuring customer satisfaction.Story continuesUtilities’ Focus on InfrastructureIn order to provide reliable service to customers, utilities make systematic investment to upgrade transmission and distribution lines and develop new substations. The objective is to warrant proper supply of electricity to millions of customers across the United States.Along with FirstEnergy, other electric power companies like Xcel Energy, Inc. XEL, Exelon Corporation EXC and Duke Energy DUK are adopting measures to strengthen their existing infrastructure.Xcel Energy aims to spend $29.5 billion during 2023-2027, out of which the company plans to invest nearly $18 billion in strengthening its electric distribution and transmission operations.XEL’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) implies a year-over-year improvement of 6%.Exelon invests substantially in infrastructure projects. It plans to spend nearly $31.3 billion during 2023-2026 on regulated utility operations for grid modernization and enhancement of its infrastructure’s resilience.EXC’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.68%.

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Flowserve (FLS), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Flowserve currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if FLS is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this company that makes pumps, valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor FLS, shares are up 4.92% over the past week while the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry is up 2.36% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.52% compares favorably with the industry's 4.36% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Flowserve have risen 17.73%, and are up 16.45% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 7.94% and 5.97%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to FLS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. FLS is currently averaging 845,959 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with FLS.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost FLS's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.67 to $1.81 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that FLS is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Flowserve on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That’s according to a survey conducted last summer by workforce development nonprofits American Student Assistance and Jobs for the Future.“Skills-based hiring is the great white whale, the holy grail of the labor market,” said Joseph Fuller, management professor at Harvard Business School.Since emerging from the dot-com bust, LinkedIn has already helped move the needle on what's acceptable behavior in the job market. It's no longer considered disloyal, for instance, for an employee to create a profile allowing recruiters to scout — and hire — talented people not actively looking for another job.“Twenty years ago, either you were actively looking for work or you were not looking for work,” said Dan Shapero, LinkedIn’s chief operating officer.The site, which turned 20 in May, has amassed more than 930 million members worldwide, becoming a place where CEOs and workers alike celebrate milestones, air grievances and build networks — altering how some people and companies search for jobs and job candidates. Last year, the platform accounted for roughly 6% of parent Microsoft Corp.’s almost $200 billion in revenue, a small but growing part of sales.Story continuesLinkedIn launched a skills-matching feature in February, allowing users to see how the skills a job calls for might align with their own strengths. There are some positive early signs: More than 45% of recruiters on LinkedIn now search for candidates using skills data, according to the company. Meanwhile, LinkedIn is building artificial intelligence into the platform, with the goal of making the match between job seekers and employers more efficient.Skills-first hiring as an ideal has a long history. It’s considered a way to expand economic opportunity, especially for those without college degrees. But so far there hasn’t been much large-scale progress in that direction.“Skills has been a conversation that has been going on for years, for decades,” said Aneesh Raman, a LinkedIn vice president. “In those conversations were often the same people: policymakers, academics, nonprofits. Missing from those conversations, almost all of them, were employers.”The exceedingly tight job market of the past two years, however, has forced companies to widen their search. Employers have now finally entered the room, he said. When it comes to skills-based hiring, Raman said, “Employers are no longer asking: ‘What is this?’ They're asking, ‘How do I do this?’”LinkedIn hopes to provide the answer, but it won't be easy.For starters, it’s one thing to say that you have a particular skill, and another to prove it. “Outside of certain industries, like construction and the trades, we don’t have licenses that provide a representation of an acquired skill that employers can count on,” said Harvard’s Fuller, who penned a piece titled “Skills-Based Hiring Is on the Rise” in the Harvard Business Review last year. There’s also no shared language or standard classification system for skills and that risks mismatches between the ways different skills are described in job posts and resumes.While technical skills like coding are relatively easy to test for, “soft skills,” like communication or teamwork, can be especially difficult to validate. For instance, you say you’re a good listener, but are you, really? That’s one reason employers have leaned heavily on college degrees as a proxy, albeit an imperfect one, for all sorts of social competencies. Some progress has been made, Fuller said, by using structured interviewing and behavioral psychology assessments, but companies’ capacity on this front is still limited.The wild card for LinkedIn may be its ability to tap into Microsoft's AI progress. That might help the site surface often-overlooked candidates, like those who lack a four-year degree or have a criminal conviction, and successfully match them with employers, Fuller said. “Perhaps the deus ex machina here is AI.”--With assistance from Dina Bass.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMicrosoft’s Sudden AI Dominance Is Scrambling Silicon Valley’s Power StructureIs AT&amp;T’s RTO Mandate a Mass Layoff in Disguise?A Saudi Airline Embraces Luxury to End Emirates and Qatar’s Gulf DominanceLayoffs and AI Are Changing Tech’s Once-Invincible Job MarketHow Nvidia Became ChatGPT’s Brain and Joined the $1 Trillion Club©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The event will facilitate discussions among participating countries, fostering collaboration to establish a unified approach to mitigate AI-related risks and ensuring shared responsibility in this domain.Giants like Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, Meta Platforms META and Amazon.com AMZN have invested a lot in AI in recent years.Google has dedicated several years to develop a large language model-based generative AI, which is similar to the technology-driven ChatGPT.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microsoft (MSFT).Microsoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 32 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 32 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 26 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 81.3% and 6.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MSFTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MSFTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Microsoft here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Microsoft, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in MSFT?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Microsoft, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $9.66.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Microsoft.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Attorneys representing the state say that, in all, New Mexico’s opioid litigation has brought in more than $1 billion.They argued at trial last year that Walgreens failed to recognize suspicious prescriptions and refuse to fill them.“I’m optimistic this will help in the fight against the opioid crisis and provide the treatment New Mexicans so desperately need,” Luis Robles, one of the attorneys who worked on the case, told the Santa Fe New Mexican.Over the past few years, drug manufacturers, distribution companies, pharmacies and other companies with roles in the opioid business have reached settlements totaling more than $50 billion with local, state and tribal governments.In May, West Virginia announced its settlement with Kroger, bringing that state's total opioid litigation dollars to more than $1 billion. West Virginia state has lost more lives to opioid overdoses per capita than any other.Most of the settlement money from the opioid litigation is required to be used to fight the crisis, which has been linked to more than 560,000 deaths in the U.S. over the past two decades, including more than 70,000 a year recently.In recent years, most of the deaths have been connected to fentanyl and other illicit synthetic opioids, not prescription painkillers, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.]"

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Monster Beverage Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.56bUS$1.95bUS$2.10bUS$2.29bUS$2.55bUS$2.72bUS$2.87bUS$2.99bUS$3.11bUS$3.21bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.84%Est @ 5.42%Est @ 4.43%Est @ 3.73%Est @ 3.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$1.5kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$69bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$69b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$35bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$53b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$57.3, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Monster Beverage as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Monster BeverageStrengthCurrently debt free.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

STZ has been witnessing momentum, owing to strength in its beer portfolio, with the continued robust performance of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra, and newer brands, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada. Moreover, the company’s premiumization strategy is playing out well, evident from accelerated growth of the Power Brands.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year's sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.1% and 9.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported number.The stock has risen 2.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s and the Consumer Staple sector’s growth of 1.6% and 0.7%, respectively. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Growth DriversConstellation Brands is on track with its premiumization strategy. In the wine &amp; spirits segment, the company’s premium brands have been witnessing accelerated growth over the past few quarters. Its high-end Power Brands, including The Prisoner Brand Family, Kim Crawford and Meiomi, were key growth drivers in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.Depletions for the wine and spirits segment were partly aided by a high-single-digit rise in The Prisoner Brand Family, low-double-digit gains for High West Whiskey and mid-single-digit growth in the Ignite portfolio. The company’s Aspira portfolio yielded double-digit shipment growth.Within the beer segment, gains from the premiumization efforts are evident from the growth in traditional beer, as well as the flavors category, including seltzers, flavored beer, RTD spirits and flavored malt beverages. The company is making investments to fuel the growth of its power brands through innovation, capitalizing on priority and consumer trends, with successful product introductions.As a part of its efforts, Constellation Brands is also on track with its plans to invest in the next phase of capacity expansion in Mexico. This will help meet the potential demand for the high-end Mexican beer portfolio, including the emerging Alternative Beverage Alcohol sub-space, which includes hard seltzers. The expansion will support an addition of up to 30 million hectoliters of modular capacity and includes the construction of a brewery in Southeast Mexico’s Veracruz. It also targets continued expansion and the optimization of the existing Nava and Obregon breweries.Constellation Brands has been significantly gaining from strength in the beer business over the years. Despite a decline in sales in the fourth quarter, the company witnessed a strong depletion volume on solid beer business trends. The beer segment reported depletion growth of 6.3%, benefiting from the continued robust performance of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra, and newer brands, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada. Depletion volume increased 9% for Modelo Especial and about 45% for Modelo Chelada. Additionally, depletion for Corona Extra improved 4%.For fiscal 2024, Net sales are likely to increase 7-9% for the beer segment, with the operating income rising 5-7%.Story continuesHeadwinds to AddressConstellation Brands has been witnessing softness in its wine &amp; spirits business for a while now. Sales for the wine and spirits segment decreased 14% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. Shipment volume in the wine and spirits business declined 22.1% year over year, whereas depletions dropped 4.9%. Organic sales for the segment declined 9%, including an 18.9% dip in organic shipments. For fiscal 2024, the company expects organic net sales for the wine and spirits business between down 0.5% and up 0.5%.Moreover, it has been witnessing weak margins stemming from inflation, higher operating costs from brewery expansions and elevated marketing expenses. Higher COGS, driven by elevated raw material, packaging and logistics costs, hurt the beer business’ operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter. Persistent inflationary pressures and higher SG&amp;A expenses have also been weighing on results, despite improved pricing.Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely, Molson Coors TAP, Monster Beverage MNST and PepsiCo Inc.

This makes the dividend yield 8.0%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Western Union Western Union's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The last payment was quite easily covered by earnings, but it made up 124% of cash flows. This signals that the company is more focused on returning cash flow to shareholders, but it could mean that the dividend is exposed to cuts in the future.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 12.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 56%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendWestern Union Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.40, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.94. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Western Union has impressed us by growing EPS at 22% per year over the past five years. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.Our Thoughts On Western Union's DividendOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. While Western Union is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We don't think Western Union is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, Western Union has 4 warning signs (and 2 which are potentially serious) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the real estate market outlook and skip to the top commercial real estate stocks, check out 5 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy. There is still significant uncertainty regarding the future usage of office buildings as companies and employees adapt to hybrid working models even after three years since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the world. According to PwC, while companies and their employees are determining their preferred work arrangements, some firms are choosing to retain their office spaces as a precautionary measure or due to lease obligations. However, an increasing number of companies are downsizing or opting not to renew expiring leases. Consequently, vacancy rates in the office sector continue to rise gradually, which is in contrast to other major property sectors. Additionally, many tenants are resorting to subletting their office spaces until their leases expire. On the other hand, occupancy levels for logistics real estate in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are currently at or near all-time highs. There are also positive indications suggesting that the retail sector is experiencing a revival. Investment managers interviewed by PwC highlighted the robust operational performance of their retail portfolios in the United States and Europe. This upward trend extends beyond the more resilient sub-sectors such as convenience stores, grocery stores, and retail parks. Selected shopping centers are demonstrating strong performance in the market as well. Don't Miss: 20 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USAThe commercial real estate sector continues to face significant economic uncertainty for the remainder of 2023, with several key factors impacting its future. These factors include the uncertain interest rate environment and the evolving nature of office spaces. Over the period from March 2022 to May 2023, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates consistently for ten consecutive times. However, according to JPMorgan, multifamily properties continue to thrive. While the rate of rent increases has declined, the national vacancy rate for multifamily properties was 4.5% at the end of 2022. Vacancy rates vary across different metro areas, but the median vacancy rate in the country as of April stands at 3.9%. Story continuesFurthermore, JPMorgan noted that despite e-commerce comprising around 15% of retail, not all consumer needs can be met online. Certain services, like nail salons, barbershops, and sports bars, still require in-person visits. The industrial sector has experienced significant growth driven by e-commerce and the on-demand economy as well. The vacancy rate for distribution and warehouse spaces hit a record low of 4.1% in the second half of 2022, but it increased slightly to 4.2% in the first quarter of 2023. While demand for office space has been impacted by remote and hybrid work models, A-class office properties continue to perform well, especially those with leases lasting 10 years or more, which may be able to weather market corrections. On the other hand, B- and C-class office buildings, particularly those with shorter leases in non-prime locations, face challenges as the workplace evolves. The real estate industry is undergoing significant changes driven by technology advancements and increased capital. FortuneBuilders observed that online property listing platforms, smartphone apps, virtual reality, and blockchain technology are expected to have a profound impact on real estate transactions. Buyers and renters now have access to online platforms, leading to more informed property searches. Moreover, blockchain technology is likely to be utilized for legal components of transactions, such as transferring deeds and sharing important documents, increasing trust and reducing intermediaries. Virtual reality will also gain popularity, allowing potential buyers to virtually tour properties without physically visiting them. Meanwhile, millennials are entering the real estate market with a preference for suburban areas and walkable neighborhoods, presenting new opportunities for investors in mixed-use and retail spaces. Overall, the future of real estate will be shaped by technological advancements and shifting buyer preferences.In this exciting real estate landscape, some of the best commercial stocks to invest in include CBRE Group, Inc.

However, as the largest public office REIT, it operates in a challenging space due to high capital expenditure needs, the ease of adding new supply and tenant leverage. BXP is also concentrated in large coastal markets that have high taxes and burdensome regulations, and subsequently have seen population outflows. We believe the combination of a tough business and a marginally worse environment given the rising acceptance of at-home work will be challenging over the long term for BXP.”7.

(NYSE:RHP) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Ryman Hospitality is a well-run, resiliently positioned REIT that has carved out a core competency in the group-travel business. The company owns 5 of the 10 largest convention-oriented resorts under the Gaylord Hotel brand, and it has a small entertainment business which owns iconic assets like the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger's Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, Schlumberger has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Outstandingly, Schlumberger's EPS shot from US$1.49 to US$2.71, over the last year. Year on year growth of 82% is certainly a sight to behold. That could be a sign that the business has reached a true inflection point.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of Schlumberger shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 13% to 15% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Schlumberger?Story continuesAre Schlumberger Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Schlumberger has a market capitalisation of US$68b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$156m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Schlumberger but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is Schlumberger Worth Keeping An Eye On?Schlumberger's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, Schlumberger is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Schlumberger , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Although Schlumberger certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

66,8eb6ee58-f581-3332-b457-f4a83bd5cb14,AIG,2023-06-10,4 Stocks With Low Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio to Buy Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-low-price-cash-124400583.html,1686314640,STORY,"['UNM', 'GM', 'AIG', 'GIII']","[Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential.Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM, American International Group, Inc. AIG and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true-value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 8.4% for three-five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.6%, on average.

This technology increases the typical depths of plasma proteomics analysis by 50% to more than 100% when compared to neat plasma or serum proteomics without depletion or enrichment.More on ENRICH-iST KitsPlasma or serum from a variety of species, such as humans, rodents, NHPs, dogs, and pigs, can be processed into proteomic samples using the ENRICH-iST technology in a straightforward, quick (around 5 hours total) and affordable manner.It routinely produces reproducible, improved findings for LC-MS analysis, such as by DIA-PASEF timsTOF 4D Proteomics mass spectrometry, using only 20 microL of starting material. The technology supports liquid handling automation platforms like Tecan FLUENT systems and enables biologically-unbiased enrichment of less abundant proteins using non-functionalized paramagnetic microbeads.Up to 96 plasma samples can be processed quickly and effectively in parallel using the innovative ENRICH-iST methodology for repeatable large-cohort translational and clinical research and validation. The accessible ENRICH-iST routine enrichment approach nicely complements the already used automated bead depletion or nanoparticle array enrichment workflows for ultra-deep plasma proteomics discovery research.Significance of ENRICH-iST KitsThe company frequently uses biofluid cohorts obtained from preclinical animals in its study. With the new technology, the company will be able to obtain trustworthy and thorough proteome data without the need for time-consuming method development. The new kit is ready to use right out of the box and the workflow is simple to understand and fully automatable.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company can now have a quick, effective and dependable enrichment procedure to delve deeper into the proteome from human plasma and serum thanks to the innovative ENRICH technology. By automating PretOmics’ new ERICH-iST kit on Bruker’s Fluent workstation, the company is enabling robust and reproducible high-throughput sample preparation for large cohort studies, accelerating progress in this rapidly-advancing field.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsGoing by a Market Research Future report, the global proteomics market size was $23.2 billion in 2017.

69,ee0a9360-c8cd-39d5-9cec-8c91e3aedfce,HOLX,2023-06-10,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why Hologic, Inc. (HOLX) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-hologic-inc-130012977.html,1686315612,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this medical device maker have returned -4.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has lost 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.89 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -35.4%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.09 indicates a change of +5.1% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $956.48 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.6%. The $4.01 billion and $4.15 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -17.6% and +3.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.5%. EPS of $1.06 for the same period compares with $2.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $967.05 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.15%. The EPS surprise was +20.45%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Netflix's stock rose after data from Antenna showed a jump in subscribers as the company's password sharing crackdown kicked off in the U.S. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the trending tickers of the day.Video Transcript- Let's take a look at some of those individual movers. First up, Tesla shares edging higher, locking in its 11th straight day of gains. Now, this ties its longest win streak ever, which took place back in January of 2021. The rally in Tesla coming from a pileup of good news here. The latest headline being its EV charging partnership with GM. Akiko, adding to the momentum that we saw last week following the announcement with Ford, seems like it's good news here for Tesla.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, there's the expectation now that they've got this partnership with GM, in addition to Ford, that this NACS, which is the charging port that Tesla uses, that could become the new standard here in North America at least. What's interesting to me as we've been saying, is just how the other EV charging companies have been getting hit, have gotten hit on the back of this. But it certainly feels like it's a big one all around, not just for Tesla but for adoption of EVs.All right. Netflix posting gains on a report the streaming giant saw US signups rise by the most in at least four and 1/2 years. This boost in user acquisition coming in days after Netflix has cracked down on password sharing last month. The data, of course, coming from analytics platform Antenna. It is a good sign, of course, at a time when people or investors were concerned about how, how much churn we'd likely see as a result of the password crackdown.- Yeah. And the big question, you brought this up earlier, is whether or not the type of gains that we have seen maybe not to the degree, but how much of that momentum is going to continue. Obviously, when we saw the crackdown here in the US of the password sharing, many of those users who were affected did sign up right away for new accounts. The question going forward is just how much runway Netflix has.But shares hitting the highest level that we have seen since February of 2022. The street very positive though on this move from Netflix. Pivotal was out with a new note today, just calling this a unique tech growth story here. And I think that's what a lot of people are just trying to figure out. When we look at the two-year chart of shares still under pressure, off just over 13%, what that subscriber growth looks like here going forward given the fact that there is some saturation here in the US.]"

Yahoo Finance entertainment reporter Allie Canal joins the Live show to discuss how investor sentiment and Netflix's new ad-tier service are impacting the stock.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Netflix shares seeing a boost today after new data shows that its crackdown on password sharing seems to be paying off. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is here with the details on that. Allie, how big of a win is it here for Netflix?ALLIE CANAL: I think it's a really big win. And there's continued positive data that we've been getting on the ad-supported tier. And now we have new data about the crackdown on password sharing. Antenna is an analytics platform, and they said that US signups for Netflix jumped by the most in at least 4 and 1/2 years following the rollout of that password sharing crackdown in the US and over 100 other countries and territories on May 23rd. According to the data, Netflix saw nearly 100,000 daily sign-ups on both May 26th and May 27th, so just a few days after that US implementation.Now, I'm sure, with that, has come some churn, but I know anecdotally, I've become so used to freeloading on my parents' Netflix account that I can't imagine a world where I don't have Netflix. So I'll be one of those users signing up for my own account. I know there's others that say they won't, but I do think the numbers and the data we get surrounding this, it's going to be very interesting, especially in the next few weeks and the next few quarters.JPMorgan estimating that roughly 100 million users are currently sharing passwords. That's something that Netflix has said as well. But out of those users, the company will monetize 14 million by the end of 2023, 26 million by the end of 2024, and 33 million by the end of 2025. And as you can see, that's leading to a lot of bullish sentiment on Wall Street. JPM boosted its price target on the stock earlier this week, along with Wells Fargo.Story continuesWe also got a new note from Pivotal Research, again, increasing that price target to the highest that we've seen on Wall Street, 535 bucks a share, up from its previous $425 target. And if you take a look at where Netflix shares are trading right now, roughly at $420, that represents more than 25% upside. So there's a lot of reasons to be bullish here, at least from this analyst perspective, and a large part of that is this crackdown on password sharing, along with the ad-supported tier, which rolled out in November.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. Well, we're seeing a lot of excitement reflected in shares today. I think also the question here is what exactly these new users or users that are finally having their own accounts, what they're signing up for. Do we have any idea just in terms of whether or not they're opting for that ad tier versus paying the higher prices and not viewing ads?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, this data didn't specifically say whether it's for a premium tier or the ad-supported. I'm hoping that's something that Netflix can dive into a little more when we get their earnings call because I do think it's important to get a little bit more color around the ad tier since we haven't heard too much specifically from the company. We know that there's been third party data out there that shows positive momentum. But I do think investors need a little more clarity on the exact numbers.AKIKO FUJITA: You also wonder how much of these gains are a one-off. I mean, if you had an account with eight people on it, sure, you're going to get those to sign up right now.ALLIE CANAL: Exactly. Is it a singular family? Is it people just wanting to explore it? So I think that's something-- you've got to take the data with a grain of salt. And in the context of everything, I think it's a good thing, at least that we're getting some preliminary results from this.SEANA SMITH: Hopefully we'll hear more from Netflix on its next earnings call in just a few months. All right, Allie Canal, thanks.]"

This led to the robust first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales met.Earnings of $1.09 per share improved 12.4% from 97 cents per share reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Total sales of $4,494.7 million rose 3.7% year over year. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, comps improved 1%, driven by an increase in transactions. Strength in cosmetics and accessories aided the top line, with Midwest being the top-performing region.The company’s off-price model offers a strong value proposition and micro-merchandising that drive better product allocation and margins. Overall, gains at the core business demonstrated consumers' continued focus on value and ROST’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers.Ross Stores is on track with its store expansion plans. The company’s store expansion efforts are focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, it opened 19 stores, comprising 11 Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS stores. In fiscal 2023, ROST expects to open 100 stores, including 75 Ross and 25 dd’s DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include the plans to close 10 existing stores in fiscal 2023.Driven by these factors, management expects comps to remain flat, whereas we predict the metric to grow 0.1%. The bottom line is anticipated to be $4.77-$4.99 per share, whereas $4.38 per share was reported in the prior year and our estimate is pegged at $4.81. This includes an estimated benefit of 15 cents from the 53rd week.For second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects comps to remain flat year over year, in line with our estimate. Also, the bottom line is envisioned to be $1.07-$1.14 per share compared with our estimate of $1.12, whereas it reported $1.11 per share last year. Total sales are forecast to grow 1-4% year over year compared with our estimate of 2.5%.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 33.8% compared with the industry’s growth of 4.7%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, higher incentive compensation and elevated distribution expenses hurt Ross Stores’ fiscal first-quarter margins. The company’s operating margin of 10.1% contracted 70 bps year over year. For fiscal 2023, the metric is estimated to be 9.8-10.1%, down from the 11.3% reported in 2022 due to increased expenses related to incentive compensation and store wages.Rising costs are concerning. The cost of goods sold of $3,292.6 million increased 3% year over year. Higher distribution expenses rose 65 bps, owing to the unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from the company’s new Houston distribution center. Also, SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, expanded 110 bps year over year to 16.6%.ConclusionAlthough the above-mentioned inflationary pressures are concerning for the near term, we believe that ROST will sustain its momentum on the back of strong value offerings, store-expansion efforts and reduced freight expenses. A VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.5% raise optimism in the stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) Shares Could Be 44% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-shares-140030799.html,1686319230,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Key InsightsAmgen's estimated fair value is US$394 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$221 suggests Amgen is potentially 44% undervalued The US$254 analyst price target for AMGN is 36% less than our estimate of fair valueDoes the June share price for Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Amgen Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.76bUS$10.8bUS$10.1bUS$12.3bUS$13.1bUS$13.7bUS$14.2bUS$14.7bUS$15.1bUS$15.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 4.61%Est @ 3.86%Est @ 3.33%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.71% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$9.0kUS$9.3kUS$8.1kUS$9.0kUS$8.9kUS$8.6kUS$8.3kUS$8.0kUS$7.6kUS$7.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$84bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$271bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$271b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$126bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$210b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$221, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amgen as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.982. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AmgenStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Biotechs market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

RGLD announced that the Penasquito mine’s operator, Newmont Corporation NEM, ceased operations at the mine. The mine's operations were halted due to a strike called by the National Union of Mine and Metal Workers of the Mexican Republic.On Jun 7, Newmont received a strike notice demanding that the profit-sharing bonus granted in the Collective Bargaining Agreement be increased from 10% to 20%.Penasquito is undergoing continuous essential safety, security, and environmental monitoring and protection tasks. A timeline for restarting operations has not yet been provided.On all metal production from the Penasquito mine, RGLD holds a production payment equivalent to a 2% net smelter return royalty.Approximately 77% of Royal Gold’s revenues come from six properties — Mount Milligan, Andacollo, Pueblo Viejo, Wassa, Cortezm, and Penasquito. Penasquito generated 7.2% of Royal Gold’s revenues in 2022.In the first quarter of 2023, Royal Gold’s sales were impacted by lower gold and silver production at Penasquito . However, the company generated revenues of $170 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.9%. The upbeat performance can be attributed to higher gold and copper sales at Mount Milligan, a rise in silver sales at Khoemacau, increased gold production at Cortez, and contribution from the newly acquired royalties. The suspension of operations at Penasquito is likely to impact RGLD’s results till it resumes operations.In the March-end quarter, RGLD reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents.

To skip the details about the nuclear energy industry and upcoming technologies, you can skip to the 5 Nuclear Energy Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.Nuclear energy accounts for 10% of the global electricity generation. Nuclear energy is a much cleaner source of energy and it has helped avoid over 60 gigatons or 20% of the global carbon emissions in the last 50 years. Despite being relatively environmentally friendly, energy production through nuclear fission is costly. Recently, scientists have made a breakthrough in nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is the process of joining lighter atoms to form a heavier one. The process creates more energy than a nuclear fission reaction and costs significantly less.Fusion Industry Association believes that the first fusion power plant will be operational by 2030. On the other hand, a notable nuclear fusion startup, Helion Energy, claims that it will commercialize the first nuclear power plant by 2028. On May 10, the company announced its power purchase agreement with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the world’s first commercial fusion generator, which is expected to provide at least 50 megawatts of power.China has also started to take an interest in nuclear fusion start-ups. The Chinese auto manufacturer, NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) has invested in a nuclear fusion start-up, Neo Fusion, for research and development of nuclear fusion for commercial uses. In 2022, the nuclear fusion start-ups collected more than $2.8 billion in new private investment, bringing the total to $4.7 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) were also some of the names that invested in the research and development of this new technology. Both were part of a $250 million funding raise for TAE Technologies in July 2022. On May 31, the Department of Energy also announced $46 million in funding to eight fusion development companies. The US Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm said:Story continues“We have generated energy by drawing power from the sun above us. Fusion offers the potential to create the power of the sun right here on Earth [...] The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to partnering with innovative researchers and companies across the country to take fusion energy past the lab and toward the grid.”Two big names in oil and gas industry, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), have backed up Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Zap Energy, respectively. Shell Ventures’ venture principal, Liliia Chechel, said that these investments are quite high-risk but also have the potential to bring a high-reward long term.Nuclear Fission Energy IndustryCurrently, nuclear fission energy is used all over the world. According to the Energy Information Administration, it accounted for 18.9% of the total electricity generation in the United States in 2021. The United States is the top nuclear energy producer in the world and the industry contributes $60 billion to the US GDP annually.S&amp;P Global reports that around 355 gigawatts will be added to the global nuclear capacity between 2022 and 2025, mostly in mainland China. However, the increase in nuclear capacity will be significantly offset by the retirements in North America and Europe. Between the forecasted period, the global nuclear capacity is expected to increase from 415 gigawatts to 555 gigawatts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) predicts that by 2050, the nuclear generating capacity will increase to 873 gigawatts net electrical. By the end of the forecasted period, the IAEA believes that nuclear energy will account for 14% of global electricity generation.In the first quarter of 2023, some billionaires were quite bullish on nuclear energy stocks. Billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group increased its stake in Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) by 63986% and became the top hedge fund holder in the company while Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management initiated a position in Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) and was the second biggest stakeholder in the company.

Sales of items priced above $5,000, however, remained strong, Signet's Chief Financial Officer Joan Hilson said in an interview Friday.Signet is expanding services to drive spending and is counting on more sales of warranty and protection plans for watches and jewelry, Hilson said. A protection plan for a $3,200 tennis bracelet at Kay, for example, adds $315 to the price.Signet lowered its full-year revenue outlook on Thursday after the company flagged a “deteriorating” consumer environment.'TAKING DOLLARS AWAY'Retailers need to make up for the loss in sales due to falling demand from people who lack the means to regularly shell out on high-priced purchases.“Inflation and food and other costs are taking dollars away"" from the so-called aspirational shoppers, said Cowen and Company analyst Oliver Chen. Their desire to splurge in prior years represented a growth segment for luxury goods.Macy’s noted a drop in sales was most pronounced at its namesake department store chain, where 85% of customers' households earn $150,000 a year or less, CEO Jeff Gennette said on June 1. Some customers at the company's Bloomingdale's unit, which draws a wealthier clientele, were also pressured by inflation, but ""not at the same rate or intensity as Macy's,"" according to Gennette.Story continuesIn recent weeks, both Ralph Lauren and Capri , the owner of Versace, Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, disclosed that they are doubling down on their highest-end consumers as sales from aspirational shoppers lag.Ralph Lauren CEO Patrice Louvet said on May 31 the company had seen growth at full-price stores while outlet sales declined.“In North America specifically, there is continued divergence between our core high-value consumers and that subset of more value-oriented consumers,” he said. The company is stocking up on core products including Oxford shirts, blazers and dresses, betting that luxury consumers will be drawn to staples that can outlast seasonal fashion trends.Capri CEO John Idol told investors on May 25 it is pulling back inventory from department stores and other wholesale channels, which currently account for more than 20% of its sales. Idol said the company is able to sell at higher prices in its own stores than in department stores, where consumers seem resistant to recent price increases.As part of its ongoing “elevation strategy” for brands, he said the company is phasing out Versace-branded tee-shirts, pool slides, sneakers and other items that are “not really going to drive a luxury customer perception.""

NOV need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $8.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NOV shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NOV is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Technology Services industry that ranks in the Top 44% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 27 cents per share to 29 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about NOV right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

(NYSE:ZTS) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Zoetis The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.24bUS$2.58bUS$2.66bUS$2.81bUS$3.07bUS$3.21bUS$3.34bUS$3.45bUS$3.56bUS$3.65bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.70%Est @ 3.92%Est @ 3.38%Est @ 3.00%Est @ 2.73% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$79bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$40bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$61b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$164, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ZoetisStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about NextEra Energy (NEE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.NextEra currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.54, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.54 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.2% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NEECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for NextEra here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying NextEra, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NEE a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.11.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for NextEra.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip the details about the nuclear energy industry and upcoming technologies, you can skip to the 5 Nuclear Energy Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.Nuclear energy accounts for 10% of the global electricity generation. Nuclear energy is a much cleaner source of energy and it has helped avoid over 60 gigatons or 20% of the global carbon emissions in the last 50 years. Despite being relatively environmentally friendly, energy production through nuclear fission is costly. Recently, scientists have made a breakthrough in nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is the process of joining lighter atoms to form a heavier one. The process creates more energy than a nuclear fission reaction and costs significantly less.Fusion Industry Association believes that the first fusion power plant will be operational by 2030. On the other hand, a notable nuclear fusion startup, Helion Energy, claims that it will commercialize the first nuclear power plant by 2028. On May 10, the company announced its power purchase agreement with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the world’s first commercial fusion generator, which is expected to provide at least 50 megawatts of power.China has also started to take an interest in nuclear fusion start-ups. The Chinese auto manufacturer, NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) has invested in a nuclear fusion start-up, Neo Fusion, for research and development of nuclear fusion for commercial uses. In 2022, the nuclear fusion start-ups collected more than $2.8 billion in new private investment, bringing the total to $4.7 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) were also some of the names that invested in the research and development of this new technology. Both were part of a $250 million funding raise for TAE Technologies in July 2022. On May 31, the Department of Energy also announced $46 million in funding to eight fusion development companies. The US Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm said:Story continues“We have generated energy by drawing power from the sun above us. Fusion offers the potential to create the power of the sun right here on Earth [...] The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to partnering with innovative researchers and companies across the country to take fusion energy past the lab and toward the grid.”Two big names in oil and gas industry, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), have backed up Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Zap Energy, respectively. Shell Ventures’ venture principal, Liliia Chechel, said that these investments are quite high-risk but also have the potential to bring a high-reward long term.Nuclear Fission Energy IndustryCurrently, nuclear fission energy is used all over the world. According to the Energy Information Administration, it accounted for 18.9% of the total electricity generation in the United States in 2021. The United States is the top nuclear energy producer in the world and the industry contributes $60 billion to the US GDP annually.S&amp;P Global reports that around 355 gigawatts will be added to the global nuclear capacity between 2022 and 2025, mostly in mainland China. However, the increase in nuclear capacity will be significantly offset by the retirements in North America and Europe. Between the forecasted period, the global nuclear capacity is expected to increase from 415 gigawatts to 555 gigawatts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) predicts that by 2050, the nuclear generating capacity will increase to 873 gigawatts net electrical. By the end of the forecasted period, the IAEA believes that nuclear energy will account for 14% of global electricity generation.In the first quarter of 2023, some billionaires were quite bullish on nuclear energy stocks. Billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group increased its stake in Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) by 63986% and became the top hedge fund holder in the company while Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management initiated a position in Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) and was the second biggest stakeholder in the company. Ken Griffin’s and Steve Cohen’s firms have also been the most common names on our list as the former has made additional purchases or bought into six of these companies on the list while Steve Cohen’s firm has done the same in five of these companies.Some of the most prominent nuclear energy companies that billionaires are loading up on are NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG), and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ).10 Nuclear Energy Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we used Insider Monkey’s database of billionaire hedge fund managers and chose 10 nuclear energy companies they were buying into. These companies are directly involved in the nuclear energy industry and have ongoing operations, including operating nuclear reactors and mining uranium. We excluded the companies that still have nuclear projects under development. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Patterson Companies with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Patterson Companies How Fast Is Patterson Companies Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Patterson Companies has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. It's good to see that Patterson Companies' EPS has grown from US$1.73 to US$2.01 over twelve months. This amounts to a 16% gain; a figure that shareholders will be pleased to see.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Patterson Companies reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. While this doesn't ring alarm bells, it may not meet the expectations of growth-minded investors.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Patterson Companies' future EPS 100% free.Are Patterson Companies Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. Patterson Companies followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group. Indeed, they hold US$22m worth of its stock. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 0.8% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Patterson Companies, with market caps between US$2.0b and US$6.4b, is around US$6.8m.The CEO of Patterson Companies only received US$2.6m in total compensation for the year ending April 2022. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is Patterson Companies Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Patterson Companies is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Patterson Companies, but the fun does not stop there. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. We should say that we've discovered 3 warning signs for Patterson Companies (2 are a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Although Patterson Companies certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies, James Thompson, for US$1.3m worth of shares, at about US$132 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$116). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year QUALCOMM insiders didn't buy any company stock.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. QUALCOMM insiders own about US$158m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About QUALCOMM Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded QUALCOMM shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the QUALCOMM insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

97,587cf12b-2e08-3d29-9f6f-f6cb0708859b,EXPE,2023-06-10,The Case for Expedia Narrowing the Profit Gap With Booking Holdings,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/case-expedia-narrowing-profit-gap-211727386.html,1686345447,STORY,"['BKNG', 'EXPE', 'GPS']","[A research report contends Expedia will narrow the profit gap with Booking Holdings. Source: Alejandro Escamilla/Wikimedia Commons https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Man_with_smartphone_and_laptop_(Unsplash).jpg Alejandro Escamilla / Wikimedia CommonsThe traditional knock on Expedia Group in its matchup against rival Booking Holdings is that Booking has been way more profitable. And Booking can take those profits, plow them back into marketing, and win more market share.In a research report last week entitled, “EXPE 101: A Deep Dive on the Business, Industry &amp; Model,” Jake Fuller and Kevin Dolan of BTIG argued that Expedia is on the cusp of narrowing that profit gap.The report looks at the profit question in terms of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin. In 2022, Expedia’s EBITDA margin was 11.9% versus 31.3% at Booking Holdings. BTIG said Expedia is on track to boost its margin to more than 23% in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe.The Commission, Geography and Product FactorsThe primary factor in the gap between the two companies’ EBITDA margins, BTIG said, is their respective take rates, or commissions and fees per booking.Looking at their respective take rates in pre-pandemic 2019, BTIG notes that Expedia’s was much lower than Booking’s (11% versus 16%), and BTIG attributed that to Expedia’s heavier U.S. focus, where hotel chain commissions are lower than in a more independent hotel-minded Europe, which is Booking.com’s core market. Booking.com is Booking Holdings’ largest business and its flagship brand. Other brands include Priceline.com, Kayak, Agoda and OpenTable.Expedia’s revenue in 2022 was heavily weighted toward lodging, as shown in this graphic from BTIG.There is a historical irony to Booking having higher take rates than Expedia today. In the years after the Priceline Group, the former name of Booking Holdings, acquired Booking.com in 2005 and through around 2012, Booking.com took a ton of market share precisely because it was charging hotel commissions in the 10% neighborhood versus perhaps 20-30% for Expedia. That’s because Expedia was focused on the higher commission prepay hotel model while Booking.com solely did the lower-commission pay at the hotel model.Story continuesToday, both companies offer both models.Since the pandemic, Expedia “reduced fixed costs while Booking is pushing into the U.S. and air, all of which should lead to a narrowing of the margin delta over time,” BTIG said.Booking.com, traditionally focused in Europe, has been making market share gains in the U.S., and has been focused on expanding its flights business — where commissions for large online travel agencies may be in the 2-3% range — after years of offering accommodations only, with their higher commissions.So these are among the reasons the margin gap between the two companies is tightening, according to BTIG.A Bullish Assessment But Heavy Things on To-Do ListExpedia Group’s share price closed at $110.48, on Friday. BTIG has a “buy” rating on the stock, and a price target of $150. That’s based on “high single-digit revenue growth,” Expedia’s EBITDA margin expanding to more than 23%, and potentially $2 billion in stock buybacks.There are a couple of related things that could sidetrack Expedia Group in the short-term, however. After transitioning its Hotels.com brand to the Expedia.com tech platform in 2022 and seeing ample gross booking benefits, Expedia Group is in the midst of migrating vacation rental brand Vrbo to that same tech stack to gain efficiencies. That is a precursor to imminently launching a new loyalty program that unifies the previously separate Expedia and Hotels.com loyalty programs, and extends it to Vrbo for the first time.Tech and product integrations can be tough and if any of these moves have glitches or become problematic, they might interfere with BTIG’s upbeat forecast for Expedia Group.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the industry and its growth prospects, go to the 5 Quantum Computing Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the size of the quantum computing industry is expected to grow from $10.13 billion in 2022 to $125 billion by the end of this decade, reflecting an annual average growth rate of nearly 36.9%. To achieve long-term comparative growth, leading North American technology companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are making substantial investments in the field. Recognizing the immense potential of quantum technology, the Chinese government has also allocated a substantial budget of $10 billion for the research and development of quantum technologies. In addition to the tech giants, pure-play companies like Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI) and Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO) are notable players in the sector and among the leading quantum computing penny stocks. Quantum computing has attracted the attention of countries beyond North America and China, including India. The Indian government announced in February 2020 that it intends to invest $1.12 billion in quantum computing over the next five years. For a country like India, which is heavily dependent on its agricultural output, quantum computing can help address optimization challenges such as crop yield optimization, supply chain management, and resource allocation within the agricultural sector. In addition to agriculture, quantum computing also has the potential to impact the banking sector. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), one of the top quantum computing companies, believes that quantum computing can increase the share of wallets from existing customers and help reach 1.7 billion adults who are presently unbanked.Story continuesTransformative Impact of Quantum ComputingThe impact of quantum computing extends to the field of medical research and healthcare as well. Quantum computing can accurately model complex biological systems, such as protein folding, and enable scientists to design and optimize drugs more efficiently. According to Markets and Markets, the size of quantum computing in the healthcare sector is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.5%, from $85 million in 2023 to $503 million in 2028. In April, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced that it had partnered with International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) to gain access to the company’s quantum computing system. By leveraging the power of quantum computing, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) aims to accelerate the development of mRNA technology. While announcing the partnership, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel also stressed the importance of preparing for the era of quantum computing and recognized the transformative impact it can have on various industries.Experts believe that the growth outlook of the quantum computing industry depends on the expansion of quantum computing as a service (QCaaS). The service aspect of the quantum computing industry can play an integral role in numerous other sectors like chemicals, defence, and finance. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is a cloud-based platform that allows users to access and utilize quantum computing resources over the internet. It provides a way for individuals and organizations to harness the power of quantum computers without having to build and maintain their quantum hardware infrastructure. According to research conducted by a subsidiary of the Quantum Daily, the size of the QCaaS industry is set to grow from an expected $4 billion in 2025 to $26 billion by 2030. Overall, the industry is set to experience a CAGR of 80% from 2021 to 2030. The positive growth prospects have resulted in many investors being bullish on the best quantum computing stocks.10 Quantum Computing Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnPhoto by Anton Maksimov juvnsky on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey’s database of billionaire-owned stocks to shortlist the best quantum computing stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during Q1 2023.

Additionally, space-based assets are being increasingly used for reconnaissance, weather tracking, communication and navigation, and more.Notably, as the demand for space-based capabilities continues to mount, the Space-Based Infrared Surveillance (SBIRS) program by Lockheed Martin is developing infrared surveillance and missile warning satellites to conduct space surveillance.LMT’s Next-gen Geosynchronous spacecraft have more powerful sensors and other features that make them more resilient against attacks and emerging threats than current satellites. Going ahead, such features will likely help the company capture more shares in the expanding spacecraft market.Growth ProspectsIn recent times, rising global tensions have enticed developing nations like the United States to further strengthen its military prowess within the space domain. This is evident from the U.S. government’s fiscal 2024 defense budget that includes a significant spending plan of $33.3 billion in vital space capabilities.Such a stupendous budgetary amendment reflects massive growth prospects for Lockheed Martin and other defense players engaged in space science such as The Boeing Company BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX, in the days ahead.Story continuesBoeing is the prime contractor for the design, development, test and production of the space launch vehicle core stage and upper stages, as well as development of the flight avionics suite.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy Now.The best home builder stocks to buy now, which includes names like PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM), D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), have been on a roll over the past several months, with many companies in the space trading up by 40% to 80% from their October lows, when sentiment towards the housing industry was at a low point.That has investors wondering if the housing stock market today, including some of the 10 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds, is due for a correction in the short-term. Signs as to the strength of the current market are somewhat mixed.The Pending Home Sales Index fell by 5.2% in March, with pending transactions declining by 23.2% during the month from a year earlier. NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun noted that the lack of housing inventory has been a boon for housing prices, 28% of which are selling above their listing prices, but has otherwise proven to be a major impediment to sales.Real estate investors are also taking a breather from the market according to Redfin, as their home purchases declined by 48.6% in the first quarter, the biggest year-over-year decline the firm has ever recorded. Redfin cited higher interest rates and sliding rent prices as some of the reasons why investors aren’t nearly as bullish on the market at the moment. The firm recently noted that homebuying demand also dropped across the board during the four-week period ended May 25, sliding by 17.4% year-over-year.Luxury homebuilders are some of the most coveted housing stocks to buy, but even they’re not immune to the effects of rising interest rates, as luxury home prices declined in Q1 for the first time since the financial crisis according to data gathered from 46 leading markets by real estate tracking firm Knight Frank. After rising by 3% in the final quarter of last year, luxury home prices slipped by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2023. The price declines come on the heels of luxury home sales sinking by 38% during the three-month period ended November 30 according to Redfin, the largest drop on record.Story continuesIf some of that data makes you interested in uncovering some good housing stocks to short, especially given the recent run-up in share prices, then you’re not alone, as the home builder stocks ETF SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) is one of the most heavily shorted ETFs right now, with nearly 12 million of its shares being shorted.Home builder stocks certainly had a rough go in 2022 and rewarded shorts with nice gains, as existing home sales fell for 12 straight months through January 2023, which represented a new record, and potential buyers increasingly backed out of deals. That shaved billions of dollars in value off the 21 Largest Home Builders in USA, which measures home building stocks by market cap.That said, there are undoubtedly some good housing stocks to buy given some of the more encouraging signs in the market, including record low inventory and rising orders. Mortgage rates have also been on the downswing of late, making homes more affordable than they’ve been for a long time.The following housing stocks list showcases the best home builder stocks to buy now according to the select group of hedge funds that are tracked by Insider Monkey’s database. Let’s see which homebuilders the smart money is betting on for favorable long-term returns.11 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Breno Assis on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe following list of the best home builder stocks to buy now is ranked based on hedge fund sentiment as of March 31.

Tri Pointe Homes, Inc. (NYSE:TPH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24 Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) have long ranked as a few of hedge fund’s favorite homebuilder stocks. A homebuilder that hasn’t quite been able to attract the same level of smart money interest is Tri Pointe Homes, Inc.

Oppenheimer analyst Tyler Batory has a ‘Perform’ rating on the stock, with no price target, and would like to see progress on the company’s growth plans outside of California before leaning one way or the other on it.The Third Avenue Management Small-Cap Value Fund, which remains a TPH shareholder to this day, pointed out the value of Tri Pointe Homes, Inc. (NYSE:TPH)’s land assets in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“Single-Family (4.0% of assets): Tri-Pointe Holdings own highly attractive land assets in supply constrained geographies. The company have taken advantage of the single-family housing boom by monetizing assets at attractive prices despite a challenged cost environment. Tri-Pointe’s exceptional asset quality coupled with insatiable demand for residential housing should allow them to grow intrinsic value despite higher costs and supply chain delays industrywide.”10. Skyline Champion Corporation (NYSE:SKY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25 There’s been a decline in smart ownership of Skyline Champion Corporation (NYSE:SKY) over three of the past four quarters in the wake of the stock hitting a new high in hedge fund ownership in Q1 of 2022.

(SKY) also helped the Fund’s results. Skyline has executed well and has benefited from simplification of its product line. Broader industry trends, such as rising housing demand and improved financing for lower-income buyers, were additional tailwinds for Skyline’s stock.”T7. Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE:TMHC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 There was a 32% jump in hedge fund ownership of Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE:TMHC) during Q1, vaulting the company into the top ten most popular homebuilders among hedge funds. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management (908,789 shares) and Michael Gelband’s ExodusPoint Capital (173,690 shares) were some of the funds to add TMHC positions to their 13F portfolios in Q1.Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE:TMHC)’s home closings were down 8% year-over-year in Q1 to 2,541 homes, but the company nonetheless beat on both the top and bottom lines with its latest quarterly results, pulling in $1.66 billion in revenue and $1.74 in EPS, the latter beating estimates by $0.39 thanks to an 80 basis point improvement in gross margin.Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (NYSE:TMHC) expects to close between 10,000 to 11,000 new homes in its current fiscal year at an average selling price of $625,000. TMHC closed the first quarter with a book value of $44.04 per share, only slightly beneath the stock’s current selling price of $47.03.T7. KB Home (NYSE:KBH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 The number of smart money shareholders of KB Home (NYSE:KBH) took a big dip in Q2, as sentiment towards homebuilders began to sour, but it quickly rebounded in the following quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management (1.83 million shares) and Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management (1.67 million shares) are two of the biggest KBH shareholders among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s hedge fund database.KB Home (NYSE:KBH) shares have gained 53% this year despite a big orders miss in Q4 that stoked fears about a pending slowdown in housing demand. The company had less than 700 new orders during 2022’s final quarter, down by 80% year-over-year and falling drastically short of analysts’ expectations for 2,000 new orders.KB Home (NYSE:KBH)’s orders have improved recently however, with the company guiding for between 3,000 and 3,700 orders in the second quarter, and it had a hefty backlog of over 7,000 homes at the end of Q1. Barclays raised its price target on KBH to $56 from $51 last month and believes the market is underappreciating the effect that low housing inventory will have on housing starts.T7. M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 There was a 21% jump in hedge fund ownership of M/I Homes, Inc.

For the fourth quarter, M/I Homes hit record revenue of $1.22 billion and grew its operating margin by 1.4 percentage points to 25.7%.The Miller Value Deep Value Strategy likes the long-term tailwinds for homebuilders like M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO), as revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“During the quarter, our largest positive contributor was M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO), with share prices up in excess of 30%. Homebuilders in general had been under pressure for much of last year due to marketplace concerns on the potential impact from higher mortgage rates and lower housing affordability. However, as mortgage rates pull back the positive demographics and lack of housing supply over the past 10 years provides a very favorable long-term supply/demand picture for the industry that should shorten the current downturn. M/I Homes is nicely diversified covering multiple home-type categories, with properties in valuable local communities in the Midwest and Southeast (#2 in the Jon Burns Real Estate Consulting Submarket Desirability Index). M/I Homes’ attractive asset base, strong balance sheet and ongoing valuation discount to peers should provide an attractive long-term reward/risk investment opportunity.”6.

101,20842b30-c01f-35c8-94e7-ec17047c7d47,PHM,2023-06-10,PulteGroup (PHM) Is Up 5.33% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-phm-5-33-one-160007066.html,1686326407,STORY,['PHM'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at PulteGroup (PHM), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. PulteGroup currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PHM that show why this homebuilder shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For PHM, shares are up 5.33% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is up 3.4% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.54% compares favorably with the industry's 3.56% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of PulteGroup have risen 27.25%, and are up 61.88% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 7.94% and 5.97%, respectively.Investors should also take note of PHM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PHM is averaging 2,677,782 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with PHM.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PHM's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.44 to $9.13 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PHM is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep PulteGroup on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -0.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson &amp; Johnson belongs, has lost 2.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.62 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.01 indicates a change of +3.3% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $24.66 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. The $98.86 billion and $101.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.1% and +2.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $24.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Excluding dividends, only 9 out of 187 REITs have been profitable over that time frame. Just as things were beginning to improve post-pandemic, REITs were confronted with the worst inflation in decades and multiple Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to combat that inflation.While it seems that the Fed may be nearing the end of its long series of interest rate hikes, new recessionary fears have taken hold on Wall Street. While a few sub-sectors such as hotel, diversified and residential REITs have begun to show strength, others such as office and retail REITs have been especially hit hard by these fears.This week the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange, is holding an investor conference at the New York Hilton Midtown Manhattan in New York City. Over 1,000 real estate and other companies are expected to attend. The conference gives investors the opportunity to meet with management teams from dozens of REITs and get answers to questions concerning the present environment as well as future projections.Some REITs, such as First Industrial Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE: FR) and Caretrust REIT Inc. (NYSE: CTRE), updated investor presentations on company websites ahead of the conference. Several REITs have already given presentations in which CEOs have sought to reassure investors that financials are on the upswing in their companies.Take a look at a few of the REITs that have given presentations:Don't miss: The Company That Built Elon Musk's Tiny Home Is Partnering With This REIT To Solve The Affordable Housing Crisis And Provide A Unique Investment OpportunityRealty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) is a San Diego-based, triple-net lease retail REIT with over 12,400 properties around the world. The “Monthly Dividend Company,” as it is widely known, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 and an S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, with 635 consecutive monthly dividends paid and 120 dividend increases since 1994. It is one of the most widely held REITs among investors today because of its stability and growth. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994, Realty Income has had a 14.6% compound annual total return.Story continuesOn June 6, CEO Sumit Roy told investors at the NAREIT conference that Realty Income’s portfolio consists mostly of recession-resilient convenience and grocery stores. Addressing the potential for an economic slowdown, Roy said, “People still need to check out groceries.”Sumit Roy also noted that between 2018 and 2022, Realty Income’s adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) grew 5% annually despite the COVID-19 pandemic and higher borrowing costs. He further reassured investors that Realty Income is investing in real estate that still has attractive cap rates and that occupancy in its portfolio as of March 31 was 99%.Year to date, Realty Income’s total return is negative 3.95%.Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) is a Richmond, Virginia-based hotel REIT, formed in 2007. Its owns 28,984 rooms in 220 hotels in 87 markets across 37 states. Its portfolio includes 96 Marriotts, 119 Hiltons, four Hyatts and one independent hotel.On June 6, CEO Justin Knight spoke with investors at the NAREIT conference about Apple Hospitality REIT’s rebound in occupancy from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, an improving balance sheet and how artificial intelligence (AI) may impact the hotel industry by making it more efficient.Knight cited Apple Hospitality REIT’s low debt and leverage as company attributes during rising interest rate periods and reassured investors that “continued strength in leisure demand and increased business travel” has positively impacted Apple Hospitality’s earnings in the first quarter. He added that Apple Hospitality has plenty of funds to continue to underwrite properties in the future.In recent months, there have been several positive developments for Apple Hospitality. First-quarter FFO of $0.34 beat estimates by a penny and was 21.6% better than FFO of $0.28 in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $311.45 million beat the estimates by $16.72 million and was 19.6% above the revenue from the first quarter of 2022.There have also been insider purchases by two company executives within the last month. Year to date, Apple Hospitality REIT’s total return is 1.61%.Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE: CCI) is a Houston-based specialized REIT that focuses on owning, operating and long-term leasing of cell towers. Crown Castle works with businesses and governments to design and build solutions that meet connectivity needs like wireless coverage and custom fiber optic networks. It has a market cap of $55.97 billion, making it one of the largest REITs in the U.S.Crown Castle was founded in 1994 with a portfolio of 133 cell towers. Less than 30 years later, Crown Castle has over 40,000 towers and 85,000 miles of fiber and 120,000 “small cells” (base stations like 5G that are used to enhance cellular network coverage and capacity) in its portfolio. Most of its towers — 75% — are in the 100 largest areas of the U.S.On June 6, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Schlanger spoke with investors at the NAREIT conference. Schlanger told the audience that Crown Castle has two goals — the first is to grow its dividends per share by around 7% to 8% per year by offering its wireless carrier customers the lowest-cost solution to building out a network.Crown Castle’s second goal is to grow its revenue on the 40,000 cell tower assets it already owns. Cell tower leasing makes up about 70% of Crown Castle’s revenue.Schlanger wrapped up the presentation by saying that Crown Castle has a tremendous opportunity in the small cell building area of the business, which he sees growing exponentially over the next decade. Year to date, Crown Castle has a total return of negative 17.18%, so it has not performed well in the present economic environment.One thing is for sure — executives will always paint the rosiest picture possible of their companies. Whether these presentations succeed in assuaging investor concerns over the economy and company earnings remains to be seen.

Yet, regulatory issues surrounding GRAIL are putting huge pressure on the bottom line. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Illumina delivered better-than-expected first-quarter 2023 earnings and revenues. Consolidated revenues were up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance range. Building on strong global interests, the company executed robust shipments of NovaSeq X instruments, exceeding its first-quarter guidance of 40 to 50 shipments.Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenues were up 1% sequentially. Total sequencing activity on the company’s connected high- and mid-throughput instruments grew 6% sequentially and 3% year over year. Research &amp; Applied grew 7% sequentially. Clinical sequencing activity growth remained robust, up 7% from Q4 2022 and 15% year over year.Geographically, Americas revenues grew 5% sequentially and exceeded Illumina’s expectations on stronger-than-anticipated NovaSeq X shipments.Illumina, Inc. PriceIllumina, Inc. PriceIllumina, Inc. price | Illumina, Inc. QuoteGRAIL continues to witness demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. GRAIL revenues of $20 million in the first quarter grew 100% year over year, driven primarily by the accelerated adoption of Galleri.Illumina is currently keeping up well with its goals to strengthen its foothold in the multi-billion gene sequencing worldwide market with some highly-competitive products in its existing portfolio and pipeline. This market is developing rapidly on a global scale,  allowing the company to witness persistent growth in the number of non-invasive prenatal test  samples.Genetic disease testing (GDT) had a record first quarter. GDT consumable shipments grew 7% year over year, driven by the broader adoption of whole genome sequencing globally and increased demand for rare disease treatment. Coverage continues to grow for whole genome sequencing in patients with rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases.The company also saw additional evidence generation, with the European Society of Human Genetics updating its guidelines to recommend increased adoption of whole genome sequencing in diagnostics and increased coverage for rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases.On the flip side, in the first quarter of 2023, the year-over-year performance remained sluggish. Core Illumina revenues fell 10% at CER. Core Illumina Sequencing Consumable revenues were down 12% year over year. Sequencing Instrument revenues for Core Illumina were down 27% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. The decline was primarily due to lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments compared with the previous year’s quarter and reduced mid-throughput shipments led by fewer NextSeq 550 placements in China.An expected COVID-19 surveillance headwind affected Core Illumina’s revenues, including sequencing consumables revenues.Further, contraction in both margins raises apprehension. Illumina emphasized its commitment to achieving higher adjusted operating margins from Core Illumina in the next two years.Meanwhile, the chaos surrounding the GRAIL divestment is worrisome and is creating pressure on the bottom line. On the first-quarter earnings call, Illumina noted that GRAIL must be held and operated separately and independently from Illumina pursuant to the interim measures ordered by the European Commission, which prohibited the company’s acquisition of GRAIL under EU Merger Regulation.In the past year, Illumina has underperformed its industry. The stock has lost 12.9% compared with the industry's 6.9% fall.Story continuesKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Penumbra PEN, Lantheus LNTH and Neuronetics STIM.

HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH.Industry: HMOsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2105670/5-hmo-industry-stocks-to-watch-as-technology-expenses-take-a-toll?art_rec=home-home-investment_ideas_stocks-ID07-txt-21056705 HMO Industry Stocks to Watch as Technology Expenses Take a TollThe U.S. health insurance industry, referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is expected to gain on the back of growing premiums and an expanding customer base, thanks to the well-performing Government business. The industry players have an active merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy in place. Though technology investments are made to boost operational efficiencies, these often escalate costs for industry players. Shortage of medical personnel across the United States is a concern. Despite the challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, The Cigna Group, Humana Inc., Centene Corporation and Molina Healthcare, Inc. appear well-placed to counter the industry headwinds.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO Industry A High Technology Expense Level: Telehealth services were prevalent in the United States prior to the COVID-19 pandemic but their usage was not as widespread as it has been since the onset of the pandemic. Per a report by Grand View Research, the global telehealth market is anticipated to witness a 24% CAGR over the 2023-2030 period. This impressive growth forecast indicates that demand for digital healthcare services will continue to be high. HMO players are therefore compelled to undertake technology investments to build telehealth platforms. Needless to say, the platforms fetch a steady revenue stream for industry players and boost their operational efficiencies. But tech investments might escalate costs and erode the margins of health insurers.Shortage of Medical Staff: A dearth in the availability of medical personnel is taking a toll on the efficient functioning of hospitals nationwide. An increase in the number of nurses reaching retirement age, greater life expectancy of the overall population and faculty shortages in nursing schools are some of the factors triggering a scarcity in the nursing workforce. Health insurers collaborate with hospitals, physicians and other facilities to offer discounted care access to plan members. Therefore, the effectiveness of services remains a crucial factor behind health plan renewals. A shortage in the nursing workforce can reduce a hospital’s ability to deliver quality care services and indirectly affect the customer base of HMO companies. Healthy membership growth is crucial to the premiums of health insurers.Rising Customer Base: Most of the participants in the HMO space distribute cost-effective health plans through their Government business and upgrade them from time to time. The strength of such plans leads to federal or state contract wins for HMO players.  Plan upgrades as well as contract wins bring in more customers for the industry participants and provide an impetus to premiums. Also, these provide them an opportunity to serve different underserved U.S. communities and bolster their geographic footprint. Given an aging U.S. population, the solid demand for Medicare plans (meant for 65 years and above), which form part of the abovementioned Government business, is expected to continue.Active M&amp;A Moves: An active M&amp;A strategy offers an opportunity for the industry players to advance their capabilities, enter new regions, delve deeper into existing ones and grow their customer base. The HMO stocks gain from diversification benefits that result from an active pursuit of M&amp;A deals and attain a competitive edge over industry peers. Though interest rates were increased aggressively by the Fed in order to tame inflation, the percentage of increase seems to have somewhat slowed down. This, in turn, is likely to bring down borrowing costs, making it easier for companies to opt for loans to finance M&amp;A deals and avoid complete exhaustion of cash reserves. According to Tom Miles and Brian Healy, Co-Heads of Americas M&amp;A at Morgan Stanley, the pace of such deals is likely to pick up in the second half of 2023 and beyond.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #181, which places it in the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth looking at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Vs. Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Medical sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has gained 1.5% against the Medical sector’s decline of 7.5%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 7% in a year.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 17.25X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.03X and the sector’s 22.32X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.49X and as low as 12.93X, with the median being at 17.69X, as the chart below shows.5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe present five stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Considering the current industry scenario, it might be prudent for investors to retain these stocks in their portfolio, as these are well-placed to generate growth in the long haul.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.UnitedHealth Group: Based in Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group benefits from its solid segmental performance. While a strong Government business empowers the health insurer to gain more Medicare and Medicaid customers, the Optum unit gains on buyouts and utilization of advanced technology and market-leading health analytics. A robust telehealth services suite developed through significant investments enables UNH to deliver virtual healthcare services effectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.97 per share, indicating a 12.5% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 12.6% growth from the year-ago actual. UNH’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 4.04%. Its shares have gained 3.7% in the past three months.Cigna: This Connecticut-based health insurer continues to benefit from the strength exhibited by its two growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. While a solid specialty pharmacy services suite drives the growth of the Evernorth platform, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from a growing customer base within its U.S. Government and U.S. Commercial businesses. New collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems strengthen the capabilities of the health insurer.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.81 per share, implying 6.6% growth from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests a 4.6% improvement from the year-ago actual. CI’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 6.56%. Even though its shares have declined 3.8% in the past three months, solid fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Humana: Headquartered in Kentucky, Humana is driven by higher premiums and an expanding customer base across its Medicaid and Medicare businesses. The health insurer teams up with well-reputed organizations to launch new plans or upgrade features within the existing ones. The strength of such plans leads to numerous contract wins and renewed agreements for Humana from various federal or state authorities. A series of acquisitions undertaken over the years, including those of Family Physicians Group, iCare and Inclusa, has diversified income streams and extended the nationwide presence of HUM.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humana’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $28.25 per share, indicating a 11.9% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 10% growth from the year-ago actual. HUM’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 8.87%. Its shares have rallied 3.7% in the past three months.Centene: Based in Missouri, Centene benefits from a strong Managed Care business resulting from growth in Medicaid membership and the Medicare business, and several contract wins. It follows an inorganic growth route, which, in turn, bolsters its capabilities and provides an opportunity to boost membership. A well-diversified healthcare suite and solid nationwide presence have fetched numerous contract wins, and deal renewals for CNC. The health insurer also resorts to divestitures for intensifying focus on growing its core Managed Care business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.43 per share, which implies a rise of 11.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 0.7% growth from the year-ago actual. CNC’s earnings outpaced estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark twice, the average being 0.59%. Its shares have rallied 3.3% in the past three months.Molina Healthcare: This California-based health insurer benefits from higher premium revenues and a growing customer base, resulting from well-devised Medicare and Medicaid plans. Several contract wins and renewals are likely to drive membership growth in the days ahead. Frequent acquisitions pursued by MOH have solidified its capabilities and resulted in an extensive nationwide foothold. It also resorts to tactical cost-cutting measures that aid margins.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molina Healthcare’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $20.14 per share, indicating a 12.4% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues hints at a 3.3% improvement from the year-ago actual. MOH’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 5.42%. Its shares have gained 7.5% in the past three months.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

121,00f81779-afab-34d6-8c01-486ee4b8a101,NOC,2023-06-10,Lockheed (LMT) Wins $122M Deal to Support Space Vehicles,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-lmt-wins-122m-deal-105900216.html,1686308340,STORY,"['LMT', 'BA', 'NOC', 'RTX']","[Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT Space business unit secured a modification contract involving Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) Geosynchronous Space Vehicles. The award has been offered by the U.S. Space Force Space Systems Command, Space Sensing, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA.Details of the DealValued at $122.2 million, the contract is projected to be completed by May 31, 2024. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will be involved in planning and preparation of post-launch activities for all three Next-Gen OPIR Geosynchronous Space Vehicles.The latest modification brings the total cumulative face value of the contract to $7.22 billion. Work related to the deal will be executed at Sunnyvale, CA.Role of Spacecraft in SurveillanceIn recent times, armed forces across the globe have been significantly relying on space-based capabilities in the fields of missile warning and missile defense. Additionally, space-based assets are being increasingly used for reconnaissance, weather tracking, communication and navigation, and more.Notably, as the demand for space-based capabilities continues to mount, the Space-Based Infrared Surveillance (SBIRS) program by Lockheed Martin is developing infrared surveillance and missile warning satellites to conduct space surveillance.LMT’s Next-gen Geosynchronous spacecraft have more powerful sensors and other features that make them more resilient against attacks and emerging threats than current satellites. Going ahead, such features will likely help the company capture more shares in the expanding spacecraft market.Growth ProspectsIn recent times, rising global tensions have enticed developing nations like the United States to further strengthen its military prowess within the space domain. This is evident from the U.S. government’s fiscal 2024 defense budget that includes a significant spending plan of $33.3 billion in vital space capabilities.Such a stupendous budgetary amendment reflects massive growth prospects for Lockheed Martin and other defense players engaged in space science such as The Boeing Company BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX, in the days ahead.Story continuesBoeing is the prime contractor for the design, development, test and production of the space launch vehicle core stage and upper stages, as well as development of the flight avionics suite. On Nov 16, 2022, the space launch system (SLS) rocket was successfully launched as part of the Artemis I Mission, which was an uncrewed test flight to validate the rocket component and systems in preparation for future crewed missions.Meanwhile, Boeing is building the core stages for Artemis II, III and IV, as well as the first Exploration Upper Stage, which will replace the Interim Cryogenic Upper Stage in future Artemis missions.Boeing boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 18% from the 2022 reported figure.Northrop’s Space Systems is an industry-leading provider of end-to-end space and launch systems and capabilities serving national security, civil and commercial customers. The company supports NASA’s Artemis program by providing solid rocket boosters for the NASA Space Launch System and the abort motor and attitude control motor for the Orion spacecraft’s Launch Abort System.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 4.7% from the 2022 reported figure.Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space unit’s end-to-end space solutions deliver mission breakthroughs ranging from missile warning and intelligence to weather, navigation and beyond. The Space segment includes the constellation of multiple satellites currently on orbit. The Control segment consists of ground-based stations that are responsible for tracking, monitoring and updating the satellites.RTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 8.3% from the 2022 reported figure.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Lockheed’s shares have gained 7.2% compared with the industry’s 1.2% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$46.27 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$42.13. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In total, Wells Fargo insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Wells Fargo better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Wells Fargo insiders own about US$112m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Wells Fargo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Wells Fargo.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The AMDAC also voted 19-2 supporting the antibody’s favorable benefit risk profile in children aged up to 24 months, who are vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.A final decision on the BLA is expected in third-quarter 2023. Though advisory committee recommendations are not binding on the FDA, they are taken into consideration before arriving at a final decision.If approved with the designated time period, AstraZeneca/Sanofi expects to launch nirsevimab in the country during the 2023/2024 RSV season. Per the companies, the FDA indicated that it will expedite the BLA review timeline.In the year so far, shares of AstraZeneca and Sanofi have increased 9.5% and 6.4%, respectively. During the same period, the industry has moved up 0.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe BLA is being supported by data from the comprehensive nirsevimab clinical development program, including the phase III MELODY study, the phase II/III MEDLEY study and multiple phase IIb studies. Data from these studies showed that single dose of the antibody demonstrated high, consistent and sustained efficacy and favorable safety against RSV disease.Beyfortus was authorized in the European Union in November2022 to prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease (“LRTD”) in newborns and infants during their first RSV season.Sanofi and AstraZeneca entered into an agreement in 2017 to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Per the terms, AstraZeneca is responsible for development and manufacturing activities, while Sanofi is responsible for commercialization activities and record revenues.Story continuesUp until last month, there were no FDA-approved vaccines against RSV infections anywhere in the world. Last month, the FDA approved two RSV vaccines developed by Pfizer PFE and GSK GSK, respectively, for older adults aged 60 years and older. These vaccines are to be marketed by Pfizer and GSK under the trade names Abrysvo and Arexvy, respectively.Pfizer’s Abrysvo is currently under FDA review for preventing medically attended lower respiratory tract disease (MA-LRTD) and severe MA-LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals. Last month, an FDA advisory committee voted in favor of the RSV vaccine for infants. The committee believes the available data supports the efficacy and safety of the RSV vaccine. The committee voted 10 to 4 on safety and 14 to 0 on effectiveness. A decision from the FDA is expected this August.Earlier this month, GSK announced that it also received approval in the European Union for Arexvy in older adults aged 60 years and above. In the meantime, Pfizer’s RSV vaccine candidate is under review for older adults and maternal immunization in Europe.Zacks RankAstraZeneca and Sanofi carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Workers enjoy the flexibility in managing their schedules and reduced commuting stress while companies get access to a broader talent pool as they can hire people from anywhere in the world.But former PayPal Holdings Inc. executive David Sacks is not a fan of work-from-home (WFH) policies.“It’s time to admit that remote work doesn’t work,” he said in a recent tweet. “WFH Friday is a four-day work week. Full WFH is a two-day work week.”Sacks points out that when people are not in the office, every interaction has to be planned in advance. And that means “a lot of information-sharing doesn’t happen.”“Remote is a great lifestyle, not a way to build a great company,” he concluded.Sacks knows a thing or two about building companies. He was the founding chief operating officer of PayPal. Later he built the enterprise social networking platform Yammer, which was acquired by Microsoft Corp. in 2012 for $1.2 billion.And he’s not the only member of the PayPal Mafia — a group of former PayPal employees and founders who went on to develop other tech companies — who doesn’t like the concept of remote work.Check out:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here's how to invest in the city's growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Remote Work Is ‘Morally Wrong’Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk is likely the most famous member of the PayPal Mafia. Musk has revolutionized the electric car industry with Tesla and is making significant strides in space exploration with SpaceX.And he’s not sold on the concept of remote work, either.“I’m a big believer that people are more productive when they are in person,” he said in a recent interview with CNBC.To Musk, the issue extends beyond productivity.Story continuesHe noted that workers who make things people consume can't work remotely. And to assume that these workers have to work on-site while you don't is “morally wrong.”“It's like, really, you're going to work from home and you're going to make everyone else who made your car come work in the factory? You're going to make the people who make your food ... that they can't work from home?” Musk said. “The people that come fix your house, they can't work from home, but you can? Does that seem morally right? That's messed up.”Musk went so far as to say that “the laptop class is living in la la land.”Work-From-Home Stocks Vs. Office REITsThe rise of remote work has brought about significant shifts in the investment landscape.For instance, companies providing remote work collaboration tools, cloud-based services and digital communication platforms have experienced significant growth opportunities since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.There are now exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that help investors tap into the segment.For example, the Direxion Work From Home ETF (NYSEARCA: WFH) aims to track the Solactive Remote Work Index. It holds 40 stocks, including companies that create popular solutions for enabling remote work such as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM).While remote work has presented new opportunities for some companies, it has also had a notable impact on commercial real estate, particularly office buildings. This shift in work dynamics has prompted companies to re-evaluate their office space requirements, leading to shifts in demand.But if more leaders share Sacks and Musk’s view and bring their employees back on-site, office properties could see better days ahead.Investors who want to bet on a bounce in this segment can look into real estate investment trusts (REITs) that focus on office buildings, such as Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) and Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. (NYSE: ARE).If you prefer real estate segments with a bit less uncertainty, you might want to look into single-family rentals. After all, no matter what happens to remote work, people will always need a place to live and a growing number of people are now renting instead of buying. These days, there are even options to invest in rental properties with as little as $100.Read next:This Former Google Engineer Built A Platform That Lets You Buy Shares Of Single-Family Rentals With The Click Of A ButtonElon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

130,bd73131b-29f7-31b0-bf9c-c1dde118b14b,PYPL,2023-06-10,Future of Finance: PayPal’s Fernandez da Ponte on how B2B payments could spur crypto adoption worldwide,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/future-finance-paypal-fernandez-da-101500857.html,1686305700,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Welcome to Future of Finance, where Fortune asks prominent people at major companies about their jobs, how their firm fits into the crypto ecosystem, and what this all means for how we use money.Jose Fernandez da Ponte is four years into his second stint at PayPal, and to say the global financial landscape has changed since he left for banking giant BBVA in 2015 would be quite the understatement.Now a senior vice president overseeing all things blockchain and crypto, Fernandez da Ponte, who’s also worked for Hewlett Packard and McKinsey, discussed why it’s vital for U.S. politicians to provide clarity on digital assets—and how, even with regulation by enforcement at peak levels, he still sees the whole situation as “glass half full.”(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)You’ve held several key roles at PayPal. How would you describe this one?I have the luxury of leading our digital currencies business, and we’ve been involved in that for the last—I would say in earnest—four years or so. We believe as a company that a significant part of commerce and payments is going to move to digital payment rails, and that’s why we’ve focused on digital currencies writ large—we care about cryptocurrencies but also fiat-backed stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.Doing payments for the better part of the last 20 years, this is probably one of the first times that I see technology that can substantially redefine payment rails—cost, speed, programmability—things we couldn’t do before that we can do now. So that’s kind of the genesis block of why we got involved in the space.What drew you, perhaps on a more personal level, to crypto?I got into the space in around 2015, when I was working in banking, and the first thing that I was doing was trying to move funds from bank accounts in one country to a different country using one of the blockchain protocols. If you look at financial innovation, a lot of that in the last 20 to 30 years has been on the front end—user experience—but not so much on the way that money moves. When you’re able to do things that represent an upgrade on the traditional correspondent banking system, it really opens up a ton of possibilities. And that’s what got me excited.Story continuesWhen you're able to reduce that cost using this technology, then you can start to do things that you couldn't do before—you can start to do micropayments of cents without a fixed fee, you can start to open streaming payments, a channel between you and me for a fixed fee, and start to move value one way or the other. It’s a very exciting set of possibilities.In the crypto world and the digital currency space, there is a ton of focus on the transfer of value from one wallet to another wallet. Part of what we bring into the equation, and where we think we can help, is that a payment is way more than just moving the value between two wallets. A payment is, in essence, the settlement of a contract, the settlement of a liability. And that means that if I send money to you to send me a good, I need to be able to get that money back if the good never arrives. There is a contractual component of a payment that goes beyond the movement of value between wallets. And that's where the programmability of blockchains plays a really important role.I probably use Venmo or Paypal a couple times a week. When I talk to other people, many are like, “What’s the point of crypto if I can just use Venmo?” How do you answer that question?That’s a very good use case, and—(laughs)—I agree with you, Venmo is a fantastic platform. But let me give you one example of something that you can do with crypto now that you couldn't do before.As you know, we enabled on-chain transfer, so people on the platform have the ability to move crypto in and out of PayPal wallets, a year ago. And now, thanks to crypto, you can actually send value from a Venmo wallet to a PayPal wallet. There is a little bit of this fallacy in use cases, when people ask, “Why do I need crypto to do this?” or “Why do I need a blockchain to do this?” In many cases, it is not a requirement. There are other ways to do it. But this is a very effective way of doing it.A lot of your work has had an international focus. When it comes to PayPal users overseas—everyday people more so than companies—how does the blockchain help them?I wouldn't claim by any means that we are in mainstream adoption territory yet, but definitely we are a bit beyond that [initial phase]. People are going to be using it, definitely, and it’s going to be more useful when you have stable, digital instruments that run on blockchains. That's why we spend so much time thinking about stablecoins and CBDCs, and, basically, if you have a Bitcoin or Ether balance with us, you can use it to pay anywhere that PayPal is accepted.In the crypto ecosystem, I do think that you will see cross-border ecommerce is a use case that we'll see more and more. Imagine that I am a consumer who's in a Latin American country and I want to buy from a merchant in the U.S, but I don't have a credit card enabled for international transactions. I think that we will see, in some of the specific verticals, that digital currency is a really good fit.Can you talk a bit more about what’s next in terms of adoption?Gaming is a good example—anything that is media related. And I think that we'll see adoption in business-to-business payments before we see that broadly in consumer-to-consumer payments. Imagine you are a midsize business in the U.S., and you have a supplier that is abroad. Your alternative today to pay them is that you need to make a wire transfer, and it's going to cost you 50 to 100 bucks. You need to do it 9 to 5, Monday through Friday, during banking hours, and that money isn’t going to be transferred for three days, right? Now, if you have an instrument where you have 24/7 availability, instant settlement, it's dollar-denominated, and it’s cheaper, that’s the rational decision. In a global context, I think that's where you will start to see more and more adoption of this.B2B makes a ton of sense. Do you have any kind of timeline in mind for when consumers similarly embrace this tech?If I had a crystal ball? Three to five years out. My hope is that in five years we will be in a place where maybe there’s $1 trillion in stablecoin-denominated assets. And when you multiply that by the velocity with which stablecoins circulate, you’re starting to talk about trillions in commerce volume that can be enabled. Really, it’s less of a forecast and more hope and intention.If Congress were to pass any sort of crypto law, do you agree it would probably be something less spicy at this point—probably some regulations around stablecoins? And if that happened, what happens next?I think that it’s super important that there is clarity on stable coins in the U.S.—just look at what is going on in the world. There is very clear regulation in places like Europe about what you can and cannot do in the stablecoin space. There is sustained progression toward clarity in places like the UK and Singapore and Hong Kong and Japan. The world is moving toward more clarity, not less clarity. And it is important that the U.S. is part of the team that you see in that market.I do believe I am kind of on the “glass half full” part of the discussion here. I am relatively hopeful that we will see legislation that is passed for stablecoins in the close future. And there seems to be momentum in Congress. I think it is fundamentally important that there is that clarity in the U.S., because if not, there is a risk that the U.S. falls behind in this whole digital policy space.Sticking with more macro-level themes, what comes to mind when you hear the phrase “future of finance”?I think the most macro thing—stablecoins and cryptocurrencies are one flavor of that—is the tokenization of assets, different assets that exist in physical or traditional form. By tokenizing them, you make them easier to share, to fractionalize, to move. If you are an asset management firm, you might be thinking about how you can tokenize a money market fund. Or if you are an art dealer, how you can tokenize illiquid assets like art. Or if you are a company in the entertainment space, you're trying to figure out how to tokenize a physical ticket to get into a concert.This technology enables creating digital representations of assets that wasn’t possible in the past. And in different parts of finance—from wealth management to banking to payments to remittances—the macro theme for me is the tokenization of all formerly liquid assets.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

131,86540f97-ecd0-3494-a5cb-c22416a48e1d,IBM,2023-06-10,International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 57% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-nyse-120027086.html,1686398427,STORY,['IBM'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in International Business Machines implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 38% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessEvery investor in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 57% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that International Business Machines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see International Business Machines' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. International Business Machines is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.9% of the company stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of International Business Machines Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$87m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 43% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over International Business Machines. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for International Business Machines (1 is a bit unpleasant)  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the industry and its growth prospects, go to the 5 Quantum Computing Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the size of the quantum computing industry is expected to grow from $10.13 billion in 2022 to $125 billion by the end of this decade, reflecting an annual average growth rate of nearly 36.9%. To achieve long-term comparative growth, leading North American technology companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are making substantial investments in the field. Recognizing the immense potential of quantum technology, the Chinese government has also allocated a substantial budget of $10 billion for the research and development of quantum technologies. In addition to the tech giants, pure-play companies like Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI) and Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO) are notable players in the sector and among the leading quantum computing penny stocks. Quantum computing has attracted the attention of countries beyond North America and China, including India. The Indian government announced in February 2020 that it intends to invest $1.12 billion in quantum computing over the next five years. For a country like India, which is heavily dependent on its agricultural output, quantum computing can help address optimization challenges such as crop yield optimization, supply chain management, and resource allocation within the agricultural sector. In addition to agriculture, quantum computing also has the potential to impact the banking sector. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), one of the top quantum computing companies, believes that quantum computing can increase the share of wallets from existing customers and help reach 1.7 billion adults who are presently unbanked.Story continuesTransformative Impact of Quantum ComputingThe impact of quantum computing extends to the field of medical research and healthcare as well. Quantum computing can accurately model complex biological systems, such as protein folding, and enable scientists to design and optimize drugs more efficiently. According to Markets and Markets, the size of quantum computing in the healthcare sector is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.5%, from $85 million in 2023 to $503 million in 2028. In April, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced that it had partnered with International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) to gain access to the company’s quantum computing system. By leveraging the power of quantum computing, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) aims to accelerate the development of mRNA technology. While announcing the partnership, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel also stressed the importance of preparing for the era of quantum computing and recognized the transformative impact it can have on various industries.Experts believe that the growth outlook of the quantum computing industry depends on the expansion of quantum computing as a service (QCaaS). The service aspect of the quantum computing industry can play an integral role in numerous other sectors like chemicals, defence, and finance. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is a cloud-based platform that allows users to access and utilize quantum computing resources over the internet. It provides a way for individuals and organizations to harness the power of quantum computers without having to build and maintain their quantum hardware infrastructure. According to research conducted by a subsidiary of the Quantum Daily, the size of the QCaaS industry is set to grow from an expected $4 billion in 2025 to $26 billion by 2030. Overall, the industry is set to experience a CAGR of 80% from 2021 to 2030. The positive growth prospects have resulted in many investors being bullish on the best quantum computing stocks.10 Quantum Computing Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnPhoto by Anton Maksimov juvnsky on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey’s database of billionaire-owned stocks to shortlist the best quantum computing stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during Q1 2023.

135,4322b591-88fc-3db2-bf29-deefdf07050a,IBM,2023-06-10,International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-ibm-130013303.html,1686315613,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +11.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 11.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.98 per share, indicating a change of -14.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.76 indicates a change of +4.9% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $61.89 billion and $64.14 billion estimates indicate +2.3% and +3.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.4%. EPS of $1.36 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.15%. The EPS surprise was +7.09%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

STZ has been witnessing momentum, owing to strength in its beer portfolio, with the continued robust performance of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra, and newer brands, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada. Moreover, the company’s premiumization strategy is playing out well, evident from accelerated growth of the Power Brands.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year's sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.1% and 9.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported number.The stock has risen 2.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s and the Consumer Staple sector’s growth of 1.6% and 0.7%, respectively. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Growth DriversConstellation Brands is on track with its premiumization strategy. In the wine &amp; spirits segment, the company’s premium brands have been witnessing accelerated growth over the past few quarters. Its high-end Power Brands, including The Prisoner Brand Family, Kim Crawford and Meiomi, were key growth drivers in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.Depletions for the wine and spirits segment were partly aided by a high-single-digit rise in The Prisoner Brand Family, low-double-digit gains for High West Whiskey and mid-single-digit growth in the Ignite portfolio. The company’s Aspira portfolio yielded double-digit shipment growth.Within the beer segment, gains from the premiumization efforts are evident from the growth in traditional beer, as well as the flavors category, including seltzers, flavored beer, RTD spirits and flavored malt beverages. The company is making investments to fuel the growth of its power brands through innovation, capitalizing on priority and consumer trends, with successful product introductions.As a part of its efforts, Constellation Brands is also on track with its plans to invest in the next phase of capacity expansion in Mexico. This will help meet the potential demand for the high-end Mexican beer portfolio, including the emerging Alternative Beverage Alcohol sub-space, which includes hard seltzers. The expansion will support an addition of up to 30 million hectoliters of modular capacity and includes the construction of a brewery in Southeast Mexico’s Veracruz. It also targets continued expansion and the optimization of the existing Nava and Obregon breweries.Constellation Brands has been significantly gaining from strength in the beer business over the years. Despite a decline in sales in the fourth quarter, the company witnessed a strong depletion volume on solid beer business trends. The beer segment reported depletion growth of 6.3%, benefiting from the continued robust performance of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra, and newer brands, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada. Depletion volume increased 9% for Modelo Especial and about 45% for Modelo Chelada. Additionally, depletion for Corona Extra improved 4%.For fiscal 2024, Net sales are likely to increase 7-9% for the beer segment, with the operating income rising 5-7%.Story continuesHeadwinds to AddressConstellation Brands has been witnessing softness in its wine &amp; spirits business for a while now. Sales for the wine and spirits segment decreased 14% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. Shipment volume in the wine and spirits business declined 22.1% year over year, whereas depletions dropped 4.9%. Organic sales for the segment declined 9%, including an 18.9% dip in organic shipments. For fiscal 2024, the company expects organic net sales for the wine and spirits business between down 0.5% and up 0.5%.Moreover, it has been witnessing weak margins stemming from inflation, higher operating costs from brewery expansions and elevated marketing expenses. Higher COGS, driven by elevated raw material, packaging and logistics costs, hurt the beer business’ operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter. Persistent inflationary pressures and higher SG&amp;A expenses have also been weighing on results, despite improved pricing.Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely, Molson Coors TAP, Monster Beverage MNST and PepsiCo Inc. PEP.Molson Coors currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). TAP has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.1%, on average. Shares of TAP have rallied 26.8% in the past year.

Netflix's stock rose after data from Antenna showed a jump in subscribers as the company's password sharing crackdown kicked off in the U.S. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the trending tickers of the day.Video Transcript- Let's take a look at some of those individual movers. First up, Tesla shares edging higher, locking in its 11th straight day of gains. Now, this ties its longest win streak ever, which took place back in January of 2021. The rally in Tesla coming from a pileup of good news here. The latest headline being its EV charging partnership with GM. Akiko, adding to the momentum that we saw last week following the announcement with Ford, seems like it's good news here for Tesla.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, there's the expectation now that they've got this partnership with GM, in addition to Ford, that this NACS, which is the charging port that Tesla uses, that could become the new standard here in North America at least. What's interesting to me as we've been saying, is just how the other EV charging companies have been getting hit, have gotten hit on the back of this. But it certainly feels like it's a big one all around, not just for Tesla but for adoption of EVs.All right. Netflix posting gains on a report the streaming giant saw US signups rise by the most in at least four and 1/2 years. This boost in user acquisition coming in days after Netflix has cracked down on password sharing last month. The data, of course, coming from analytics platform Antenna. It is a good sign, of course, at a time when people or investors were concerned about how, how much churn we'd likely see as a result of the password crackdown.- Yeah. And the big question, you brought this up earlier, is whether or not the type of gains that we have seen maybe not to the degree, but how much of that momentum is going to continue. Obviously, when we saw the crackdown here in the US of the password sharing, many of those users who were affected did sign up right away for new accounts. The question going forward is just how much runway Netflix has.But shares hitting the highest level that we have seen since February of 2022. The street very positive though on this move from Netflix. Pivotal was out with a new note today, just calling this a unique tech growth story here. And I think that's what a lot of people are just trying to figure out. When we look at the two-year chart of shares still under pressure, off just over 13%, what that subscriber growth looks like here going forward given the fact that there is some saturation here in the US.]"

Oppenheimer Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Colin Rusch joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this means for Tesla and the EV charging landscape.Video Transcript- Tesla shares higher after GM followed in Ford's footsteps with plans to use the EV maker's charging network. The stock extending recent gains, up another 4% today. On track to close higher for the 11th trading day in a row. For more on what this means for Tesla and the broader EV market, we want to bring in Colin Rusch, Oppenheimer senior research analyst.Colin, it's good to see you here. So what does this mean for Tesla? Has Tesla won the EV charging wars?COLIN RUSCH: I don't know if there's an EV charging war. What they're trying to do is facilitate EV adoption and a couple of things are happening with this. Is one, you're getting a standardization on plugs. It's just going to simplify, you know, the manufacturing for those connectors across the industry. We think that's a net positive and a savings for everyone across the industry.Secondly, we don't need a million networks of charging. And so Tesla's already built out a fairly effective fast charging network, but that's not necessarily going to be the bulk of how charging happens. Most of the charging actually happens at home or at work, where most of these cars sit idle and it's really a top up market. And so you've got some fast charging that'll happen, but the bulk of the charging actually happens with level one and level two chargers.And so you know, the stock that we cover, ChargePoint, has sold off today and we think that's going to ultimately be a net winner with some buying opportunity right here on some confusion around how the usage patterns are really changing for vehicles as we move towards EVs.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Colin, I'm glad you brought that up. Because it was interesting to see the reaction to ChargePoint, as well as EVgo, some of these other charging companies, you sort of wonder, well, you need all these chargers to really get the EV adoption going. I want to point to a conversation we had with ChargePoint CEO, Pasquale Romano earlier, in the week when we asked him specifically about the Tesla-Ford partnership. Take a listen to what he had to say.Story continuesPASQUALE ROMANO: We don't want our customers to have to assign a particular-- our business customers-- to have to assign a particular parking space to a connector type because you'll never get that mix right and that mix will change over time. You want to make sure that any car can park in any parking space and use the charger, because that's just what's simple for consumers. That's just what consumers want. So we're looking to innovate there to make sure that we can adequately support both standards and potentially even go beyond the consumer having to carry that adapter in their car.AKIKO FUJITA: So that came on Monday, sort of already hinting that they are looking at the NACS offering as well. When you look at how ChargePoint has moved down more than 10%, is it a little overdone, number one? And is there a bit of a misunderstanding here? I mean, could ChargePoint also be a big winner on the back of this?COLIN RUSCH: I think both of the answers or the answer to both those questions is yes. You know, certainly this is overdone. I think folks misunderstand what's actually at stake here. Charging in the EV world is really an amenity, particularly in public charging. It's not necessarily where most of the charging happens.And so when you look at, you know, retailers or multifamily homes, the charging actually is an add on. You know, it's cheaper than a cup of coffee for folks at work and you're providing coffee for your employees. You know, it's one of the cheapest forms of advertising and marketing for retailers.And so for us, I don't see there being a slowdown in terms of charging infrastructure that gets built out. And ChargePoint is really well positioned with the back end software. They're really the only company that has fully integrated software with their chargers and the accounting systems and operating systems in the market for their customers.And so for me, I think it's a huge opportunity for them as you start to look at standardization. The companies that can actually provide the full suite of solutions across their platform are really going to benefit from this. And Tesla is really only concerned with facilitating and adoption. And so they're not going to go after charging as a key market for the company. It's really part of their strategy around enabling EVs and helping drive the cost of EVs lower. And so I think ChargePoint ends up being the specialist in this space that really ultimately wins a lot of market share and a lot of value capture over time.AKIKO FUJITA: Let me pick up on that point. I mean, what is the calculation for Tesla? First, it was Ford. Now, it's GM. They aren't just doing this out of the goodness of their heart, right? I mean, there's got to be a business case here. What is it?COLIN RUSCH: You know, I think this is really more coming from Ford and GM. At this point, when they look at the number of variables that they have to solve to move through this technology transition, you know, providing charging and enabling charging for their customers is one of the key ones that it's actually quite expensive. Tesla has invested an awful lot of money, billions of dollars, in building out this network.And for them, you know, they're just providing service and renting out that asset. And so for them, you know, it has been part of a customer service offering that they recently started charging new customers for. You know, initially it was a free service for customers and now they're starting to charge some of their competitors for it. And so it's a profit pool for the company on some sunk costs.So for Tesla, I think it's just monetizing an asset that they have. And for these other OEMs, it's a realization that they can simplify their lives and really focus on some of the challenges that they have ahead in terms of moving through the transition towards building EVs, which is actually much more difficult than I think most of these OEMs ever really anticipated.- Colin how much revenue-- how much more revenue do you think Tesla is going to generate as a result of these partnerships here with GM and Ford? And to that point, now they have partnerships with their superchargers. There has been some talk from Musk just about licensing their self-driving technology. Is that a move that you think makes sense?COLIN RUSCH: You know, what we've seen the company do in the past is really offer up some of the non-cutting edge technology for competition, whether it's battery technology or otherwise. And so I think it helps some of those competitors move through some of the early stages of commercialization. But it really doesn't change Tesla's technology lead to a real material extent.From a revenue standpoint, you know, we don't have much detail on what's going to really-- these deals will amount to. At the end of the day, the real driver for Tesla right now is selling cars and then upselling services and features on those vehicles over time. And that's the real thrust here for us is that it's going to enable more adoption of EVs. And Tesla is in a great position from a product perspective and our cost perspective to really take share in the market. And as we see some of the supply chains simplify, it makes things easier for them as the largest buyer of a lot of these components to continue driving costs down and continue to maintain their advantage versus peers.AKIKO FUJITA: What does this ultimately mean for Tesla's competitors in the EV space, whether that is somebody like a Rivian or somebody like Volkswagen, that is not using NICS right now? Are they going to be forced to change as well?COLIN RUSCH: You know, it's a little unclear. The electrical industry has not provided a standard yet for the industry. It's a little curious, that sort of thing typically happens early on in a new market and it's taken the standard setters longer than we would have anticipated to come to a conclusion on that. For some of these other folks, it's just-- it's an adapter that they need to put on there or their customers are going to have to use.So it's a nominal cost. It's not a big deal. But it is a level of convenience, per Pasquale's comments earlier, that consumers would like to make this easier and they certainly-- folks are trying to work in that direction. But I don't think it's a real meaningful change for any of the competition as we move towards standards.- All right. Oppenheimer Senior Research analyst, Colin Rusch. Thanks so much. Have a good weekend.]"

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for McCormick What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$727.7mUS$903.6mUS$890.6mUS$900.0mUS$989.0mUS$1.02bUS$1.04bUS$1.07bUS$1.09bUS$1.11bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.65%Est @ 2.49%Est @ 2.38%Est @ 2.30%Est @ 2.24% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$681US$791US$730US$690US$710US$682US$654US$626US$600US$574(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.7bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$24bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$24b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$12bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$19b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$90.1, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McCormick as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for McCormickStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

LW appears in great shape. The frozen potato product company has been benefiting from its efficient pricing initiatives and efforts to boost capacity. Encouragingly, management raised its fiscal 2023 guidance when it reported third-quarter results.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 16.1% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 6.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year earnings per share (EPS) has jumped from $3.91 to $4.51 in the past 60 days.Lamb Weston Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLamb Weston price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lamb Weston QuoteFactors Working WellLamb Weston’s top line has been benefiting from a robust price/mix, as witnessed in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The price/mix increased 31%, reflecting gains from pricing actions across its core business units undertaken to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation. On its third-quarter earnings call, management highlighted that its ability to counter input cost inflation through pricing actions is likely to remain favorable.In the Global segment, the price/mix grew 33% in the third quarter on gains from domestic and international pricing actions to counter inflationary pressures. The Foodservice segment’s price/mix benefited from the carryover benefits of pricing actions undertaken in the previous year and moves made in fiscal 2023 to battle inflationary headwinds.Meanwhile, in the Retail segment, the price/mix surged 44%. The upside can be attributed to the carryover impact of pricing actions on the branded and private-label portfolios and pricing actions carried over in fiscal 2023.Lamb Weston has been focused on boosting production capacity and fueling long-term growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Lamb Weston’s capital expenditures came in at roughly $500 million. This reflects construction costs as the company expands its processing capacity in Idaho, China and Argentina. For fiscal 2023, LW expects cash used for capital expenditures in the band of $700-$725 million.In September 2022, Lamb Weston unveiled expansion plans for french fry processing capacity in Argentina with the construction of a new manufacturing unit in Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires. In July 2021, the company had announced the expansion plan for french fry processing capacity at its existing American Falls, Idaho facility, with the envisioned capacity to manufacture more than 350 million pounds of frozen french fries and other potato products annually. In March 2021, LW had revealed plans to build a new french fry processing facility in Ulanqab, Inner Mongolia, China.Lamb Weston’s efforts to boost offerings and expand capacity enable the company to effectively meet rising demand conditions for snacks and fries. In February 2023, Lamb Weston unveiled that it concluded the buyout of remaining equity interests in its European joint venture with Meijer Frozen Foods B.V. The move strengthens the company’s ability to serve customers across key markets globally.Further, Lamb Weston (in July 2022) bought an additional 40% stake in Lamb Weston Alimentos Modernos S.A.— which is its joint venture in Argentina — taking its total ownership to 90%.

Gains from prudent acquisitions have also strengthened the portfolio of this manufacturer, marketer and distributor of spices, seasonings, specialty foods and flavors.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 27% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 6.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year earnings per share has risen by a penny to $2.62 in the past 30 days.McCormick is expected to witness top-and-bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 results later this month. The consensus mark for sales is pegged at nearly $1.7 billion, suggesting 8.1% growth from the year-ago period reported figure. The consensus estimate for second-quarter earnings currently stands at 56 cents a share, indicating a 16.7% increase from the year-ago period earnings. Let’s delve deeper.McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated QuoteFactors Working WellMcCormick’s CCI program has been helping the company reduce costs and enhance productivity. Although MKC’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted gross profit margin contracted year over year, cost savings from the CCI and GOE programs and favorable pricing offered some respite. Such cost savings, coupled with effective pricing actions, are likely to continue enhancing the company’s profits in the future.In addition, McCormick is on track with normalizing its supply-chain costs and increasing efficiencies while strengthening the ability to service customers. Management is also undertaking streamlining actions in its entire organization.The company’s GOE program is yielding favorable results, with first-quarter savings in tandem with management’s expectations.  McCormick expects its GOE program to scale up as fiscal 2023 progresses.The company is on track to generate cost savings of $75 million in 2023 through its actions to normalize supply-chain costs and streamline its organization. It envisions its 2023 adjusted gross margin to expand between 25 to 75 basis points year over year, reflecting a positive impact of pricing and cost savings from the CCI and GOE programs.Further, McCormick has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions to grow its portfolio. In December 2020, the company bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories.In November 2020, McCormick also completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand. The buyout of Cholula accelerates McCormick’s growth potential across the condiment platform and widens the product portfolio in the hot sauce category.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFuture Looks BrightFor fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to increase 5-7% from the fiscal 2022 levels. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, are likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement.The adjusted operating income is likely to increase 9-11%. Management expects adjusted earnings in the band of $2.56-$2.61 per share in fiscal 2023, suggesting 1-3% growth. The bottom line is likely to be fueled by a solid operating performance, partly offset by increased interest expenses and a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate.Other Appetizing StocksSome other top-ranked food stocks are Lamb Weston LW, The Kraft Heinz Company KHC and Conagra Brands CAG.Lamb Weston, which operates as a frozen potato product company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

According to PwC, while companies and their employees are determining their preferred work arrangements, some firms are choosing to retain their office spaces as a precautionary measure or due to lease obligations. However, an increasing number of companies are downsizing or opting not to renew expiring leases. Consequently, vacancy rates in the office sector continue to rise gradually, which is in contrast to other major property sectors. Additionally, many tenants are resorting to subletting their office spaces until their leases expire. On the other hand, occupancy levels for logistics real estate in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are currently at or near all-time highs. There are also positive indications suggesting that the retail sector is experiencing a revival. Investment managers interviewed by PwC highlighted the robust operational performance of their retail portfolios in the United States and Europe. This upward trend extends beyond the more resilient sub-sectors such as convenience stores, grocery stores, and retail parks. Selected shopping centers are demonstrating strong performance in the market as well. Don't Miss: 20 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USAThe commercial real estate sector continues to face significant economic uncertainty for the remainder of 2023, with several key factors impacting its future. These factors include the uncertain interest rate environment and the evolving nature of office spaces. Over the period from March 2022 to May 2023, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates consistently for ten consecutive times. However, according to JPMorgan, multifamily properties continue to thrive. While the rate of rent increases has declined, the national vacancy rate for multifamily properties was 4.5% at the end of 2022. Vacancy rates vary across different metro areas, but the median vacancy rate in the country as of April stands at 3.9%. Story continuesFurthermore, JPMorgan noted that despite e-commerce comprising around 15% of retail, not all consumer needs can be met online. Certain services, like nail salons, barbershops, and sports bars, still require in-person visits. The industrial sector has experienced significant growth driven by e-commerce and the on-demand economy as well. The vacancy rate for distribution and warehouse spaces hit a record low of 4.1% in the second half of 2022, but it increased slightly to 4.2% in the first quarter of 2023. While demand for office space has been impacted by remote and hybrid work models, A-class office properties continue to perform well, especially those with leases lasting 10 years or more, which may be able to weather market corrections. On the other hand, B- and C-class office buildings, particularly those with shorter leases in non-prime locations, face challenges as the workplace evolves. The real estate industry is undergoing significant changes driven by technology advancements and increased capital. FortuneBuilders observed that online property listing platforms, smartphone apps, virtual reality, and blockchain technology are expected to have a profound impact on real estate transactions. Buyers and renters now have access to online platforms, leading to more informed property searches. Moreover, blockchain technology is likely to be utilized for legal components of transactions, such as transferring deeds and sharing important documents, increasing trust and reducing intermediaries. Virtual reality will also gain popularity, allowing potential buyers to virtually tour properties without physically visiting them. Meanwhile, millennials are entering the real estate market with a preference for suburban areas and walkable neighborhoods, presenting new opportunities for investors in mixed-use and retail spaces. Overall, the future of real estate will be shaped by technological advancements and shifting buyer preferences.In this exciting real estate landscape, some of the best commercial stocks to invest in include CBRE Group, Inc.

Mario Gabelli’s GAMCO Investors is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $103 million. In addition to CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE), Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:ARE), Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. (NYSE:RHP) is one of the top commercial real estate stocks to invest in. Here is what Diamond Hill Small Cap Fund has to say about Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. (NYSE:RHP) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Ryman Hospitality is a well-run, resiliently positioned REIT that has carved out a core competency in the group-travel business. The company owns 5 of the 10 largest convention-oriented resorts under the Gaylord Hotel brand, and it has a small entertainment business which owns iconic assets like the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium. We believe the group-travel business will normalize and potentially be of heightened importance given the increase in remote work. Pandemic-related industry-wide disruptions coupled with the inflationary dynamic in construction should result in minimal new industry capacity over the next five years, favoring Ryman’s portfolio of assets.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy12 Cities Where Home Prices are Going Up Right Now Disclosure: None. 10 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

DECK’s focus on expanding its brand assortments, bringing a more innovative line of products and optimizing omnichannel distribution, bodes well.Buoyed by the aforesaid tailwinds, this major footwear and accessories designer shares have appreciated 29.5% against the industry’s 1.2% dip. An impressive long-term projected growth rate of 18.4% further highlights the strength of this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Analysts seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Deckers’ fiscal 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $4 billion and $21.56, respectively. These estimates suggest growth of 9% and 11.3%, respectively, from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s corresponding figures. The consensus estimate for next fiscal year’s sales and EPS of $4.3 billion and $25, respectively reflects a corresponding increase of 8.6% and 15.8% year over year.Let’s Delve DeepDeckers is targeting profitable and underpenetrated markets to boost overall sales. In addition, the HOKA ONE ONE brand is also performing impressively. The brand continues to build its customer base through a combination of robust product innovation and a disciplined marketing approach. Deckers is progressing toward building HOKA ONE ONE into a major multibillion-dollar player, elevating the UGG brand as a global lifestyle brand with diverse product offerings and enhancing the direct-to-consumer (DTC) business. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Management has also been constantly developing its e-commerce portal to efficiently resonate with the evolving trends. The company is focused on opening smaller concept omnichannel outlets and expanding programs such as Retail Inventory Online, Infinite UGG, Buy Online, Return In Store and Click and Collect to enrich customers’ shopping experience. Markedly, DTC revenues grew 19.5% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.Furthermore, Deckers is focused on product and marketing strategies that are more skewed toward customers. The company has also been focusing on expanding its product categories per the customer purchasing trends that differ with the weather. Its brand strength also bodes well. We believe that management’s focus on ramping up inventory, optimizing channel mix to fulfill consumer demand, scaling production to support the growth of brands and implementing targeted price increases should position Deckers well for growth.Deckers envisions fiscal 2024 net sales of about $3.950 billion. This suggests an increase of about 9% from the $3.627 billion reported in fiscal 2023. This growth is likely to be driven by the HOKA brand as it continues to outpace expectations in DTC and expand market share across global wholesale access points. The HOKA brand is likely to rise by 20% for fiscal 2024, implying over $280 million of incremental revenues compared to the prior year. Also, management forecasts experiencing sturdy DTC demand and growth as it focuses on driving consumer acquisitions and retention, margin improvement and marketplace management. Management expects UGG’s revenues to increase in the low single digits, supported by international expansion and a flat U.S. marketplace, as the company focuses on maintaining the brand’s pull model.Story continuesEye These Solid PicksSome better-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, Crocs CROX and lululemon athletica LULU.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

The surge in mega-cap tech stocks, easing inflation, stronger-than-expected corporate earnings and hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its interest rate-hike cycle have helped the index to recover from the lows seen in October last year.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, has jumped about 12%. Nearly half the stocks in the index have declined, with most of the winners concentrated on the tech sector with just a small group of stocks, including Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia NVDA, Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms META and Tesla TSLA. Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett calls these stocks the “Magnificent Seven,” which accounted for 90% of the gains in the S&amp;P 500 so far this year (read: Nvidia Hits Trillion-Dollar Market Cap: 5 ETFs to Track).The artificial intelligence (AI) boost has also pushed Marvell Technology (MRVL), and American Micro Devices AMD higher. Apart from the tech sector, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL made it to the top five best-performing stocks on the index.Additionally, corporate America’s shift of focus to structural benefits and booming AI will continue to drive the stock market higher. Further, an improving earnings picture and hopes of easing policy should also aid the S&amp;P 500. According to CMEGroup's Fedwatch tool, markets are pricing in a 65% chance that the Fed will pause its historic interest rate hiking campaign in the June meeting.Most Wall Street analysts recently raised their target price on the S&amp;P 500 for this year for the second time in many weeks. The equity strategy team at RBC Capital Markets raised its year-end price target on the index to 4,250 from 4,100, while Bank of America gave a call for the S&amp;P 500 to hit 4,300 by the end of the year (read: Analysts Raise S&amp;P 500 Target Price: ETFs to Buy).Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.Story continuesSPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.4% of assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, healthcare, financials and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $402.2 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. The product trades in a heavy volume of around 68 million shares a day on average, ensuring higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors. SPY has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).Below we have highlighted the above-mentioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.Best-Performing Stocks of SPYNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

160,30bb9c26-b908-342c-8fd9-b74407e47636,ROST,2023-06-10,Healthy Demand to Aid Ross Stores (ROST) Amid Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/healthy-demand-aid-ross-stores-124000952.html,1686314400,STORY,"['ROST', 'TJX']","[Ross Stores ROST has been gaining from positive customer responses to its improved merchandise. This led to the robust first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales met.Earnings of $1.09 per share improved 12.4% from 97 cents per share reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Total sales of $4,494.7 million rose 3.7% year over year. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, comps improved 1%, driven by an increase in transactions. Strength in cosmetics and accessories aided the top line, with Midwest being the top-performing region.The company’s off-price model offers a strong value proposition and micro-merchandising that drive better product allocation and margins. Overall, gains at the core business demonstrated consumers' continued focus on value and ROST’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers.Ross Stores is on track with its store expansion plans. The company’s store expansion efforts are focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, it opened 19 stores, comprising 11 Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS stores. In fiscal 2023, ROST expects to open 100 stores, including 75 Ross and 25 dd’s DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include the plans to close 10 existing stores in fiscal 2023.Driven by these factors, management expects comps to remain flat, whereas we predict the metric to grow 0.1%. The bottom line is anticipated to be $4.77-$4.99 per share, whereas $4.38 per share was reported in the prior year and our estimate is pegged at $4.81. This includes an estimated benefit of 15 cents from the 53rd week.For second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects comps to remain flat year over year, in line with our estimate. Also, the bottom line is envisioned to be $1.07-$1.14 per share compared with our estimate of $1.12, whereas it reported $1.11 per share last year. Total sales are forecast to grow 1-4% year over year compared with our estimate of 2.5%.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 33.8% compared with the industry’s growth of 4.7%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, higher incentive compensation and elevated distribution expenses hurt Ross Stores’ fiscal first-quarter margins. The company’s operating margin of 10.1% contracted 70 bps year over year. For fiscal 2023, the metric is estimated to be 9.8-10.1%, down from the 11.3% reported in 2022 due to increased expenses related to incentive compensation and store wages.Rising costs are concerning. The cost of goods sold of $3,292.6 million increased 3% year over year. Higher distribution expenses rose 65 bps, owing to the unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from the company’s new Houston distribution center. Also, SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, expanded 110 bps year over year to 16.6%.ConclusionAlthough the above-mentioned inflationary pressures are concerning for the near term, we believe that ROST will sustain its momentum on the back of strong value offerings, store-expansion efforts and reduced freight expenses. A VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.5% raise optimism in the stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries. TGLS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Analog Devices with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Fast Is Analog Devices Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Analog Devices' EPS has grown 34% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Analog Devices shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 29% to 35%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$323m. We note that this amounts to 0.4% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Analog Devices but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Should You Add Analog Devices To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Analog Devices has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.

That is because the Jan 19, 2023 $30 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Exelon shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Exelon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 47 cents per share to 48 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Exelon right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Akamai Technologies, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.096 = US$705m ÷ (US$8.2b - US$836m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Akamai Technologies has an ROCE of 9.6%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the IT industry average of 14%. See our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Akamai Technologies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Akamai Technologies.The Trend Of ROCEThe returns on capital haven't changed much for Akamai Technologies in recent years. The company has consistently earned 9.6% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 107% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.On a side note, Akamai Technologies has done well to reduce current liabilities to 10% of total assets over the last five years. This can eliminate some of the risks inherent in the operations because the business has less outstanding obligations to their suppliers and or short-term creditors than they did previously.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Akamai Technologies' ROCELong story short, while Akamai Technologies has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 15% to shareholders over the last five years. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Akamai Technologies that you might find interesting.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Compared to traditional borosilicate packaging, Velocity Vials offer a 20-50% improvement in efficiency, up to a 96% reduction in glass particulates and a 3x reduction in the likelihood of damage that leads to cracks and breaks.The Velocity Vial technology platform offers easy access to pharma and biotech companies into Corning’s game-changing pharmaceutical packaging technology. It helps them enhance vial quality, improve filling-line productivity and accelerate the global delivery of injectable medicine. On the other hand, strategic partnerships with pharma firms enable Corning to extend its manufacturing footprint, localize its supply chains and support the purchase of Velocity Vials through a network of selling partners.SGD Pharma is the latest to join a growing network of leading pharma manufacturers adopting Corning’s cutting-edge coating technology. The manufacturing of Velocity Vials at SGD Pharma’s facility in Vemula, India, is expected to begin in 2024, while pharmaceutical tubing production is likely to commence in 2025.Notwithstanding challenging macroeconomic conditions, Corning expects to witness 6-8% compound annual sales growth and 12-15% compound annual earnings per share growth through 2023 while investing $10-$12 billion in research, development &amp; engineering, capital, and mergers and acquisitions. It plans to expand its operating margin and return on invested capital and deliver $8-$10 billion to shareholders, including an annual dividend per share increase of at least 10%. To achieve its goals, the company expects to add an incremental $3-$4 billion in annual sales and improve profitability by the end of 2023.The stock has lost 7.5% over the past year against the industry’s rise of 16.7%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCorning currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Comcast What Is Comcast's Net Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Comcast had US$100.7b in debt in March 2023; about the same as the year before. However, it does have US$5.54b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$95.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Comcast's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Comcast had liabilities of US$32.4b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$143.6b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$5.54b in cash and US$12.3b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$158.2b.This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$167.7b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on Comcast's use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Comcast has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.6 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 5.8 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. We saw Comcast grow its EBIT by 6.3% in the last twelve months. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Comcast's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, Comcast produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 65% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewNeither Comcast's ability to handle its total liabilities nor its net debt to EBITDA gave us confidence in its ability to take on more debt. But we do take some comfort from its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. We think that Comcast's debt does make it a bit risky, after considering the aforementioned data points together. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since leverage can boost returns on equity, but it is something to be aware of. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Comcast that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Semiconductor Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.The advancement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is expected to bring new opportunities for the semiconductor industry. According to Fortune Business Insights, the size of the global semiconductor industry is expected to rise from $573.4 billion in 2022 to $1,380.8 billion in 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 12.2%. The storage sub-industry in the semiconductor industry will experience the highest tailwinds in terms of top-line and bottom-line increase from the advancements in AI and ML. Meanwhile, the computing, memory, and networking solutions sub-industries will have a favourable outlook as well due to these developments.According to research by McKinsey and Company, the semiconductor industry generates earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $5 billion to $8 billion from the AI and ML industry. It must be noted that these numbers only reflect 10% of the full potential of EBIT that can be generated from these sub-industries. The New York-based management consulting firm expects the number to reach $35 billion to $40 billion annually in the next two to three years. Moving forward, the value is projected to increase further to a range of $85 billion to $95 billion annually four or more years into the future. This would be equivalent to nearly 17% of the expected 2023 annual revenue of $532 billion for the semiconductor industry, according to Gartner.Outlook for Recovery and Future GrowthPresently, the semiconductor industry is experiencing weak demand from both consumers and businesses, driven by economic uncertainty. This has led to an oversupply of chips, resulting in an inventory buildup and a decline in average selling prices (ASPs). As a result, the industry is expected to witness an 11.2% year-over-year (YoY) decline in revenue in 2023. The memory sub-industry is expected to be the worst impacted by the weakness of the overall industry as it is anticipated to see its annual revenue decline by 35.5% in 2023 to a sum of $92.3 billion. Despite the current challenges, there is an expectation of a strong recovery in the semiconductor industry. It is expected that the industry will bounce back in 2024 with a remarkable 70% increase in revenue, indicating a significant turnaround. Some of the best semiconductor stocks in the industry include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).Story continuesA survey by KPMG provides further support to the forecast of oversupply in the semiconductor industry. According to the survey, 24% of the executives believe that the semiconductor industry is already facing the issue of oversupply. Meanwhile, 31% of the respondents believe that the oversupply of chips will take place in 2023. Another 36% of executives believe that the oversupply will take place between 2024 and 2026. The remaining 9% believe that there will be no oversupply in the next four years as demand will be able to keep pace.  The automotive, industrial, civil, and military aerospace industries are expected to be demand generators for the semiconductor industry. According to Gartner, the end market demand for semiconductors from the automotive industry is set to experience a YoY growth of 13.8% in 2023 to total revenue of $76.9 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, KPMG anticipates the automotive sector to generate annual revenue of around $200 billion for the semiconductor industry by the middle of the next decade and cross the $250 billion level by 2040.Shifting Demand Patterns In the future, experts believe that the demand for semiconductors will become less reliant on the PC, tablet, and smartphone end markets. Demand is expected to come from diverse and fragmented markets that would be less exposed to any change in consumer spending, like the PC, tablet, and smartphone end markets, and would be more driven by capital outlay by organizations. The diversification of demand is likely to benefit some of the best semiconductor stocks in the industry. To support and strengthen the semiconductor industry, significant initiatives have been introduced in both the United States and Europe. The introduction of the CHIPS Act in the US intends to direct investment of $280 billion toward the semiconductor industry in the next decade. Around $200 billion will be diverted toward research and development (R&amp;D) and commercialization. Furthermore, the US government intends to give a tax credit of $24 billion under this program.

201,b9c1899b-04cd-3d72-8662-acdad1e62c6a,HAS,2023-06-10,The struggling toymaker behind Dungeons & Dragons and Play-Doh is banking on middle-aged shoppers as the ‘heart and soul’ of its business,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/struggling-toymaker-behind-dungeons-dragons-102827531.html,1686306507,STORY,['HAS'],"[Hasbro has over decades become synonymous with anything related to toys and games—whether that’s for families playing Monopoly or for toddlers obsessed with Play-Doh clay. There’s something for everyone, and that’s helped the company achieve its success over the years.But now, as Hasbro faces a challenging time with consumers pulling back on spending, it is having to tweak its strategy to be the go-to games company. And Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks sees opportunities to do that in one key area: among loyal toy-collecting adults.“As they are becoming adults, a lot of people become more intense in their loyalties toward brands nurtured when they were kids,” Cocks told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Friday, referring to the “kidult” category.He added that about 40% of Hasbro’s annual revenue comes from those 18 and older—a number he sees expand to 50% in the next five years.“The heart and soul of our adult fan business is delivering to 30, 40, 50-plusers the toys of their dreams from when they were kids,” Cocks said. He noted that with some popular games, people started early and continued playing well into their middle age.“With Dungeons &amp; Dragons, most people start playing at the age of 11 or 12 and never stop playing even when they are a 49-year-old CEO of a company like me. I still play about once a month,” Cocks said.Kidults are typically aged 12 and above, and account for a majority of the toy industry’s dollar spending, according to market research firm NPD Group. The age group of 18 and older makes up a fast-growing segment—between September 2021 and 2022, this demographic within toy-shoppers grew 19%.“The definition of adulthood has definitely evolved,” Jeremy Padawer, chief brand officer at toy company Jazwares, told CNBC in December. “What it used to mean, to be an adult, was to be a very upstanding, serious member of society. And to do that you had to demonstrate it intellectually, emotionally, in every other single way. Now we feel a lot more free to express our fandom as a part of our adulthood.”Story continuesTough timesDespite the age-defying interest in many of its products, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons maker has not had it easy in recent months.It reported downbeat results for 2022 as inflation and a slowing economy bit into holiday-season spending by Hasbro customers. The company’s revenue fell 9% in 2022, while some of its competitors made big gains. Price increases over the pandemic also impacted demand for toys and games, and the company lost a key licensing deal to Barbie-maker, Mattel. Hasbro laid off 1,000 people earlier this year in a cost-cutting effort after some parts of its digital business underperformed in 2022.“We lost sight of play, the center pillar of Hasbro, and underinvested in our core toy business. Because of that, our innovation flywheel wasn’t spinning as fast as our competition’s,” Cocks told the Journal, adding that the loss of market share within the toy industry was among Hasbro’s biggest challenges. The toy giant also needs to find a way to set itself apart from companies like Mattel, which could make big profits with the July release of a new Barbie movie amid great fanfare.But Cocks maintains that he is confident Hasbro will capitalize on its existing market and lineup of products to bounce back. Just last month, the toymaker announced a 24-hour streaming channel dedicated to Dungeons &amp; Dragons.“We’ve had a long history of adapting our brands for the way people play—whether it’s a physical toy, a show that people watch, a movie they go to theaters for, or a game,” Cocks said.Hasbro reported strong first-quarter results for the first three months of 2023 after “Magic: The Gathering,” a trading card game, helped lure customers to the company’s products.Hasbro did not immediately return Fortune’s request for comment made outside regular hours of operations.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

As a result, AXP customers can avail the innovative financial solutions provided by Envestnet | Yodlee and utilize American Express account information to smartly manage their personal finances and expenses.Meanwhile, the agreement with Plaid aims to establish a connection between AXP’s customers and the 8,000 plus connected apps and services of Plaid across the digital banking ecosystem. The integration of Plaid’s services with AXP’s Account Financials API is likely to commence in 2023.The underlying motive of both partnerships is to offer American Express customers a seamless access to digital financial tools. At the same time, the company intends to offer its customer base a secure and hassle-free data sharing of account information without the need to disclose confidential credential data with any other party besides AXP.The twin collaborations, with the motive of enhancing digital prowess, are likely to bolster the customer base for American Express owing to the ongoing digitization trend followed in every sphere of life and the significant ease and benefits of the trend.AXP has also conducted significant technology investments in the past to devise a solid digital suite for the benefit of its Card Members. It has also taken care of frauds that often come in handy with digital transactions, with effective fraud prevention services. The facility of a token generation that can be used as a substitute for an American Express card  when it is added to the digital wallet, easier monthly payments with AutoPay, the benefit of breaking up payments into equal monthly installments through Plan It and many more such benefits are results of the tech investments pursued by AXP.Story continuesA day before the partnerships with Envestnet | Yodlee and Plaid were announced, American Express teamed up with a fintech, Bluechain, for imparting the power of centrally managing, paying and reconciling supplier invoices by SME owners through a desktop or mobile. This seamless supplier payment process does not exhaust the time and resources of the business owners that they had to earlier expend on completing manual and time-consuming processes, such as data entry and bookkeeping.Shares of American Express have gained 15.9% year to date, compared with the industry’s 5.1% growth.

Renewable energy is currently Timken’s largest individual end-market sector generating 12% of sales, compared to only 5% in 2018. The global demand for renewable energy is expected to witness a CAGR of around 8% over the next 10 years. The share of electricity generation from renewable is expected to more than double by 2030.Thus, the company is focused on targeted investments in this sector to capitalize on this trend and make it a bigger part of its portfolio in the future.Strategic Acquisitions to Boost PortfolioTimken continues to pursue strategic acquisitions to broaden its portfolio and capabilities across diverse markets, with a focus on bearings, adjacent power transmission products and related services. In 2022, Timken completed the acquisition of Spinea, a technology leader and manufacturer of highly engineered cycloidal reduction gears and actuators.Timken also acquired EnPro Industries' NPO surface-engineering solutions business, GGB Bearing Technology, for $305 million in cash. GGB boasts a portfolio of metal-polymer bearings, serving a wide range of industries.Timken acquired the assets of American Roller Bearing in January 2023, which will augment the company’s market position in engineered bearings. It also completed the acquisition of Nadella Group in April 2023, which will expand its linear motion portfolio in attractive market sectors.Solid Balance Sheet to Aid GrowthTimken is taking actions to enhance liquidity, reduce costs and generate a strong cash flow. The company’s total debt-to-capital ratio was 0.45 as of Mar 31, 2023, and the times interest earned ratio was 7.6. Timken expects free cash flow in 2023 to be around 100% of net income aided by higher earnings and improved working capital.Near-Term ConcernsTimken’s margins have been impacted by higher operating costs. Also, labor shortages and supply-chain constraints are expected to persist and may impair the company’s ability to capture the full opportunity that comes with a strong demand environment.Price PerformanceIn the past year, shares of Timken have gained 40.2% compared with the industry’s 18.8% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Hubbell Incorporated HUBB and Pentair plc PNR.

212,9b272dc0-94bc-3067-a9af-1764861856f4,OXY,2023-06-10,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 56%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-nyse-oxy-120017420.html,1686398417,STORY,['OXY'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Occidental Petroleum's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 5 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockEvery investor in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 56% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Occidental Petroleum, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Occidental Petroleum does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Occidental Petroleum's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Occidental Petroleum is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 25% of shares outstanding. Dodge &amp; Cox is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 6.7% of the company stock.To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 5 shareholders control more than half of the company which implies that this group has considerable sway over the company's decision-making.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Occidental Petroleum Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$144m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 25% of the Occidental Petroleum shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Occidental Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  Occidental Petroleum is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Together, the data presented show the long-term benefits of treatment with CFTR modulators as well as the importance of treating the underlying cause of CF as early in life as possible. Key data presented at this year’s conference are highlighted below.Vertex presented an interim analysis (IA) of a registry-based study of real-world data collected from people with CF and treated with TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), also known in the European Union and in the U.K. as KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor, including over 16,000 people with CF from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) and nearly 3,000 from the German CF Registry. This ongoing five-year post-authorization study (abstract WS16.03) is the largest real-world study of people with CF treated with TRIKAFTA® to date. The IA showed clinically significant disease-modifying benefits for TRIKAFTA®, including improved lung function and a 79% reduction of pulmonary exacerbations in the U.S. and 83% in Germany overall compared to pre-TRIKAFTA® baseline. The rate of death was 72% lower in the U.S. and 82% lower in Germany, the rate of lung transplant was 85% lower in the U.S. and 100% lower in Germany, compared to 2019 (pre-TRIKAFTA®) U.S. CFFPR and German CF Registry populations. No new safety concerns were identified.Story continuesVertex also presented final results of the nearly four-year TRIKAFTA® open-label follow-up study of the Phase 3 pivotal trials in people with CF ages 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (Late Breaking Science; Workshop 15). The results of this study are unprecedented, showing for the first time that treatment with TRIKAFTA® resulted in no decline in lung function over a four-year period.""CFTR modulators markedly improve clinical outcomes of people living with CF as demonstrated in the large and growing quantity of data presented at ECFS this year,"" said Professor Isabelle Fajac, Professor of Physiology, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France. ""The data on TRIKAFTA in particular demonstrate that this medicine improves lung function sustainably and in a real-world setting. It also reduces the risks of pulmonary exacerbation, death and lung transplant, and it is generally well tolerated.""Additional PresentationsOther Vertex presentations at the conference this year include:Abstract EPS6.05 entitled ""A Phase 3b study of the effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) on cough and physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)""Abstract WS05.04 entitled ""Safety and efficacy of ivacaftor (IVA) in children aged 1 to &lt;4 months with cystic fibrosis assessed with an innovative clinical trial design""Late Breaking Science (Workshop 15) abstract entitled ""LONGITUDE: An observational study of the long-term effectiveness of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis using data from the United Kingdom Cystic Fibrosis Registry""Abstract WS16.02 entitled ""Real-world (RW) clinical effectiveness of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) in children with cystic fibrosis aged 6-11 years: interim results from the HELIO study""Abstract P117 entitled ""A longitudinal study on the impact of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment on quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis in the real world""Abstract P118 entitled ""Real-world impact of ELX/TEZ/IVA on quality of life of children with CF aged 6-11 years and primary caregivers in the UK: MAGNIFY, a prospective, observational, noninterventional study""Abstract WS05.03 entitled ""A Phase 3b study of the effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) on glucose tolerance in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and abnormal glucose metabolism""Abstract WS16.04 entitled ""Benefits of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) initiation in children with CF aged 2 through 5 years: Interim results from an ongoing registry-based study""Abstract WS16.05 entitled ""Long-Term Impact of Ivacaftor (IVA) in People with Cystic Fibrosis in Ireland""Late Breaking Science (Workshop 15) abstract entitled ""Effects of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) treatment on markers of inflammation in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)""About Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 88,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the early 30s.About TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and this can prevent the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface and functioning properly. TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) is an oral medicine designed to increase the quantity and function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. Elexacaftor and tezacaftor work together to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.U.S. INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)TRIKAFTA is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or another mutation that is responsive to treatment with TRIKAFTA. Patients should talk to their doctor to learn if they have an indicated CF gene mutation. It is not known if TRIKAFTA is safe and effective in children under 2 years of age.Before taking TRIKAFTA, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they: have kidney problems, have or have had liver problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant because it is not known if TRIKAFTA will harm an unborn baby, or are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed because it is not known if TRIKAFTA passes into breast milk.Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.TRIKAFTA may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how TRIKAFTA works. The dose of TRIKAFTA may need to be adjusted when taken with certain medicines. Patients should ask their doctor or pharmacist for a list of these medicines if they are not sure.Patients should especially tell their doctor if they take: antibiotics such as rifampin or rifabutin; seizure medicines such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin; St. John’s wort; antifungal medicines including ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole; antibiotics including telithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin.Patients should avoid food or drink that contains grapefruit while they are taking TRIKAFTA.TRIKAFTA can cause serious side effects, including:Liver damage and worsening of liver function in people with severe liver disease that can be serious and may require transplantation. Liver damage has also happened in people without liver disease.High liver enzymes in the blood, which is a common side effect in people treated with TRIKAFTA. These can be serious and may be a sign of liver injury. The patient’s doctor will do blood tests to check their liver before they start TRIKAFTA, every 3 months during the first year of taking TRIKAFTA, and every year while taking TRIKAFTA. Patients should call their doctor right away if they have any of the following symptoms of liver problems: pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area; yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes; loss of appetite; nausea or vomiting; dark, amber-colored urine.Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) has been noted in some children and adolescents treated with TRIKAFTA. If the patient is a child or adolescent, their doctor should perform eye examinations before and during treatment with TRIKAFTA to look for cataracts.The most common side effects of TRIKAFTA include headache, upper respiratory tract infection (common cold) including stuffy and runny nose, stomach (abdominal) pain, diarrhea, rash, increase in liver enzymes, increase in a certain blood enzyme called creatine phosphokinase, flu (influenza), inflamed sinuses, and increase in blood bilirubin.Patients should tell their doctor if they have any side effect that bothers them or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of TRIKAFTA. For more information, patients should ask their doctor or pharmacist.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Vertex Pharmaceuticals'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:23% = US$3.3b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 23% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has an impressive ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 24%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 23% net income growth seen by Vertex Pharmaceuticals was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Vertex Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 33% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for VRTX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

This puts Petrobras in an enviable position to maintain an impressive production growth profile for years to come. Meanwhile, the company’s ambitious divestment plans appear to be working well as far as deleveraging is concerned.Having said all of this, the fact that Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras is still reeling under huge debt burden cannot be overlooked. The firm is also having to deal with years of mismanagement and corruption, while investors remain wary of the risk of political interference.

226,2bece495-d512-3d19-8516-5a759e5227ff,KO,2023-06-10,10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-recession-proof-stocks-133428504.html,1686317668,STORY,"['SJM', 'DG', 'KO', 'GOLD', 'SRE', 'PG', 'STZ', 'ABT']","[In this article, we will be looking at the 10 best recession-proof stocks to buy now. To skip our detailed analysis on the latest probability of recession, click to see 5 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy Now.Is A Recession On The Horizon?On June 6, CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' hosted Jan Hatzius, the Chief Economist and Head of Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, who had been brought in after Goldman lowered the US recession probability multiple put forth by the bank. The cut brought the multiple down by 10%, from 35% to 25%. Hatzius claimed that there were two reasons behind this move. First, he explained that prior to the Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, Goldman Sachs' recession multiple had been 25%. It was only increased because of the expected impact of the banking crisis on the US economy, and while professionals at Goldman still felt that the crisis would continue to impact the economy, they can size it at around ""40 basis points off-of growth,"" in Hatzius' words. According to Hatzius, this was the main reason behind Goldman's decision to lower the recession probability multiple in June. He added that a secondary reason behind the move was the fact that the debt ceiling deal had had little impact on American fiscal policy.While the above report seems to offer a cause for celebration, as the interview with Hatzius shows, this wasn't the whole story. Bulls in the market today are optimistic about the inflationary environment in the US, believing that the Federal Reserve will not be raising any more rates any time soon. At the same time, the bears are in opposition, believing that the Fed may have some more rate hikes up its sleeve even now. When Hatzius was asked about his opinion on this conundrum, he revealed that he was being cautiously optimistic about potential rate hikes. He did add that one of the concessions made by professionals over at Goldman before they lowered their recession probability multiple was that there would likely be another rate hike. However, Hatzius sees this hike coming in July, giving the economy some room to breathe through June.Story continuesIndustries To Pick In The Event Of A RecessionWhile Hatzius and others at Goldman Sachs seem to be more optimistic on the matter of whether the US will see a recession in 2023 or not, there are many others who cannot help but think otherwise. For those individuals, investing in recession-proof stocks now can be vital. While deciding which stocks would count as 'recession-proof,' many investors can get confused. To avoid this, the best way to begin a search for these stocks is to learn from the past. Our article on stocks that did well during the 2008 financial crisis can be a helpful place to start, as it takes the reader through a range of stocks in various industries that have proven their resilience in the face of a recession already. They include top-tier companies similar to Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), among many others. The examples of these three companies can give you a hint as to which industries have historically done well during a recession. Consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, streaming, discount store, and even fast food stocks all have a record of positive performance during recessions. Commodities like gold are yet another category of recession-proof stocks because when all else fails, gold stays up.While it is definitely a good idea to be prepared for anything the economy might throw at you, it's also important to keep in mind what professionals in the financial world are talking about. Bearish sentiment is now being beaten back by the bulls who see a more positive economic future on the horizon. In an earlier interview on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street,' for instance, Goldman's Hatzius noted that the US jobs report from May had signaled strength and resilience as far as the economy was concerned. He believed that in light of the strong progress demonstrated by the labor markets through May, there was enough cause for believing that the US economy was far from being on the brink of a recession. According to CNBC, the May jobs report boasted the 29th straight month of growth for the labor market. If this optimism pays off, the US economy may be able to make it through 2023 without a recession, but no one can tell for sure if this will be the case.Considering the rampant insecurity and uncertainty relating to the economy today, we have compiled a list of some of the best recession-proof stocks to invest in today. As mentioned above, while professionals like Hatzius feel inclined to think positively, the paranoia resounding throughout the US markets cannot be countered just yet, making now the perfect time to begin considering safe investments.10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowSource:PixabayOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked, to pick the most popular recession-proof stocks among smart money investors.

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.The ratings reflect NGIC’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).The ratings also reflect NGIC’s strategic role as the captive insurance company of Waste Management, Inc. (WM) [NYSE: WM], one of the leading providers of comprehensive waste management environmental services in North America. As a strategic and integral part of WM’s ERM program, the parent wholly funded the captive’s capitalization in the form of a demand note that generates net investment income to augment surplus annually. Further supplements have been provided in form of letters of credit as changes in exposures warrant. NGIC benefits from WM’s robust risk management strategies, which enable it to support a portion of WM’s financial assurance program efficiently and appropriately.NGIC’s surplus growth is organic and steady as the company has been able to enhance its profitability over the past five years by significantly reducing its underwriting expenses. It has not had any losses in the program; however, NGIC has an expense ratio that is higher than others in the surplus lines composite due to the nature of the financial assurance line of business and expenses focused on its comprehensive risk mitigation.Positive rating action could occur if a sustained positive trend in balance sheet strength continues in the near term. Negative rating action could occur if AM Best's perception of the parent’s ability and willingness to support the captive changes significantly. Negative rating impact also could occur if the company’s balance sheet strength or risk-based capitalization weakens materially to a level that does not support its risks.Story continuesAM Best remains the leading rating agency of alternative risk transfer entities, with more than 200 such vehicles rated in the United States and throughout the world.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Whirlpool The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$567.2mUS$944.9mUS$1.11bUS$1.05bUS$1.33bUS$1.43bUS$1.52bUS$1.59bUS$1.66bUS$1.71bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 7.60%Est @ 5.96%Est @ 4.80%Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.43% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 13% US$504US$746US$781US$657US$739US$707US$666US$620US$573US$527(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.5bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 13%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (13%– 2.1%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 13%)10= US$5.2bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$12b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$144, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Whirlpool as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 13%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.751. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for WhirlpoolStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Durables market.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company is unprofitable.Revenue is forecast to decrease over the next 2 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Whirlpool, there are three additional items you should further research:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for Whirlpool (1 is significant!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does WHR's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

To skip our detailed analysis on the latest probability of recession, click to see 5 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy Now.Is A Recession On The Horizon?On June 6, CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' hosted Jan Hatzius, the Chief Economist and Head of Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, who had been brought in after Goldman lowered the US recession probability multiple put forth by the bank. The cut brought the multiple down by 10%, from 35% to 25%. Hatzius claimed that there were two reasons behind this move. First, he explained that prior to the Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, Goldman Sachs' recession multiple had been 25%. It was only increased because of the expected impact of the banking crisis on the US economy, and while professionals at Goldman still felt that the crisis would continue to impact the economy, they can size it at around ""40 basis points off-of growth,"" in Hatzius' words. According to Hatzius, this was the main reason behind Goldman's decision to lower the recession probability multiple in June. He added that a secondary reason behind the move was the fact that the debt ceiling deal had had little impact on American fiscal policy.While the above report seems to offer a cause for celebration, as the interview with Hatzius shows, this wasn't the whole story. Bulls in the market today are optimistic about the inflationary environment in the US, believing that the Federal Reserve will not be raising any more rates any time soon. At the same time, the bears are in opposition, believing that the Fed may have some more rate hikes up its sleeve even now. When Hatzius was asked about his opinion on this conundrum, he revealed that he was being cautiously optimistic about potential rate hikes. He did add that one of the concessions made by professionals over at Goldman before they lowered their recession probability multiple was that there would likely be another rate hike. However, Hatzius sees this hike coming in July, giving the economy some room to breathe through June.Story continuesIndustries To Pick In The Event Of A RecessionWhile Hatzius and others at Goldman Sachs seem to be more optimistic on the matter of whether the US will see a recession in 2023 or not, there are many others who cannot help but think otherwise. For those individuals, investing in recession-proof stocks now can be vital. While deciding which stocks would count as 'recession-proof,' many investors can get confused. To avoid this, the best way to begin a search for these stocks is to learn from the past. Our article on stocks that did well during the 2008 financial crisis can be a helpful place to start, as it takes the reader through a range of stocks in various industries that have proven their resilience in the face of a recession already. They include top-tier companies similar to Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), among many others. The examples of these three companies can give you a hint as to which industries have historically done well during a recession. Consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, streaming, discount store, and even fast food stocks all have a record of positive performance during recessions. Commodities like gold are yet another category of recession-proof stocks because when all else fails, gold stays up.While it is definitely a good idea to be prepared for anything the economy might throw at you, it's also important to keep in mind what professionals in the financial world are talking about. Bearish sentiment is now being beaten back by the bulls who see a more positive economic future on the horizon. In an earlier interview on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street,' for instance, Goldman's Hatzius noted that the US jobs report from May had signaled strength and resilience as far as the economy was concerned. He believed that in light of the strong progress demonstrated by the labor markets through May, there was enough cause for believing that the US economy was far from being on the brink of a recession. According to CNBC, the May jobs report boasted the 29th straight month of growth for the labor market. If this optimism pays off, the US economy may be able to make it through 2023 without a recession, but no one can tell for sure if this will be the case.Considering the rampant insecurity and uncertainty relating to the economy today, we have compiled a list of some of the best recession-proof stocks to invest in today. As mentioned above, while professionals like Hatzius feel inclined to think positively, the paranoia resounding throughout the US markets cannot be countered just yet, making now the perfect time to begin considering safe investments.10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowSource:PixabayOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked, to pick the most popular recession-proof stocks among smart money investors.

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Vulcan Materials (VMC), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Vulcan Materials currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if VMC is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this construction materials company holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor VMC, shares are up 3.43% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.83% compares favorably with the industry's 0.9% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Vulcan Materials have risen 24.05%, and are up 28% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 7.94% and 5.97%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to VMC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. VMC is currently averaging 729,022 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with VMC.Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost VMC's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.90 to $6.45 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 10 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that VMC is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Vulcan Materials on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moreover, the company has a strong VGM Score of A, backed by a Value Score of A and a Growth Score of B.Let us discuss the growth factors broadly.Factors Favoring Taylor MorrisonTaylor Morrison’s focus on to-be-built and spec homes is resulting in increased growth momentum despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. The company’s favorable mix of 60% spec home and 40% to-be-built since the past few quarters have added to the uptrend.Since the fourth quarter of 2022, to-be-built margins have exceeded spec home margins due to a high-margin option and a lot of premium revenues earned from the to-be-built strategy, wherein buyers customize their homes. In the first quarter of 2023, the company’s to-be-built margins were up by about 480 basis points (bps) year over year.TMHC’s persistent focus on operational enhancements has resulted in increased service delivery efficiencies along with a wide range of its portfolio. These factors eventually lead to increased demand and a competitive edge over its peers. The company’s geographical spread of its operating segments ensures facilitating the optimization of purchases, construction and sale procedures, innovation in the design and quality of its products and improving customer experience.Also, Taylor Morrison’s digital initiatives add to its growth trend. In October 2022, the company launched the To-Be-Built 2.0 Reservation System, an upgraded version of the To-Be-Built 1.0 Reservation System launched in March 2021. The new system involves an interactive visualizer, providing customers with the experience of building a home online.

239,eab7b3ca-a4fc-3ba0-9d14-735020adc3cd,GE,2023-06-10,We Think General Electric (NYSE:GE) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-general-electric-nyse-ge-130028235.html,1686315628,STORY,['GE'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric What Is General Electric's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that General Electric had debt of US$22.4b at the end of March 2023, a reduction from US$33.6b over a year. However, it does have US$22.4b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$6.00m.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At General Electric's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that General Electric had liabilities of US$48.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$83.5b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$22.4b and US$16.2b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$93.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$115.5b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry. But either way, General Electric has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.General Electric's net debt to EBITDA ratio is very low, at 0.00069, suggesting the debt is only trivial. But EBIT was only 6.3 times the interest expense last year, so the borrowing is clearly weighing on the business somewhat. Better yet, General Electric grew its EBIT by 138% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine General Electric's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last two years, General Electric generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 97% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewThe good news is that General Electric's demonstrated ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its level of total liabilities. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like General Electric is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example General Electric has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is potentially serious)  we think you should know about.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

This, coupled with the company’s shareholder-friendly policies, primarily drove its shares up 26.6% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s 4.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchContinued recovery in the commercial market is driving growth of GE’s Aerospace segment. Robust consumer demand is boosting orders in the segment. While orders climbed 14% in the first quarter of 2023, revenues increased 25%. Substantial LEAP engine deliveries and shop visit growth drove orders and revenues in the segment.After months of softness, a rebound in demand at the Power segment augurs well for General Electric. Strength in GE Gas Power heavy-duty gas turbine transactional services and aero derivatives is aiding the Power segment. The acquisition of Nexus Controls (April 2023), which allows the creation of a single, full-service controls business line for further development of GE’s proprietary Mark Vle controls systems platform, should bolster the Power segment’s growth. The acquisition is aligned with GE’s commitment to invest in leading controls technology and expertise to enhance customer experience.With higher equipment demand at Grid and Onshore Wind in North America, signs of progress in GE’s Renewable Energy segment are encouraging.General Electric’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging. In the first quarter of 2023, the company paid dividends of $203 million and repurchased 3.2 million shares for $0.3 billion.Will the Uptrend in Shares Continue?Continued momentum in the commercial aerospace aftermarket driven by an improvement in passenger traffic supports General Electric’s growth going forward. GE expects the Power segment to continue to recover on strength in Gas Power services.  The company expects low single-digit revenue growth for the segment in 2023.Improving supply chains and strength across key end markets are expected to fuel General Electric’s growth. GE’s bullish guidance for 2023 highlights the buoyant scenario ahead of the company. With market demand remaining strong, General Electric has raised its earnings guidance for 2023.

241,a4c3872f-e072-3846-ae54-51b03f10e384,UNH,2023-06-10,4 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes as Economic Worries Worsen,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-dividend-hikes-131900314.html,1686316740,STORY,"['JCI', 'UNH', 'TTE', 'CASY', '^GSPC']","[Wall Street has been going through a turbulent phase over the past couple of months despite starting the year on a high. Although all three major indexes closed higher last week, the volatility continues over growing concerns of the economy slipping into a recession later this year.The Nasdaq had an impressive May, ending 5.8% higher, driven by a rally in tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 also ended 0.2% higher but the Dow suffered throughout the month, ending 3.5% down.This is because stocks are struggling for direction as market participants have so far been unable to gauge the Fed’s future interest rate hike path.Investors are now looking forward to the Fed’s next policy meeting scheduled for this month. Expectations are high that the Fed might finally pause hiking interest rates in this meeting but the picture isn’t clear yet. The central bank has already hiked interest rates on 10 consecutive occasions, with interest rates currently in the range of 5.00-5.25% range.Inflation has lately started showing signs of easing but it is still a lot higher than the Fed’s target range of 2%. There are multiple other concerns that have been unsettling stocks. Although the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in May, the highest in several years, the labor market continues to be resilient.According to the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm payrolls increased by 339,000 in May against expectations of 190,000. The strong labor market has raised concerns that the Fed might be forced to continue with its aggressive interest rate hike stance.Besides, market participants are also closely watching the global economy, which has further raised concerns. On Jun 8, the Eurozone slipped into recession after the 20-nation block’s economy declined 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023, after contracting in the final quarter of 2022.Last month, Germany said that its economy entered recession after shrinking 0.3% between January and March. Also, China, which is considered the global manufacturing hub, has been witnessing a contraction in economic activity. Factory activity shrunk at the fastest pace in the first five months of the year in China, while service activity has advanced at its slowest pace in the past four months.Story continuesStocks in FocusGiven this situation, betting on dividend-paying stocks would be a wise decision.

HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH.Industry: HMOsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2105670/5-hmo-industry-stocks-to-watch-as-technology-expenses-take-a-toll?art_rec=home-home-investment_ideas_stocks-ID07-txt-21056705 HMO Industry Stocks to Watch as Technology Expenses Take a TollThe U.S. health insurance industry, referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is expected to gain on the back of growing premiums and an expanding customer base, thanks to the well-performing Government business. The industry players have an active merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy in place. Though technology investments are made to boost operational efficiencies, these often escalate costs for industry players. Shortage of medical personnel across the United States is a concern. Despite the challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, The Cigna Group, Humana Inc., Centene Corporation and Molina Healthcare, Inc. appear well-placed to counter the industry headwinds.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO Industry A High Technology Expense Level: Telehealth services were prevalent in the United States prior to the COVID-19 pandemic but their usage was not as widespread as it has been since the onset of the pandemic. Per a report by Grand View Research, the global telehealth market is anticipated to witness a 24% CAGR over the 2023-2030 period. This impressive growth forecast indicates that demand for digital healthcare services will continue to be high. HMO players are therefore compelled to undertake technology investments to build telehealth platforms. Needless to say, the platforms fetch a steady revenue stream for industry players and boost their operational efficiencies. But tech investments might escalate costs and erode the margins of health insurers.Shortage of Medical Staff: A dearth in the availability of medical personnel is taking a toll on the efficient functioning of hospitals nationwide. An increase in the number of nurses reaching retirement age, greater life expectancy of the overall population and faculty shortages in nursing schools are some of the factors triggering a scarcity in the nursing workforce. Health insurers collaborate with hospitals, physicians and other facilities to offer discounted care access to plan members. Therefore, the effectiveness of services remains a crucial factor behind health plan renewals. A shortage in the nursing workforce can reduce a hospital’s ability to deliver quality care services and indirectly affect the customer base of HMO companies. Healthy membership growth is crucial to the premiums of health insurers.Rising Customer Base: Most of the participants in the HMO space distribute cost-effective health plans through their Government business and upgrade them from time to time. The strength of such plans leads to federal or state contract wins for HMO players.  Plan upgrades as well as contract wins bring in more customers for the industry participants and provide an impetus to premiums. Also, these provide them an opportunity to serve different underserved U.S. communities and bolster their geographic footprint. Given an aging U.S. population, the solid demand for Medicare plans (meant for 65 years and above), which form part of the abovementioned Government business, is expected to continue.Active M&amp;A Moves: An active M&amp;A strategy offers an opportunity for the industry players to advance their capabilities, enter new regions, delve deeper into existing ones and grow their customer base. The HMO stocks gain from diversification benefits that result from an active pursuit of M&amp;A deals and attain a competitive edge over industry peers. Though interest rates were increased aggressively by the Fed in order to tame inflation, the percentage of increase seems to have somewhat slowed down. This, in turn, is likely to bring down borrowing costs, making it easier for companies to opt for loans to finance M&amp;A deals and avoid complete exhaustion of cash reserves. According to Tom Miles and Brian Healy, Co-Heads of Americas M&amp;A at Morgan Stanley, the pace of such deals is likely to pick up in the second half of 2023 and beyond.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #181, which places it in the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth looking at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Vs. Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Medical sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has gained 1.5% against the Medical sector’s decline of 7.5%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 7% in a year.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 17.25X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.03X and the sector’s 22.32X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.49X and as low as 12.93X, with the median being at 17.69X, as the chart below shows.5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe present five stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Considering the current industry scenario, it might be prudent for investors to retain these stocks in their portfolio, as these are well-placed to generate growth in the long haul.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.UnitedHealth Group: Based in Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group benefits from its solid segmental performance. While a strong Government business empowers the health insurer to gain more Medicare and Medicaid customers, the Optum unit gains on buyouts and utilization of advanced technology and market-leading health analytics. A robust telehealth services suite developed through significant investments enables UNH to deliver virtual healthcare services effectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.97 per share, indicating a 12.5% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 12.6% growth from the year-ago actual. UNH’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 4.04%. Its shares have gained 3.7% in the past three months.Cigna: This Connecticut-based health insurer continues to benefit from the strength exhibited by its two growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. While a solid specialty pharmacy services suite drives the growth of the Evernorth platform, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from a growing customer base within its U.S. Government and U.S. Commercial businesses. New collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems strengthen the capabilities of the health insurer.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.81 per share, implying 6.6% growth from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests a 4.6% improvement from the year-ago actual. CI’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 6.56%. Even though its shares have declined 3.8% in the past three months, solid fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Humana: Headquartered in Kentucky, Humana is driven by higher premiums and an expanding customer base across its Medicaid and Medicare businesses. The health insurer teams up with well-reputed organizations to launch new plans or upgrade features within the existing ones. The strength of such plans leads to numerous contract wins and renewed agreements for Humana from various federal or state authorities. A series of acquisitions undertaken over the years, including those of Family Physicians Group, iCare and Inclusa, has diversified income streams and extended the nationwide presence of HUM.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humana’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $28.25 per share, indicating a 11.9% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 10% growth from the year-ago actual. HUM’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 8.87%. Its shares have rallied 3.7% in the past three months.Centene: Based in Missouri, Centene benefits from a strong Managed Care business resulting from growth in Medicaid membership and the Medicare business, and several contract wins. It follows an inorganic growth route, which, in turn, bolsters its capabilities and provides an opportunity to boost membership. A well-diversified healthcare suite and solid nationwide presence have fetched numerous contract wins, and deal renewals for CNC. The health insurer also resorts to divestitures for intensifying focus on growing its core Managed Care business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.43 per share, which implies a rise of 11.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 0.7% growth from the year-ago actual. CNC’s earnings outpaced estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark twice, the average being 0.59%. Its shares have rallied 3.3% in the past three months.Molina Healthcare: This California-based health insurer benefits from higher premium revenues and a growing customer base, resulting from well-devised Medicare and Medicaid plans. Several contract wins and renewals are likely to drive membership growth in the days ahead. Frequent acquisitions pursued by MOH have solidified its capabilities and resulted in an extensive nationwide foothold. It also resorts to tactical cost-cutting measures that aid margins.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molina Healthcare’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $20.14 per share, indicating a 12.4% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues hints at a 3.3% improvement from the year-ago actual. MOH’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 5.42%.

To skip our detailed analysis on the latest probability of recession, click to see 5 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy Now.Is A Recession On The Horizon?On June 6, CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' hosted Jan Hatzius, the Chief Economist and Head of Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, who had been brought in after Goldman lowered the US recession probability multiple put forth by the bank. The cut brought the multiple down by 10%, from 35% to 25%. Hatzius claimed that there were two reasons behind this move. First, he explained that prior to the Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, Goldman Sachs' recession multiple had been 25%. It was only increased because of the expected impact of the banking crisis on the US economy, and while professionals at Goldman still felt that the crisis would continue to impact the economy, they can size it at around ""40 basis points off-of growth,"" in Hatzius' words. According to Hatzius, this was the main reason behind Goldman's decision to lower the recession probability multiple in June. He added that a secondary reason behind the move was the fact that the debt ceiling deal had had little impact on American fiscal policy.While the above report seems to offer a cause for celebration, as the interview with Hatzius shows, this wasn't the whole story. Bulls in the market today are optimistic about the inflationary environment in the US, believing that the Federal Reserve will not be raising any more rates any time soon. At the same time, the bears are in opposition, believing that the Fed may have some more rate hikes up its sleeve even now. When Hatzius was asked about his opinion on this conundrum, he revealed that he was being cautiously optimistic about potential rate hikes. He did add that one of the concessions made by professionals over at Goldman before they lowered their recession probability multiple was that there would likely be another rate hike. However, Hatzius sees this hike coming in July, giving the economy some room to breathe through June.Story continuesIndustries To Pick In The Event Of A RecessionWhile Hatzius and others at Goldman Sachs seem to be more optimistic on the matter of whether the US will see a recession in 2023 or not, there are many others who cannot help but think otherwise. For those individuals, investing in recession-proof stocks now can be vital. While deciding which stocks would count as 'recession-proof,' many investors can get confused. To avoid this, the best way to begin a search for these stocks is to learn from the past. Our article on stocks that did well during the 2008 financial crisis can be a helpful place to start, as it takes the reader through a range of stocks in various industries that have proven their resilience in the face of a recession already. They include top-tier companies similar to Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), among many others. The examples of these three companies can give you a hint as to which industries have historically done well during a recession. Consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, streaming, discount store, and even fast food stocks all have a record of positive performance during recessions. Commodities like gold are yet another category of recession-proof stocks because when all else fails, gold stays up.While it is definitely a good idea to be prepared for anything the economy might throw at you, it's also important to keep in mind what professionals in the financial world are talking about. Bearish sentiment is now being beaten back by the bulls who see a more positive economic future on the horizon. In an earlier interview on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street,' for instance, Goldman's Hatzius noted that the US jobs report from May had signaled strength and resilience as far as the economy was concerned. He believed that in light of the strong progress demonstrated by the labor markets through May, there was enough cause for believing that the US economy was far from being on the brink of a recession. According to CNBC, the May jobs report boasted the 29th straight month of growth for the labor market. If this optimism pays off, the US economy may be able to make it through 2023 without a recession, but no one can tell for sure if this will be the case.Considering the rampant insecurity and uncertainty relating to the economy today, we have compiled a list of some of the best recession-proof stocks to invest in today. As mentioned above, while professionals like Hatzius feel inclined to think positively, the paranoia resounding throughout the US markets cannot be countered just yet, making now the perfect time to begin considering safe investments.10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy NowSource:PixabayOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked, to pick the most popular recession-proof stocks among smart money investors.

According to PwC, while companies and their employees are determining their preferred work arrangements, some firms are choosing to retain their office spaces as a precautionary measure or due to lease obligations. However, an increasing number of companies are downsizing or opting not to renew expiring leases. Consequently, vacancy rates in the office sector continue to rise gradually, which is in contrast to other major property sectors. Additionally, many tenants are resorting to subletting their office spaces until their leases expire. On the other hand, occupancy levels for logistics real estate in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are currently at or near all-time highs. There are also positive indications suggesting that the retail sector is experiencing a revival. Investment managers interviewed by PwC highlighted the robust operational performance of their retail portfolios in the United States and Europe. This upward trend extends beyond the more resilient sub-sectors such as convenience stores, grocery stores, and retail parks. Selected shopping centers are demonstrating strong performance in the market as well. Don't Miss: 20 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USAThe commercial real estate sector continues to face significant economic uncertainty for the remainder of 2023, with several key factors impacting its future. These factors include the uncertain interest rate environment and the evolving nature of office spaces. Over the period from March 2022 to May 2023, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates consistently for ten consecutive times. However, according to JPMorgan, multifamily properties continue to thrive. While the rate of rent increases has declined, the national vacancy rate for multifamily properties was 4.5% at the end of 2022. Vacancy rates vary across different metro areas, but the median vacancy rate in the country as of April stands at 3.9%. Story continuesFurthermore, JPMorgan noted that despite e-commerce comprising around 15% of retail, not all consumer needs can be met online. Certain services, like nail salons, barbershops, and sports bars, still require in-person visits. The industrial sector has experienced significant growth driven by e-commerce and the on-demand economy as well. The vacancy rate for distribution and warehouse spaces hit a record low of 4.1% in the second half of 2022, but it increased slightly to 4.2% in the first quarter of 2023. While demand for office space has been impacted by remote and hybrid work models, A-class office properties continue to perform well, especially those with leases lasting 10 years or more, which may be able to weather market corrections. On the other hand, B- and C-class office buildings, particularly those with shorter leases in non-prime locations, face challenges as the workplace evolves. The real estate industry is undergoing significant changes driven by technology advancements and increased capital. FortuneBuilders observed that online property listing platforms, smartphone apps, virtual reality, and blockchain technology are expected to have a profound impact on real estate transactions. Buyers and renters now have access to online platforms, leading to more informed property searches. Moreover, blockchain technology is likely to be utilized for legal components of transactions, such as transferring deeds and sharing important documents, increasing trust and reducing intermediaries. Virtual reality will also gain popularity, allowing potential buyers to virtually tour properties without physically visiting them. Meanwhile, millennials are entering the real estate market with a preference for suburban areas and walkable neighborhoods, presenting new opportunities for investors in mixed-use and retail spaces. Overall, the future of real estate will be shaped by technological advancements and shifting buyer preferences.In this exciting real estate landscape, some of the best commercial stocks to invest in include CBRE Group, Inc.

However, as the largest public office REIT, it operates in a challenging space due to high capital expenditure needs, the ease of adding new supply and tenant leverage. BXP is also concentrated in large coastal markets that have high taxes and burdensome regulations, and subsequently have seen population outflows. We believe the combination of a tough business and a marginally worse environment given the rising acceptance of at-home work will be challenging over the long term for BXP.”7.

(NYSE:RHP) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Ryman Hospitality is a well-run, resiliently positioned REIT that has carved out a core competency in the group-travel business. The company owns 5 of the 10 largest convention-oriented resorts under the Gaylord Hotel brand, and it has a small entertainment business which owns iconic assets like the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium. We believe the group-travel business will normalize and potentially be of heightened importance given the increase in remote work. Pandemic-related industry-wide disruptions coupled with the inflationary dynamic in construction should result in minimal new industry capacity over the next five years, favoring Ryman’s portfolio of assets.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy12 Cities Where Home Prices are Going Up Right Now Disclosure: None. 10 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy Now.The best home builder stocks to buy now, which includes names like PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM), D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), have been on a roll over the past several months, with many companies in the space trading up by 40% to 80% from their October lows, when sentiment towards the housing industry was at a low point.That has investors wondering if the housing stock market today, including some of the 10 Best Commercial Real Estate Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds, is due for a correction in the short-term. Signs as to the strength of the current market are somewhat mixed.The Pending Home Sales Index fell by 5.2% in March, with pending transactions declining by 23.2% during the month from a year earlier. NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun noted that the lack of housing inventory has been a boon for housing prices, 28% of which are selling above their listing prices, but has otherwise proven to be a major impediment to sales.Real estate investors are also taking a breather from the market according to Redfin, as their home purchases declined by 48.6% in the first quarter, the biggest year-over-year decline the firm has ever recorded. Redfin cited higher interest rates and sliding rent prices as some of the reasons why investors aren’t nearly as bullish on the market at the moment. The firm recently noted that homebuying demand also dropped across the board during the four-week period ended May 25, sliding by 17.4% year-over-year.Luxury homebuilders are some of the most coveted housing stocks to buy, but even they’re not immune to the effects of rising interest rates, as luxury home prices declined in Q1 for the first time since the financial crisis according to data gathered from 46 leading markets by real estate tracking firm Knight Frank. After rising by 3% in the final quarter of last year, luxury home prices slipped by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2023. The price declines come on the heels of luxury home sales sinking by 38% during the three-month period ended November 30 according to Redfin, the largest drop on record.Story continuesIf some of that data makes you interested in uncovering some good housing stocks to short, especially given the recent run-up in share prices, then you’re not alone, as the home builder stocks ETF SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) is one of the most heavily shorted ETFs right now, with nearly 12 million of its shares being shorted.Home builder stocks certainly had a rough go in 2022 and rewarded shorts with nice gains, as existing home sales fell for 12 straight months through January 2023, which represented a new record, and potential buyers increasingly backed out of deals. That shaved billions of dollars in value off the 21 Largest Home Builders in USA, which measures home building stocks by market cap.That said, there are undoubtedly some good housing stocks to buy given some of the more encouraging signs in the market, including record low inventory and rising orders. Mortgage rates have also been on the downswing of late, making homes more affordable than they’ve been for a long time.The following housing stocks list showcases the best home builder stocks to buy now according to the select group of hedge funds that are tracked by Insider Monkey’s database. Let’s see which homebuilders the smart money is betting on for favorable long-term returns.11 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Breno Assis on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe following list of the best home builder stocks to buy now is ranked based on hedge fund sentiment as of March 31.

(NYSE:TPH). The number of funds long TPH currently stands at one of its lowest levels in the last four years, with a few funds selling off their stakes in Tri Pointe Homes during Q1.High-end homebuilder Tri Pointe Homes, Inc.

KB Home (NYSE:KBH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 The number of smart money shareholders of KB Home (NYSE:KBH) took a big dip in Q2, as sentiment towards homebuilders began to sour, but it quickly rebounded in the following quarter.

For the fourth quarter, M/I Homes hit record revenue of $1.22 billion and grew its operating margin by 1.4 percentage points to 25.7%.The Miller Value Deep Value Strategy likes the long-term tailwinds for homebuilders like M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO), as revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“During the quarter, our largest positive contributor was M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO), with share prices up in excess of 30%. Homebuilders in general had been under pressure for much of last year due to marketplace concerns on the potential impact from higher mortgage rates and lower housing affordability. However, as mortgage rates pull back the positive demographics and lack of housing supply over the past 10 years provides a very favorable long-term supply/demand picture for the industry that should shorten the current downturn. M/I Homes is nicely diversified covering multiple home-type categories, with properties in valuable local communities in the Midwest and Southeast (#2 in the Jon Burns Real Estate Consulting Submarket Desirability Index). M/I Homes’ attractive asset base, strong balance sheet and ongoing valuation discount to peers should provide an attractive long-term reward/risk investment opportunity.”6.

The Labor Department stated that employers added 339,000 new jobs in May, much higher than expected. Moreover, U.S. regional bank stocks are also moving north owing to expectations of a pause in interest rate hikes.Investors would do well to take advantage of the rosy scenario by focusing on broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines, Bread Financial, American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Holdings, Boise Cascade Company and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.Here’s Why Broker-Advice Needs to be FollowedBrokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations.As brokers often directly communicate with the top brass, they gain an in-depth understanding of what is happening in a particular company. Therefore, the question of their action being arbitrary does not arise. In fact, a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock.A rating upgrade often leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade. In view of the above attributes, broker action should be relied on by individual investors, in their quest to form a winning portfolio of stocks.Story continuesFormulating a Winning PortfolioWe have designed a screener to arrive at stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks. However, considering only these factors does not make our strategy foolproof as the top line has not been considered.Actually, according to many market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance. To address top-line concerns, we have included the price/sales ratio in our screener which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX.

In keeping with the growing need to ensure mental and emotional health, this year, Aflac's donation directly supports the Center's 35-person Family Support Team, which includes social workers, child life specialists, non-denominational chaplains and music therapists who work in tandem with medical staff to provide therapeutic activities, positive distractions and social support for both patients and families. Family support services are often neglected, leaving hospitals dependent on donations to continue these valuable programs. Aflac is proud and pleased to fill this gap.The Piedmont Columbus Mobile UnitAflac, based in Columbus, Georgia, is also having an impact in communities throughout the nation. One example is a recent donation to Piedmont Columbus Foundation to fund their Mobile Unit, which provides high quality health care to underserved and indigent populations throughout Columbus, a midsized city in western Georgia. This is Aflac's third year as principal sponsor of the program.The Piedmont Columbus Mobile Unit clinical team, consisting of a family practice resident, Pharmacy resident, registered nurse, social worker and medical student, conducts weekly clinics and provide medical care, immunizations and health education in 13 locations throughout the city, such as Safe House, Valley Rescue Mission, Open Door, House of Mercy and more. In 2022, they saw 371 clinic patients, administered 191 COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations, prescribed 277 medications and provided blood pressure screenings to 1,763 individuals.Story continuesThe Mobile Unit also partnered with The Food Mill mobile farmer's market, which Aflac also supports, in providing fresh fruits and vegetables to 306 individuals from August through December. The partnership, which encourages patients to use food as medicine, included free screenings for body weight, BMI and waist circumference, and health education.Chattahoochee RiverkeeperAflac's commitment to our environment led to continued funding of Chattahoochee Riverkeeper (CRK) in 2023, an organization that works to engage and educate the community in stewardship and protection of waterways. The organization's Neighborhood Water Watch and Sweep the Hooch initiatives give Chattahoochee Valley residents the opportunity, tools and resources to help monitor the health of local waterways and fight litter pollution. Last year, 820 pounds of trash were collected by 50 volunteers at one cleanup site at Lakebottom Park. Overall, in 2022, CRK led cleanups that removed 107,532 pounds of trash from the Chattahoochee watershed.And 167 students from local Hollis Hand Elementary, Flat Rock Middle and Eastside Elementary, all Title 1 schools, experienced hands-on learning about the environment through the West Point Lake Floating Classroom, thanks to scholarships provided through Aflac's support of CRK.Employees giving backIn 2022 alone, Aflac employees logged more than 12,000 volunteer hours with organizations and initiatives that are near and dear to them. Whether through fundraising, like the recent fire truck pull in Columbia, South Carolina, to raise funding for childhood cancer, Habitat for Humanity home builds, serving as an ambassador for children's health, or teaming up to support the needs in our communities and beyond - employees across Aflac express care for those in need.Take Ruthie Brown (pictured above, left), Aflac Financial Systems Accountant, and Executive Assistant Lisa Dente (pictured above, right), for example. They recently volunteered for a bed build with the Columbus chapter of Sleep in Heavenly Peace. The organization, which Aflac has supported through donations, provides beds built by volunteers, mattresses and bedding to children who do not have a bed.These are but three of the 78-plus donations made by Aflac in the first quarter of 2023.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Aflac in FocusAflac (AFL) is headquartered in Columbus, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -5.18% since the start of the year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.46%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.56% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.73%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 11.72%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Aflac's payout ratio is 30%, which means it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for AFL for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.81 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 9.01%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Veolia Environnement SA has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while American Water Works has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that VEOEY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than AWK has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.VEOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.54, while AWK has a forward P/E of 30.86. We also note that VEOEY has a PEG ratio of 0.73. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. AWK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.75.Another notable valuation metric for VEOEY is its P/B ratio of 1.41. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AWK has a P/B of 3.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help VEOEY earn a Value grade of A, while AWK has been given a Value grade of D.VEOEY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that VEOEY is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Owing to the many small operators in the industry and a lack of adequate funds, essential infrastructural upgrades and repairs get delayed at times.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments in infrastructure upgrades and the continuation of high-quality customer service. American Water Works is the largest and most geographically diverse publicly traded water and wastewater utility company that continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.American Water Works is quite active in acquiring small units in its service territories as well as  expanding operations.

In that report, analysts expect PepsiCo to post earnings of $1.95 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 4.84%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $21.63 billion, up 6.97% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.30 per share and revenue of $90.66 billion.
