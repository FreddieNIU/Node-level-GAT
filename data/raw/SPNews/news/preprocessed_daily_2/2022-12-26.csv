And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 67% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about U.S. Bancorp. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that U.S. Bancorp does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of U.S. Bancorp, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.5% of shares outstanding. With 6.3% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$108m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over U.S. Bancorp. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 3.3% of U.S. Bancorp stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for U.S. Bancorp that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

1,c7fdd650-e455-3f9e-b2ea-eb7d459b37ac,WMT,2022-12-26,Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Not Lagging Market On Growth Or Pricing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-not-130035610.html,1672059635,STORY,['WMT'],"[When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 14x, you may consider Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 43.2x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Recent times have been advantageous for Walmart as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Walmart peKeen to find out how analysts think Walmart's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Walmart's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 14% last year. Ultimately though, it couldn't turn around the poor performance of the prior period, with EPS shrinking 34% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 33% per year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.3% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Walmart's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Walmart's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.It is also worth noting that we have found 3 warning signs for Walmart that you need to take into consideration.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Walmart. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now. The global economy is expected to grow at a slow pace of approximately 1.6% in 2023 as financial conditions worsen, the winter antagonizes China’s COVID policy, and Europe’s natural gas problems persist. 2022 has been the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 in more than ten years, as rising interest rates, some important corporate earnings misses, and growing concerns about global growth weighed heavily on the stock market. Seasonal investing means that an investment is profitable more than half of the time. Investors become increasingly confident in a seasonal investment as the frequency of profitable trades rises. Seasonal stocks are defined by surging demand during different times of the year. For example, a company focused on designing and manufacturing snowsuits is probably not as active during the summer months, but may enjoy surges in the winter and holiday season. Similarly, air conditioning companies benefit primarily in the summer. Moreover, companies that experience peak demand during tourism months are also considered seasonal stocks, like hotels and resorts. Some of the best seasonal stocks to invest in include The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H). Our Methodology We selected the following seasonal stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 12 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Nowkmichal/Shutterstock.comBest Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now12. Polaris Inc.

(NYSE:HD), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H), Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) is one of the top seasonal stocks to invest in. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors included Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII), BOK Financial and Webster Financial. Polaris, a market leader in off-road vehicles, benefited from a restocking opportunity — inventory at dealers remains depleted, which can serve to offset near-term macroeconomic headwinds. The company also is perceived to be somewhat recession-resilient given its strong financial performance during and after the 2008 financial crisis. We took the opportunity to conclude our investment as we have increased concerns over rising competition, supply chain issues related to sourcing semiconductors and the business’s higher-than-perceived cyclicality.”11.

The Company benefited from pricing actions it took earlier in the year, offsetting rising input cost inflation. An important proof-point we consider when evaluating the competitive advantage of any business is whether margins can be maintained (or expanded), especially during periods of inflation. In addition, Toro continues to see robust demand for its professional and residential products. The Company has a backlog in its professional segment that is at its highest level since the year began, whereas residential products grew +7% on strong year and 2-year comparisons and despite many “home” categories across big-box retailers witnessing declines.The Toro Corporation has an illustrious history stretching back to its founding in 1914. Many of us first encountered The Toro Company in the rite of passage when our parents finally relented in allowing us to cut the grass for the first time when we were barely taller than the lawn mower handle. From the Company’s humble beginning building tractor engines for the Bull Tractor Company in Bloomington, Milwaukee, the Company has methodically grown into the diversified conglomerate of today that possesses industry leading brand awareness, market share, technological prowess, and profitability.We are always enamored with a company’s beginnings, so herewith is the short story of The Toro Corporation’s storied history. The “Toro” name was chosen given its first relationship with The Bull Tractor Company, which according to Company documents was the #1 brand of farm tractors in 1914. Shortly after, in 1919, the Company created the mechanized golf course equipment industry with their invention of The Toro Standard Golf Machine…” (Click here to read the full text)10.

While leisure rates dropped a little in the seasonally slower back-to-school period, this decline was expected and was more than offset by increases in business transient and group bookings. Robust rates across the industry are leading to higher margins, including for Hyatt. Hyatt is using the increased cash flow to buy-in its shares, indicating that it sees value in the stock.”8. Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Mattel, Inc.

Despite store closures in Asia causing -20% regional revenues during the third quarter, Mattel’s consolidated sales still grew 8% due to its strong North American recovery. Barbie sales remain impressive as they have been for years, American Girl is finally returning to growth and Fisher Price is also recovering. The company is successfully passing through inflated costs with higher pricing and without losing volume. Despite the impressive results, the stock trades too low at less than 14x forward earnings, and that is before Mattel begins to monetize its massive non-earning asset Intellectual Property portfolio. Our appraisal of the value grew by more than 30% this year.”7. Lennox International Inc. (NYSE:LII)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Lennox International Inc.

(NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick‘s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Jim Cramer Stock Picks This Week15 Biggest Dry Bulk Shipping Companies in 202210 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

9,76bef9f5-c4be-3eea-9326-c1a192a751bf,CRM,2022-12-26,"Is It Too Late To Consider Buying Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-salesforce-inc-120035225.html,1672056035,STORY,['CRM'],"[Let's talk about the popular Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$165 and falling to the lows of US$128. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Salesforce's current trading price of US$129 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Salesforce’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce Is Salesforce Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Salesforce is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $202.01, but it is currently trading at US$129 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Salesforce’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Salesforce?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Salesforce. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock.

10,6cfd1f1b-5317-381b-9582-fd0130808f39,PCG,2022-12-26,16 Biggest Utility Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-biggest-utility-companies-us-155146433.html,1671983506,STORY,"['DTE', 'ETR', 'PPL', 'PEG', 'DUK', 'AEE', 'FE', 'ES', 'PCGU', 'SO', 'ED', 'NEE-PR']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 biggest utility companies in the U.S. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Utility Companies in the U.S. Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation, especially in Europe. In fact, in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries, all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy, where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.The U.S, on the other hand, saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies, and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However, this does not mean that prices are low, as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America, these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.However, these prices, which end up in massive profits for power producers, do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg, these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This, according to analysts, can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3,700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).Story continuesToday we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), NextEra Energy, Inc.

The stock market will also be closed on Monday, December 26. Your next Market 360 article will be available on Tuesday, December 27. We hope you enjoy the long holiday weekend!With Christmas just a few days away, I want to share with you the best stocks for your portfolio stocking stuffers: energy stocks.You may be wondering, why not tech stocks? After all many are now trading at ultra-low prices, including big tech names like Amazon.com (AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Google Inc. (GOOG), which recently fell to new 52-week lows.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut here’s the reality: Technology and energy stocks’ weighting in the S&amp;P 500 is shifting.Just a year ago, energy accounted for less than 2% of the S&amp;P 500, while technology accounted for about 48%. I predict that energy stocks will account for 30% of the S&amp;P 500 in early 2025, as technology stocks fall to about 32%.So, as the weightings steadily change in the S&amp;P 500, the tracking manager crowd (i.e., closet indexers) will be systematically forced to buy more energy stocks as leading technology stocks falter. In other words, tracking managers will be a net buyer of energy stocks (given their strong earnings momentum) and a net seller of technology stocks.I should also add that, according to FactSet, the energy sector posted the best earnings growth in 2022, with earnings surging 151.7% in 2022.The fact of the matter is oil and natural gas companies will boast the strongest earnings and sales growth for the next several quarters – and positive results should dropkick and drive these stocks higher.So, if you want to give yourself a present this holiday season, you might want to consider the following four companies…Stocking Stuffer #1: ConocoPhillips (COP)ConocoPhillips (COP) is one of the largest independent exploration and production companies in the world. With an extensive energy portfolio that spans 14 countries, ConocoPhillips transports oil and natural gas around the world through its pipelines, as well as on tankers, trucks and rails. So, the company has profited from increased energy demand and rising prices.Story continuesDuring the third quarter, production rose to 1,754 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed). In turn, ConocoPhillips achieved adjusted earnings of $4.6 billion, or $3.60 per share, or 91.7% year-over-year earnings growth. The consensus estimate called for adjusted earnings of $3.44 per share.For the fourth quarter, earnings are forecast to grow 41.9% year-over-year to $3.22 per share. Revenue is anticipated to rise 16.5% year-over-year to $18.59 billion.Stocking Stuffer #2: Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC)Marathon Petroleum (MPC) operates the biggest refining system in the U.S., with 13 refineries capable of refining about 2.9 million barrels per day.In addition to its refining business, Marathon Petroleum also operates a network of pipelines, terminals and barges. Its midstream business is primarily the operations of its master limited partnership MPLX, which distributes, markets, stores and transports crude oil and refined products, as well as processes and transports natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also produces asphalt, feedstocks and petrochemicals.In the third quarter, Marathon Petroleum reported that revenue rose 41.7% year-over-year to $45.79 billion, topping estimates for $31.92 billion. Third-quarter earnings jumped 731.2% year-over-year to $4.48 billion, or $9.06 per share, up from $694 million, or $1.09 per share. Adjusted earnings per share were $7.81, which beat estimates for $7.07 per share by 10.5%.Analysts’ fourth-quarter earnings estimates have nearly doubled in the past three months. Estimates now call for fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $5.82 per share. Revenue is expected to rise 6.1% year-over-year to $37.78 billion.Stocking Stuffer #3: Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO) operated in several of the top oil and natural gas-producing regions in the U.S., with operations in Eagle Ford, Bakken Shale, the Permian Basin and STACK/SCOOP. The company anticipates that it will produce between 285 million and 290 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed) this year.Given third-quarter operational results, Marathon Oil is well on its way to achieving this goal: Third-quarter production totaled 295,000 Mboed. Oil production accounted for 166,000 million barrels.Marathon Oil also reported third-quarter adjusted earning of $832 million, or $1.24 per share, and revenue of $2.25 billion, which represented 168.4% year-over-year earnings growth and 54.6% year-over-year revenue growth. The consensus estimate called for adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share on $2.02 billion in revenue.Stocking Stuffer #4: Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) has provided energy exploration and petrochemical manufacturing services for more than 100 years. The company has energy and chemical assets around the world, including in the U.S., Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Here in the U.S., Occidental Petroleum has operations in the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico.In the third quarter, Occidental Petroleum produced 1,180 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed). Total U.S. production was 944 Mboed in the third quarter. During the first nine months of the year, the company achieved total production of 1,136 Mboed, with 902 Mboed in the U.S.Given the strong operational results, Occidental Petroleum posted robust third-quarter results. Adjusted earnings surged 180.4% year-over-year to $2.44 per share, up from $0.87 per share in the same quarter a year ago. Third-quarter revenue came in at $9.5 billion. The consensus estimate called for earnings of $2.46 per share on $9.5 billion in revenue.For more information on these four companies as well as the other stocks I like right now, sign up for Growth Investor now.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So while Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Monster Beverage:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$8.2b - US$1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Monster Beverage has an ROCE of 23%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Monster Beverage roceIn the above chart we have measured Monster Beverage's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Monster Beverage.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Monster Beverage doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 31% where it was five years ago. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Monster Beverage's ROCEIn summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Monster Beverage is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. Furthermore the stock has climbed 60% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Monster Beverage  that we think you should be aware of.Monster Beverage is not the only stock earning high returns.

(NYSE:PM) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.3m worth of shares at a price of US$111 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$102. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Philip Morris International Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Philip Morris International insiders own about US$199m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Philip Morris International shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Philip Morris International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Philip Morris International and understanding this should be part of your investment process.Of course Philip Morris International may not be the best stock to buy.

The broad-based decline of equities means that some of the best-run and most dominant companies in the U.S. have undervalued stocks to buy. These names are trading at a huge discount relative to their current and future earnings.The share prices of many highly profitable, market-leading companies have sunk by 50% or more during the current rout, in many cases erasing the gains that they achieved during the pandemic.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis presents a huge buying opportunity for investors looking to put capital to work in a weak market. And while we may not have achieved a bottom just yet, there are plenty of undervalued stocks to buy at fire-sale prices.These stocks should pay off handsomely once the market does bottom and share prices permanently reverse higher.Here are seven of the most undervalued stocks to buy now.GOOGAlphabet$89.40HDHome Depot$314AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$64.30BABoeing$194PFEPfizer$51.10JPMJPMOrgan Chase$135TGTTarget$151.50Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock isn’t likely to be this affordable again for a very long time.Following the Google parent company’s most recent earnings report, GOOGL stock dropped 6% making it easily one of the best undervalued stocks to buy.YouTube’s ad revenue fell 2% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2022, while analysts, on average, were expecting an increase of 3%. Alphabet announced several cost-cutting measures, canceling the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop computer and announcing plans to close Stadia, its digital gaming service. The company also said that it is likely to reduce its workforce in the coming months.Story continuesThe added pressure on GOOGL stock following the Q3 earnings has dragged the shares down a total of 39% in the past 2 months. (A 20-for-1 stock split in July also lowered the share price). While discouraging, the decline makes Alphabet stock look very attractive at its current levels.The company’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio has dropped along with the share price to an attractive level of 17 times, which is below the large-cap technology stocks’ average of 25 times.This year’s pullback is one of the steepest in the company’s history. Investors should take advantage of this rare opportunity.Home Depot (HD)Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue skySource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.comDown 23% over the past year,  Home Depot (NYSE:HD) recently was at its lowest level since before Covid, making it one of the undervalued stocks to buy before a comeback.The decline of the retailer’s share price hardly seems justified, considering that the Atlanta-based company reported solid third-quarter earnings.Home Depot continues to manage inflationary pressures. The company has been focused on serving professional home builders and contractors rather than putting its efforts toward serving do-it-yourself renovators and weekend warriors.The company’s sales to professionals continue to exceed its revenue from do-it-yourself projects. The firm’s strong Q3 earnings show that Home Depot has been unfairly dragged lower by the market’s downturn.Add in a P/E ratio on HD stock of 19 and a quarterly dividend that yields 2.41%, and it’s easy to make the case that investors should buy HD stock on the dip.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been especially hard hit, down 57% in the last year, making it one of the undervalued stocks to buy on an anticipated chip turnaround.In mid-October, investors could purchase the shares of AMD for $55 each, around the same level at which the stock was trading in May 2020. While AMD doesn’t pay a dividend, the company’s earnings have continued to be stellar, and its outlook is strong despite its ongoing challenges caused by supply-chain issues and inflationary pressures.On Nov. 1, the company reported third-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street analysts’ average expectations. However, the company still posted revenue growth of nearly 30% for the July through September period.AMD’s latest earnings were also negatively impacted by charges stemming from its $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx in February 2022.  Xilinx makes specialty microchips called “field-programmable gate arrays.” Despite its short-term challenges and one-time charges, AMD remains a top semiconductor stock that investors should buy while it’s on sale.Boeing (BA)Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logoSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.comBoeing Company (NYSE:BA) stock was down for the count before last year’s market downturn.Several high-profile crashes of its aircraft in the last few years had created a crisis of confidence in the Virginia-based manufacturer of passenger airplanes. However, all indications are that Boeing has turned the page and is moving forward with more stringent safety guidelines.However, this fact hasn’t helped keep BA stock off the list of undervalued stocks to buy. The stock has fallen nearly 10% in the last 12 months.Investors willing to be patient with BA stock should consider the fact that Boeing is part of a duopoly when it comes to aircraft manufacturing. That’s because France’s Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) is the only other reputable company in the world that manufactures a high number of commercial passenger airplanes.This gives Boeing an enormous advantage and puts the company in a strong competitive position. While investors continue to fret about the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) looking over the shoulders of Boeing’s executives and engineers, they miss the fact that the company continues to win lucrative contracts around the world as airlines move to replace their aircraft fleets.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is one of the world’s premier pharmaceutical companies, as well as one of the best undervalued stocks to buy right now. The company makes several blockbuster drugs.In late 2020, the company’s Covid-19 vaccine hit the market. Pfizer sold $36.7 billion worth of Covid-19 vaccines globally in 2021, representing 45% of its total revenue. In 2022, the company forecast Covid-19 vaccine sales of $54.5 billion, including booster shots.Despite the successful addition of its Covid-19 vaccine and the multi-billion dollars of revenue that it has brought in, PFE stock has declined 10% during the past year. The company’s price-earnings ratio is a modest 9.87, suggesting the stock is cheap at its current levels.Investors who snap up the shares will also benefit from a quarterly dividend that yields 3.20%. Meanwhile, Pfizer is continuing to develop its Covid-19 pill called “Paxlovid,”  and some analysts say the pill could be Pfizer’s next blockbuster medication if it gets approved by the FDA.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)A sign for JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM).Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is the biggest lender in America with nearly $4 trillion of assets under management, and the largest bank in the world with a market capitalization of $393 billion. It is also one of the better undervalued stocks to buy in the banking sector.JPMorgan Chase’s Q3 earnings did not disappoint investors. Its earnings serve as a bellwether for the banking industry, and the results bolstered sentiment among investors.While JPMorgan’s investment banking and equity trading units slowed in Q3, the bank offset those declines with greater income generated from higher interest rates charged on its loans, and also through a bump in its revenue from bond trading.JPM stock is currently down about 16% in the last year year. However, the bank’s share price has gained 26% in the past three months. The shares also currently have a low price-earnings ratio of 11.5 and pay a quarterly dividend that yields 2.9%.Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Target (TGT)Image of the Target logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) stock has dropped 36% in the last year, making it one of the most undervalued stocks in retail.The shares of the big-box department store chain had been holding up fairly well until April. That’s when the company reported Q1 earnings that showed that inflation had affected its bottom line and that it had excessive inventory.While Target has made progress in unwinding its inventories, the company continues to struggle with a host of issues. In mid-November, Target reported a Q3 earnings miss, warned of soft holiday sales, and trimmed its Q4 guidance.As one might expect, the Q3 print didn’t go over well with analysts or investors. Target cited inflationary pressures that are forcing consumers to prioritize spending as the reason for the poor financial results and difficult outlook. Target also announced plans to cut $3 billion of costs by 2025On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in GOOGL.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now. The global economy is expected to grow at a slow pace of approximately 1.6% in 2023 as financial conditions worsen, the winter antagonizes China’s COVID policy, and Europe’s natural gas problems persist. 2022 has been the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 in more than ten years, as rising interest rates, some important corporate earnings misses, and growing concerns about global growth weighed heavily on the stock market. Seasonal investing means that an investment is profitable more than half of the time. Investors become increasingly confident in a seasonal investment as the frequency of profitable trades rises. Seasonal stocks are defined by surging demand during different times of the year. For example, a company focused on designing and manufacturing snowsuits is probably not as active during the summer months, but may enjoy surges in the winter and holiday season. Similarly, air conditioning companies benefit primarily in the summer. Moreover, companies that experience peak demand during tourism months are also considered seasonal stocks, like hotels and resorts. Some of the best seasonal stocks to invest in include The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H). Our Methodology We selected the following seasonal stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 12 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Nowkmichal/Shutterstock.comBest Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now12. Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) is a Minnesota-based company that designs, engineers, manufactures, and markets power sports vehicles worldwide. It operates through three segments – Off-Road, On-Road, and Marine. The company offers off-road vehicles, including all-terrain vehicles, side-by-side vehicles, snowmobiles, and snow bikes. The demand for these vehicles typically surges in the winter. Story continuesOn December 5, Jefferies analyst Anna Glaessgen raised the price target on Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) to $106 from $100 and maintained a Hold rating on the shares, citing recent momentum. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 15 hedge funds were long Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) at the end of September 2022, compared to 13 funds in the prior quarter. The collective stakes in Q3 2022 increased to $149.3 million from $146.8 million in Q2. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 481,606 shares worth $46 million. Like The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H), Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) is one of the top seasonal stocks to invest in. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors included Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII), BOK Financial and Webster Financial. Polaris, a market leader in off-road vehicles, benefited from a restocking opportunity — inventory at dealers remains depleted, which can serve to offset near-term macroeconomic headwinds. The company also is perceived to be somewhat recession-resilient given its strong financial performance during and after the 2008 financial crisis. We took the opportunity to conclude our investment as we have increased concerns over rising competition, supply chain issues related to sourcing semiconductors and the business’s higher-than-perceived cyclicality.”11. The Toro Company (NYSE:TTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18The Toro Company (NYSE:TTC) was founded in 1914 and is headquartered in Bloomington, Minnesota.

The Company benefited from pricing actions it took earlier in the year, offsetting rising input cost inflation. An important proof-point we consider when evaluating the competitive advantage of any business is whether margins can be maintained (or expanded), especially during periods of inflation. In addition, Toro continues to see robust demand for its professional and residential products. The Company has a backlog in its professional segment that is at its highest level since the year began, whereas residential products grew +7% on strong year and 2-year comparisons and despite many “home” categories across big-box retailers witnessing declines.The Toro Corporation has an illustrious history stretching back to its founding in 1914. Many of us first encountered The Toro Company in the rite of passage when our parents finally relented in allowing us to cut the grass for the first time when we were barely taller than the lawn mower handle. From the Company’s humble beginning building tractor engines for the Bull Tractor Company in Bloomington, Milwaukee, the Company has methodically grown into the diversified conglomerate of today that possesses industry leading brand awareness, market share, technological prowess, and profitability.We are always enamored with a company’s beginnings, so herewith is the short story of The Toro Corporation’s storied history. The “Toro” name was chosen given its first relationship with The Bull Tractor Company, which according to Company documents was the #1 brand of farm tractors in 1914. Shortly after, in 1919, the Company created the mechanized golf course equipment industry with their invention of The Toro Standard Golf Machine…” (Click here to read the full text)10.

Mason Hawkins’ Southeastern Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $215.5 million. Baron Funds made the following comment about Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of global hotelier Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) increased in the quarter on strong revenue-per-available-room results as business travel continued to recover from pandemic lows. While leisure rates dropped a little in the seasonally slower back-to-school period, this decline was expected and was more than offset by increases in business transient and group bookings. Robust rates across the industry are leading to higher margins, including for Hyatt. Hyatt is using the increased cash flow to buy-in its shares, indicating that it sees value in the stock.”8. Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) is a California-based children's entertainment company that designs and manufactures toys and consumer products worldwide.

(NASDAQ:MAT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Mattel (24%, 1.40%; 16%, 0.96%), the global toy and media company, was a strong contributor in the fourth quarter and for the year. Despite store closures in Asia causing -20% regional revenues during the third quarter, Mattel’s consolidated sales still grew 8% due to its strong North American recovery. Barbie sales remain impressive as they have been for years, American Girl is finally returning to growth and Fisher Price is also recovering. The company is successfully passing through inflated costs with higher pricing and without losing volume. Despite the impressive results, the stock trades too low at less than 14x forward earnings, and that is before Mattel begins to monetize its massive non-earning asset Intellectual Property portfolio. Our appraisal of the value grew by more than 30% this year.”7. Lennox International Inc. (NYSE:LII)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Lennox International Inc. (NYSE:LII) is a Texas-based company that designs, manufactures, and markets products for the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration markets in the United States, Canada, and internationally.

(NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick‘s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Jim Cramer Stock Picks This Week15 Biggest Dry Bulk Shipping Companies in 202210 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity, ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption, petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise, industrial, transportation, and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S., and natural gas is the most widely used production source, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world, the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), an American firm, the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle, but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun, as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days, these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front, MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective, scalable, reliable, and efficient at the same time. To do this, they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.When talking about energy, any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions, fission and fusion. With the former, atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However, the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source, and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion, the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.Story continuesAdditionally, America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year, in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally, global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production, after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Today, we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms, with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and NextEra Energy, Inc.

In fact, in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries, all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy, where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.The U.S, on the other hand, saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies, and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However, this does not mean that prices are low, as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America, these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.However, these prices, which end up in massive profits for power producers, do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg, these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This, according to analysts, can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3,700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).Story continuesToday we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans.

30,2e469bce-e04a-369e-9f6d-94e14a97fae5,ZTS,2022-12-26,Zoetis' (NYSE:ZTS) investors will be pleased with their splendid 109% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoetis-nyse-zts-investors-pleased-130053331.html,1672059653,STORY,['ZTS'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 102% in five years. In the last week the share price is up 1.8%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Zoetis managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Zoetis' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Zoetis, it has a TSR of 109% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 22% in the twelve months, Zoetis shareholders did even worse, losing 40% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Zoetis that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesOf course Zoetis may not be the best stock to buy.

This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity, ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption, petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise, industrial, transportation, and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S., and natural gas is the most widely used production source, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world, the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), an American firm, the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle, but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun, as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days, these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front, MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective, scalable, reliable, and efficient at the same time. To do this, they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.When talking about energy, any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions, fission and fusion. With the former, atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However, the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source, and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion, the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.Story continuesAdditionally, America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year, in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally, global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production, after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Today, we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms, with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and NextEra Energy, Inc.

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Boeing’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing Is Boeing Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Boeing is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $257.69, but it is currently trading at US$189 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Boeing’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Boeing?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With revenues expected to grow by 60% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Boeing. If the level of expenses is able to be maintained, it looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since BA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on BA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy BA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

40,a560860e-6395-33e6-a0bb-2d4a27a59b51,SO,2022-12-26,The Return Trends At Southern (NYSE:SO) Look Promising,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-trends-southern-nyse-look-120039510.html,1672056039,STORY,['SO'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Southern's (NYSE:SO) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Southern:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.045 = US$5.5b ÷ (US$134b - US$13b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Southern has an ROCE of 4.5%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 4.6%, it's still a low return by itself. Check out our latest analysis for Southern roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Southern compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Southern.How Are Returns Trending?We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 4.5%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 24%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Southern thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.Our Take On Southern's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Southern can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with a respectable 86% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Southern can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesSouthern does come with some risks though, we found 4 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is a bit concerning...While Southern isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

In fact, in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries, all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy, where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.The U.S, on the other hand, saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies, and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However, this does not mean that prices are low, as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America, these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.However, these prices, which end up in massive profits for power producers, do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg, these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This, according to analysts, can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3,700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).Story continuesToday we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), NextEra Energy, Inc.

This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity, ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption, petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise, industrial, transportation, and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S., and natural gas is the most widely used production source, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world, the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), an American firm, the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle, but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun, as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days, these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front, MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective, scalable, reliable, and efficient at the same time. To do this, they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.When talking about energy, any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions, fission and fusion. With the former, atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However, the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source, and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion, the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.Story continuesAdditionally, America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year, in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally, global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production, after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Today, we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms, with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and NextEra Energy, Inc.

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Unfortunately the TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) share price slid 28% over twelve months. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 22%. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 19% in the last three years. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 11% in a month. However, we note the price may have been impacted by the broader market, which is down 4.6% in the same time period.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the unfortunate twelve months during which the TE Connectivity share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 9.3%. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.It's surprising to see the share price fall so much, despite the improved EPS. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.With a low yield of 2.0% we doubt that the dividend influences the share price much. TE Connectivity's revenue is actually up 9.0% over the last year. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthTE Connectivity is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think TE Connectivity will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 22% in the twelve months, TE Connectivity shareholders did even worse, losing 27% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand TE Connectivity better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - TE Connectivity has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But note: TE Connectivity may not be the best stock to buy.

44,2b264f6e-0fa8-3f1a-8733-e58e850f581c,NOC,2022-12-26,Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Northrop Grumman Corporation's (NYSE:NOC) Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robust-financials-driving-recent-rally-120055033.html,1672056055,STORY,['NOC'],"[Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 13% over the last three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Northrop Grumman's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Northrop Grumman is:40% = US$5.5b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.40 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Northrop Grumman's Earnings Growth And 40% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Northrop Grumman has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Northrop Grumman's moderate 17% net income growth seen over the past five years.As a next step, we compared Northrop Grumman's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 5.5%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for NOC? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Northrop Grumman Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Northrop Grumman's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 21% (implying that it retains 79% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.Moreover, Northrop Grumman is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 30% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 26%) over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Northrop Grumman's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

The stock market will also be closed on Monday, December 26. Your next Market 360 article will be available on Tuesday, December 27. We hope you enjoy the long holiday weekend!With Christmas just a few days away, I want to share with you the best stocks for your portfolio stocking stuffers: energy stocks.You may be wondering, why not tech stocks? After all many are now trading at ultra-low prices, including big tech names like Amazon.com (AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Google Inc. (GOOG), which recently fell to new 52-week lows.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut here’s the reality: Technology and energy stocks’ weighting in the S&amp;P 500 is shifting.Just a year ago, energy accounted for less than 2% of the S&amp;P 500, while technology accounted for about 48%. I predict that energy stocks will account for 30% of the S&amp;P 500 in early 2025, as technology stocks fall to about 32%.So, as the weightings steadily change in the S&amp;P 500, the tracking manager crowd (i.e., closet indexers) will be systematically forced to buy more energy stocks as leading technology stocks falter. In other words, tracking managers will be a net buyer of energy stocks (given their strong earnings momentum) and a net seller of technology stocks.I should also add that, according to FactSet, the energy sector posted the best earnings growth in 2022, with earnings surging 151.7% in 2022.The fact of the matter is oil and natural gas companies will boast the strongest earnings and sales growth for the next several quarters – and positive results should dropkick and drive these stocks higher.So, if you want to give yourself a present this holiday season, you might want to consider the following four companies…Stocking Stuffer #1: ConocoPhillips (COP)ConocoPhillips (COP) is one of the largest independent exploration and production companies in the world. With an extensive energy portfolio that spans 14 countries, ConocoPhillips transports oil and natural gas around the world through its pipelines, as well as on tankers, trucks and rails. So, the company has profited from increased energy demand and rising prices.Story continuesDuring the third quarter, production rose to 1,754 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed). In turn, ConocoPhillips achieved adjusted earnings of $4.6 billion, or $3.60 per share, or 91.7% year-over-year earnings growth. The consensus estimate called for adjusted earnings of $3.44 per share.For the fourth quarter, earnings are forecast to grow 41.9% year-over-year to $3.22 per share. Revenue is anticipated to rise 16.5% year-over-year to $18.59 billion.Stocking Stuffer #2: Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC)Marathon Petroleum (MPC) operates the biggest refining system in the U.S., with 13 refineries capable of refining about 2.9 million barrels per day.In addition to its refining business, Marathon Petroleum also operates a network of pipelines, terminals and barges. Its midstream business is primarily the operations of its master limited partnership MPLX, which distributes, markets, stores and transports crude oil and refined products, as well as processes and transports natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also produces asphalt, feedstocks and petrochemicals.In the third quarter, Marathon Petroleum reported that revenue rose 41.7% year-over-year to $45.79 billion, topping estimates for $31.92 billion. Third-quarter earnings jumped 731.2% year-over-year to $4.48 billion, or $9.06 per share, up from $694 million, or $1.09 per share. Adjusted earnings per share were $7.81, which beat estimates for $7.07 per share by 10.5%.Analysts’ fourth-quarter earnings estimates have nearly doubled in the past three months. Estimates now call for fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $5.82 per share. Revenue is expected to rise 6.1% year-over-year to $37.78 billion.Stocking Stuffer #3: Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO) operated in several of the top oil and natural gas-producing regions in the U.S., with operations in Eagle Ford, Bakken Shale, the Permian Basin and STACK/SCOOP. The company anticipates that it will produce between 285 million and 290 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed) this year.Given third-quarter operational results, Marathon Oil is well on its way to achieving this goal: Third-quarter production totaled 295,000 Mboed. Oil production accounted for 166,000 million barrels.Marathon Oil also reported third-quarter adjusted earning of $832 million, or $1.24 per share, and revenue of $2.25 billion, which represented 168.4% year-over-year earnings growth and 54.6% year-over-year revenue growth. The consensus estimate called for adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share on $2.02 billion in revenue.Stocking Stuffer #4: Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) has provided energy exploration and petrochemical manufacturing services for more than 100 years. The company has energy and chemical assets around the world, including in the U.S., Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Here in the U.S., Occidental Petroleum has operations in the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico.In the third quarter, Occidental Petroleum produced 1,180 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed). Total U.S. production was 944 Mboed in the third quarter. During the first nine months of the year, the company achieved total production of 1,136 Mboed, with 902 Mboed in the U.S.Given the strong operational results, Occidental Petroleum posted robust third-quarter results. Adjusted earnings surged 180.4% year-over-year to $2.44 per share, up from $0.87 per share in the same quarter a year ago. Third-quarter revenue came in at $9.5 billion. The consensus estimate called for earnings of $2.46 per share on $9.5 billion in revenue.For more information on these four companies as well as the other stocks I like right now, sign up for Growth Investor now.

53,4af26891-09c2-3906-90da-e2c8c3d5cee2,TGT,2022-12-26,3 Grocery Stocks With Reliable Dividends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-grocery-stocks-reliable-dividends-161748386.html,1671725868,STORY,"['TGT', 'KR', 'SPTN']","[The Federal Reserve has adopted an exceptionally aggressive policy this year to restore inflation to its long-term target of 2%. To this end, it has raised interest rates at a record pace this year. Plus, it intends to raise them even further next year. Higher interest rates exert a drag on the economy, as they reduce the total amount of investments, and hence they have increased the risk of an upcoming recession.Grocery stocks are not immune to recessions, but they have proved fairly resilient, as consumers have to visit grocery stores even under the most adverse economic conditions. In this article, we will discuss the prospects of three grocery stocks. These companies have proved fairly resilient to recessions and offer reliable dividends.KRKroger$44.56TGTTarget$140.04SPTNSpartanNash$31.06InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFounded in 1883, Kroger (NYSE:KR) is one of the largest retailers in the U.S. The company has nearly 2,800 retail stores under two dozen banners, along with fuel centers, pharmacies and jewelry stores in 35 states.Thanks to its immense network of stores, Kroger enjoys significant economies of scale. However, competition has heated more than ever in the retail sector in recent years. As a result, Kroger operates with razor-thin margins. Thus, it lacks a meaningful business moat.On the other hand, Kroger has proved resilient during recessions. In the Great Recession, while most companies saw their earnings collapse, Kroger incurred a benign 8% decrease in its earnings per share, from 95 cents in 2008 to 87 cents in 2009. During the coronavirus pandemic, Kroger performed even better. Thanks to the lockdowns imposed in response to the pandemic, at-home consumption greatly increased. Thus, Kroger grew its EPS 58%, from $2.19 in 2019 to an all-time high of $3.47 in 2020.Even better, the company has maintained its positive momentum, with 6% EPS growth in 2021 and 11% expected growth this year. Kroger has benefited from its “Restock Kroger” project, which has improved the efficiency of the company and enhanced its operating margins. The bottom line has also been assisted by meaningful share repurchases. As the stock of Kroger has traded at low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios in recent years, the share repurchases have greatly enhanced shareholder value.Story continuesIn mid-October, Kroger announced that it agreed to acquire Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) for $24.6 billion. As the value of the deal is 75% of the market capitalization of Kroger, it is obvious that this acquisition is major for the future prospects of the company. Regulatory authorities are concerned that this deal may result in higher prices for consumers. As a result, no one can be completely sure that the deal will materialize. Nevertheless, if the deal is approved by regulators, it will probably prove a significant growth driver for Kroger.Kroger has a decent dividend growth record. It has raised its dividend for 17 consecutive quarters and has grown its dividend by 14% per year on average over the last five years. The stock is currently offering a 2.3% dividend, which is a nearly 10-year high for the stock. Given its healthy payout ratio of only 25%, Kroger is likely to continue raising its dividend for many more years, though it will probably have to reduce its dividend growth rate if it spends $24.6 billion on the aforementioned acquisition.Target (TGT)Image of the Target logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comFounded in 1902, Target (NYSE:TGT) has approximately 1,850 big box stores, which offer general merchandise and food and serve as distribution points for the company’s burgeoning e-commerce business. After a failed attempt to expand into Canada, Target has operations solely in the U.S. market.Due to intense competition and the excessive losses it incurred during its expansion attempt, Target failed to grow its EOS meaningfully between 2012 and 2017. However, thanks to its turnaround efforts, Target has returned to its long-term growth trajectory in recent years. Notably, the retailer grew its EPS by an impressive 47% in 2020, partly thanks to the tailwind from the pandemic, and by another 44% last year. During the last decade, the company has grown its EPS by 13% per year on average. It also proved fairly resilient in the Great Recession, when EPS dipped only 14%.Unfortunately, Target has been severely hurt by the surge of inflation to a 40-year high this year. Due to excessive inflation, the company has incurred a sharp contraction in its operating margins. In addition, the surge of inflation has made consumers more conservative in their discretionary spending. As a result, Target has experienced soft demand. Thus, its inventories have greatly increased. Due to these headwinds, the company is poised to incur a nearly 60% plunge in EPS this year. This helps explain the 42% slump of the stock off its peak in April.On the bright side, thanks to aggressive interest rate hikes, inflation is likely to subside in the upcoming years. As a result, Target is likely to enhance its margins from its current razor-thin levels. The company also has some significant growth drivers in place, namely its small-format stores and share repurchases.Target has raised its dividend for 54 consecutive years and therefore belongs to the Dividend Kings. The company raised its dividend by 20% this year, and its payout ratio has jumped from 23% in 2021 to 79% now. However, thanks to the expected recovery of its business, Target will likely be able to keep raising its dividend for many more years. Therefore, the 2.8% yield of the stock should be considered safe. Additionally, the 20% dividend raise announced in June is a testament to the confidence of management in the company’s recovery.SpartanNash (SPTN)A photo of a hand holding a phone with the Spartan Nash logo on it.Source: Piotr Swat/ShutterStock.comSpartanNash (NASDAQ:SPTN) is a value-added wholesale grocery distributor and retailer. It supplies 2,100 independent grocery retail locations in the U.S. and also owns itself 147 supermarkets in nine states. SpartanNash operates under retail banners such as Dan’s Supermarket, D&amp;W Fresh Market, Econofoods, Family Fare, Forest Hill Foods and No Frills. The company is also a distributor of grocery products to U.S. military commissaries.SpartanNash has been much less affected than Target by the surge of inflation this year. The retailer has managed to partly offset its increased supply-chain costs with improved efficiency and cost reductions. With only one quarter left, the company expects to grow its sales from $8.9 billion in 2021 to between $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion this year. This implies 8% growth at the mid-point. It also expects to grow its EPS from $1.70 in 2021 to $2.27-$2.37 this year, implying 36% growth at the mid-point.On the other hand, SpartanNash has a remarkably volatile performance record. The company has grown its EPS by only 2.2% per year on average over the last decade, with pronounced volatility. Given that the retailer is on track to post nearly all-time high EPS this year, investors should be aware of its choppy performance record.In the Great Recession, SpartanNash incurred a 25% decrease in its earnings per share. Therefore, it performed worse than Kroger and Target but still proved fairly resistant to recessions. The company has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years and is currently offering a 2.7% dividend yield, with a payout ratio of 36%. Thanks to the healthy payout ratio of SpartanNash and its manageable amount of debt, its dividend should be considered safe. On the other hand, the company has grown its dividend by only 5% per year on average over the last five years. Given the volatile performance of the retailer, it is prudent not to expect greater dividend raises going forward.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We'll use ROE to examine Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Boston Properties How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Boston Properties is:13% = US$1.1b ÷ US$8.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.13 in profit.Does Boston Properties Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Boston Properties has a superior ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Boston Properties.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Boston Properties' Debt And Its 13% Return On EquityBoston Properties does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.65. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

55,65b41109-66f0-3ac9-8f86-8029edcf5f28,CSX,2022-12-26,Investors in CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) have made a favorable return of 82% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-csx-nasdaq-csx-made-110041682.html,1672052441,STORY,['CSX'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) shareholders have enjoyed a 70% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 38% (not including dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for CSX To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, CSX achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 11% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of CSX, it has a TSR of 82% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that CSX returned a loss of 15% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 13% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with CSX , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

(NASDAQ:ADI) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript November 22, 2022Analog Devices, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $2.73, expectations were $2.58.Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call. Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&amp;A. Sir, the floor is yours.Michael Lucarelli: Thank you, Betsy, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. On to disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and in our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call.We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vince. Vince?Photo by Israel Andrade on UnsplashVincent Roche: Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. Well, I'm really extremely pleased to share that we delivered another record quarter, capping off what was a better year for ADI. Our fourth quarter revenue was $3.25 billion, and adjusted EPS was $2.73, and both at the high end of our outlook. For the fiscal year, revenue was $12 billion, up an impressive 26% year-over-year on a combined basis. Our Industrial, Automotive and Communications markets delivered all-time high revenues, and our Consumer business continued to grow despite industry-wide weakness. Adjusted EPS increased by nearly 50% to $9.57. We also delivered on our commitment to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in '22, returning $4.6 billion through share repurchases and dividends.Story continuesThese results not only exemplify the strength of our portfolio, but also our deep customer focus and the hard work of our employees to fortify ADI's brand. To that end, in my recent conversations with customers, the message has been very clear. While we're not immune to supply disruptions, ADI's service, quality and support throughout this challenging time continues to be outstanding. Importantly, this sentiment is shared by customers of all sizes and across all markets. As a result, our customers are calling upon ADI to engage in longer term, more strategic collaborations to develop solutions that further empower the intelligent edge. So to ensure we remain at the forefront of technological advancements and customer service. We invested $1.7 billion in R&amp;D and $700 million in CapEx in FY'22.Now let me start with R&amp;D. Our investments are targeted at strengthening our foundational high-performance Analog franchises as well as moving up the stack to create more complete solutions for our customers. A prime example is our Apollo platform, which we previewed at our Investor Day in April. Apollo is a flexible high-speed signal processing platform with unmatched levels of functionality, integration and performance, making it ubiquitous for all customers, but especially appealing to those in the broad market. During the quarter, we began sampling this innovative platform with our aerospace, communications and instrumentation customers and their feedback has been extremely positive. Turning now to the operations side. Over the last year, we invested a record amount of CapEx to increase our manufacturing output.And in 2023, we are, once again, investing aggressively in our U.S. and European factories to significantly expand our capacity. These investments will create a more flexible and cost-effective hybrid manufacturing model by increasing our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years. Our R&amp;D and supply chain investments are essential to support our design win pipeline, which expanded by more than 10% in '22. This growth was led by our automotive energy systems and digital healthcare businesses. Notably, our growth in Automotive was underpinned by battery management systems, or BMS, which now has an opportunity pipeline nearing $4 billion. This year, eight new manufacturers designed in our BMS solutions, including two that plan to utilize our wireless platform.Our strong leadership position combined with increasing EV penetration globally, gives me great confidence in our future growth prospects. Looking now at some selected design activity in the quarter. In industrial automation, we were designed into an advanced diagnostic system that monitors machine health at a global supplier for energy exploration. Our system solution approach enables an approximate 50% reduction in size and lowers wiring costs meaningfully. In aerospace and defense, we won RF module programs at multiple defense prime contractors. Our modules integrate hundreds of components to simplify the design process for our customers, while increasing our content from hundreds to thousands of dollars per system. In industrial instrumentation, we secured wins at two market leaders of next-generation high-voltage testers for electric vehicles and renewable energy systems.The combination of our high voltage processes and precision technology enables us to deliver accurate, reliable, and efficient testing required to scale the manufacturing of these systems. And lastly, in Communications, we expanded our leadership in 5G radio systems with our transceiver portfolio winning additional share at key suppliers. These new wins position us even better as 5G networks roll out globally, especially in India, and ORAN begins to proliferate. Importantly, our design pipeline is beginning to benefit from cross-selling our ADI and Maxim portfolios. This puts us on a path to achieve our target $1 billion in revenue synergies. For example, at a European auto manufacturer, we built upon our strong audio connectivity position to cross-sell our high-speed GMSL technology, connecting their advanced driver systems.We're also capturing new opportunities with GMSL in the Industrial market. Last quarter, for example, our technology was designed into autonomous order fulfillment systems at one of the largest e-commerce companies. We're also making great inroads with our broader power portfolio, where our opportunity pipeline increased by double digits last year. Our increased breadth is helping us to better match customers' performance and power trade-offs across more applications, expanding our power SAM to nearly $10 billion. For example, at a leading European industrial customer, our position in mid-voltage power for distributed I/O control systems enabled us to pull through additional power content and precision signal chain sockets, thereby doubling our content per system.Our expanding pipeline and significant revenue synergy opportunities instils greater diversity and resilience into our business, while adding new growth vectors. And taken together, I'm confident in our ability to bend the growth curve and move from our historical mid-single digit growth rate to our long-term model of 7% to 10%. So in summary, while the macro crosscurrents are creating an abundance of uncertainty, ADI has successfully navigated many slowdowns over the course of our 57 year history. The strength of our franchise allows us to invest through business cycles, ensuring we continue to deliver breakthrough innovation, deepen our relevance to our customers and capture the emerging secular opportunities at the intelligent edge. And so with that, I'll pass you over to Prashanth.See also Countries By GDP: 30 Biggest Economies in the World and 12 Biggest Industries in the US.Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We closed fiscal 2022 as our second consecutive year of record revenue and profits. We delivered sequential growth each quarter, achieving a new all-time high of $12 billion in revenue; gross margins of 73.6% increased 270 basis points due to favorable product mix, stronger utilization and cost synergies; operating margin of 49.4% increased 700 basis points, reflecting strong execution on OpEx synergies' and adjusted EPS increased nearly 50% to $9.57. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.25 billion, finishing at the high end of our outlook.As I cover the performance by end market, both for the quarter and full year, my growth comments are on an adjusted combined basis where applicable. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market hit another all-time high and represented 51% of quarterly revenue. Growth was broad-based with each major application increasing sequentially and year-over-year. For the year, Industrial expanded 29% with growth in each business. Notably, digital healthcare was up over 30% and has now achieved seven straight record years. This consistent success in healthcare underscores the breadth of our ICs and subsystem solutions in a key secular growth market where such performance is critical. Automotive, which represented 21% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record year, growing both sequentially and year-over-year.For the year, Auto was up 31%, a favorable mix of premium vehicles, our growing BMS, GMSL, A2B and functional safe power franchises, combined with enhanced value capture drove significant growth compared to SAAR. Together, these franchises of BMS, GMSL, A2B and functional safe power represent over $1 billion of Automotive revenue. Communications, which represented 15% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record quarter with strong sequential growth in wireline, while our wireless business was about flat. For the year, Comms grew 27%. In wireless, our strong position in radio signal chains is enabling the 5G rollout globally. And in wireline, our optical and power portfolios benefited from the continued demand for bandwidth. Lastly, Consumer represented 13% of quarterly revenue and was up modestly sequentially and flat year-over-year.Despite a challenging year for the broader industry, Consumer finished up 8%. This growth is a testament to how we have diversified our Consumer business and the innovation premium our products command. Today, approximately 30% of revenue is derived from long life cycle prosumer applications, including next-gen conferencing systems, professional AV and home theater, while the remaining revenue in Consumer relates to the faster-growing wearables and hearables as well as premium smartphones. Now I'll move down the P&amp;L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 74%, up 310 basis points year-over-year driven by favorable product mix and synergy capture. OpEx was $744 million, down slightly sequentially due to the realization of additional synergies.And operating margin increased 800 basis points year-over-year, finishing at a record 51.1% as we exited the year with roughly $350 million of synergies realized across OpEx and cost of goods in our run rate. This incredible pace of synergy capture would not have been possible without the dedication of our integration office and the cross-functional teams that supported them. Non-op expenses were $57 million, and the tax rate was 12.2%. All told, adjusted EPS came in at $2.73, up 58% year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents and our net leverage ratio continues to remain below 1. Days of inventory increased to 140 while channel inventory was once again below our target range of 7 to 8 weeks.Let me provide some additional details on our inventory. But first, during these uncertain times, we believe it is prudent to temporarily hold more finished goods on our balance sheet instead of shipping into the channel. This provides us with enhanced flexibility to better align supply with end customer demand across regions and markets. Second, raw material and WIP are increasing as we begin to rebuild our die bank. Over the last couple of years, our die bank was drastically reduced. And in some cases, sits 50% below optimal levels. Die bank inventory is highly cost efficient and it's critical for customer service as it can be used for different markets and customers. We believe higher inventory is crucial to reducing lead times as we look to return to our 4- to 8-week target service level over time.Given these actions, we expect inventory to increase in the near term before trending back down as we balance die bank rebuild with finished goods depletion. Moving to cash flow items. CapEx was $305 million for the quarter and $699 million for the year or 6% of revenue. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we expect elevated CapEx through 2023 at around high single digits as a percentage of revenue. For fiscal 2022, we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow or 31% of revenue. This is lower than normal given our higher capital intensity and onetime transaction and restructuring costs. These near-term headwinds were not unexpected when we outlined our long-term free cash flow target at our Investor Day and we remain committed to growing free cash flow to 40% of revenue.As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We aim to grow our dividend at a 10% CAGR through the cycle with the remaining cash used for share count reduction. And during the year, we returned more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. We repurchased $3.1 billion in shares, reducing share count by nearly 4%, while paying $1.5 billion of dividends. So let me close with a brief update on the current operating backdrop. As we noted last quarter, the uncertain and slowing macroeconomic environment has had some impact on demand. However, after a couple of months of slowing orders, we saw bookings stabilize during the quarter at what we'd consider relatively normal levels for entering our first quarter. Not surprisingly, bookings remain the strongest in the Industrial and Auto, while Communications and Consumer are weaker.We're guiding first quarter revenue to $3.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Given this environment, we thought it might be helpful to be a little more prescriptive in our outlook by market. So in the first quarter, we expect Auto to be up slightly sequentially; Industrial about flat; Comms to decline by mid-single digits; and Consumer to be down double digits sequentially. At the midpoint of our outlook, revenue will be up high teens year-over-year and our B2B markets increasing over 20%. Op margins are expected to be 50% plus or minus 70 bps. Tax rate is expected to be between 12% to 14%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS should be $2.60 plus or minus $0.10. So stepping back, we are well positioned in the near term, but the environment remains highly variable and dynamic.ADI like the rest of the industry is not immune to a softer macro environment; and thus, we remain cautious, yet optimistic. Longer term, we have over a year of backlog and continued momentum in our pipeline. We also have high flexibility with our hybrid manufacturing model and several OpEx levers in our toolkit to support our industry-leading margins and maintain robust cash returns to shareholders. So let me now pass it back to Mike for the Q&amp;A.Michael Lucarelli: Thanks, Prashanth. Now let's get to my fair part of the call, the Q&amp;A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have any follow-up question, please queue and we'll take your question if time allows.

The Federal Reserve is continuing to hike rates, likely targeting a 5% terminal rate, which we could see in 2023. Moreover, the Fed aims to hold at this terminal rate for a long time, which could put interest rates above inflation. Combining that with the current economic climate, there is a good chance of a recession next year.Conversely, many stocks are at record lows already, with little room for more decline. There are also companies that benefit from higher interest rates, such as banking companies. They could surge in 2023 regardless of a recession.Furthermore, the stock market usually bottoms out six months before the economy does in a recession. Even under harsh economic conditions, undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals will likely surge in 2023. The following three are such stocks:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVVisa$202.86METAMeta Platforms$115.20ORLYO’Reilly Automotive$824.26Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is one of the world’s largest credit card networks. With 3.9 billion Visa cards in use processing over 255.4 billion transactions, it is a safe bet for investors looking for long-term growth. Visa’s model is a platform-based business that easily turns sales into profits and consistently delivers high margins. Its net profit margin currently sits at over 50%, unheard of in 2022 due to margin compression.Additionally, Visa has strategically acquired and partnered with various fintech companies, helping to protect its top spot in the credit card processing market. Moreover, the recent market downturn has only caused Visa’s stock to drop 6.6% year-to-date (YTD), making it an attractive buy for investors looking for more stability. Its five-year gain is also double that of the S&amp;P 500.Over the past three years, Visa has grown its EBITDA by 8.9% yearly and revenue by 10.7%. Visa’s dividend yields 0.87%, and the company has raised its dividends consecutively for the last 13 years. In addition, rising interest rates are improving profits for Visa, which is why V is one of the best stocks to buy for 2023.Story continuesMeta Platforms (META)An image of a VR headset and headphones; the word metaverse on the headsetSource: PopTika/ShutterstockMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) might look like a counterintuitive market idea in this environment, which is why it is among the most overlooked stocks in 2022. Virtual reality and blockchain-related segments are far from the spotlight, and when they are a company’s main focus, they can quickly degrade the company’s value.However, investors need to consider that Meta still owns Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. The “Family of Apps” is still Meta’s cash cow and generates enough profits to keep its metaverse project afloat. Meta made $32 billion in operating profits from the “Family of Apps,” while it spent $9.4 billion on Reality Labs in the first nine months of 2022.Even the Metaverse project could generate profits for Meta if virtual reality starts gaining popularity in the long run. Of course, it’s too early to tell if that will ever come true. But what is clear is that Meta should not be trading at an 11x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Once ad revenue snaps back and growth returns, investors will pay a much higher premium for Meta stock.Simply put, the metaverse is a cyclical segment, and buying at the bottom is a great idea. Meta is among the top stocks to buy before the market inevitably U-turns.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)Source: ShutterstockO’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) is up nearly 17% this year, and I expect the stock to surge even more in the coming years. As the economy deteriorates, fewer Americans are purchasing new cars. That might be bad for most car companies, but O’Reilly is an exception since its primary focus is car parts.The U.S. civilian car fleet is aging rapidly, and the average car is 13.1 years old. It is hard to see the fleet getting younger anytime soon, as a new vehicle comes with many additional headaches, such as higher insurance costs. Thus, as fewer Americans replace their cars, auto parts retailers such as O’Reilly Automotive see profits rapidly increasing. I expect these profits to stay elevated through a recession, as getting your vehicle repaired is essential.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

58,e4de6daa-75fb-3055-b962-39847afbb1e5,APH,2022-12-26,Is Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-corporation-nyse-aph-expensive-133055764.html,1671975055,STORY,['APH'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Amphenol Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.85bUS$1.94bUS$2.26bUS$2.37bUS$2.45bUS$2.53bUS$2.60bUS$2.66bUS$2.72bUS$2.78bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.52%Est @ 3.06%Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.24% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$46bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$46b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$21bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$36b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$75.8, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amphenol as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.115. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AmphenolStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electronic market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For Amphenol, there are three additional factors you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Snap-on’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Snap-on What Is Snap-on Worth?Good news, investors! Snap-on is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $287.31, but it is currently trading at US$228 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Snap-on’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Snap-on?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -1.9% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Snap-on. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although SNA is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to SNA, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SNA for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. While conducting our analysis, we found that Snap-on has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.If you are no longer interested in Snap-on, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$49.77, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Verizon CommunicationsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Advisor, Tamara Erwin, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$49.77 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$38.41. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Tamara Erwin was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Verizon Communications insiders own 0.02% of the company, worth about US$29m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Verizon Communications Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Verizon Communications insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Our analysis of Verizon Communications insider transactions leaves us cautious. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the electronics industry and go straight to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics. Electronics encompasses one of the broadest ranges of products in the modern world, from TVs, computers, music players, smartphones, tablets and watches among many others. It has been one of the most transformative industries in the world for the past 50 years.How Moore’s Law Will Impact the Electronics Industry?Currently, the latest chips are made on the 5 nm fabrication process and companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited (NYSE:TSMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (KSE:005930.KS) have set up their timelines for 2 nm chips in 2025. However, experts predict that a fundamental limit would be reached in two or three upcoming iterations. Many believe quantum computing is the answer to Moore’s law ending. However, it's an ill-informed opinion since quantum computers are limited to a very narrow range of computing problems, almost all of which have no commercial potential.Instead, companies like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have come up with some of the most realistic solutions, by moving to specialized chips intended for specific purposes. For instance, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has introduced DGX Systems, with the objective to accelerate machine learning programs, at a higher efficiency than offered by general purpose computers. The future of electronics that compute is likely to lie in specialized chips. It is reflected in the fact that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have also moved in that direction, with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) coming up with task-specific processors like Xeon, an architecture designed for AI. Similarly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been rolling out ‘Neural Engine’ since 2017 in its iPhones to accelerate AI applications like facial recognition. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the neural engine in its line of computers with the M1 chip architecture in 2020. Story continuesThe trend suggests that the electronics industry will survive the ending of Moore’s law and adapt to the paradigm shift. When the Chips are Down: What Semiconductor Shortage and Stagflation Mean for Electronics IndustryThe outlook for the electronics industry in the wake of chip shortage is bleak. It is not expected to subside anytime soon.  Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), says shortage may last until 2024,However, a more reasonable timeframe for the shortage to end is 2025, per Ondrej Burkacky from McKinsey, primarily due to the complexities associated with the manufacturing infrastructure. The post-pandemic stagflation has also slumped the high demand in consumer electronics, which had picked up pace during the pandemic, as people learned, worked and entertained themselves digitally at homes during lockdowns. The weak demand is expected to ease the supply-chains problems and shortage. Companies like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have cut their annual-sales outlooks as reported by the WSJ.In China, the sales of both smartphones and PCs, among other electronic products, have dropped, with the Consumer Electronics Index down by 32% as of July, 2022.  Globally, the shipment of PCs and smartphones have fallen by 4.7% and 10% respectively. 2030 OutlookThe market for consumer electronics has been showing a long-term cooling trend and is expected to shift from growth to cycle in the near to medium term. However, according to Yang Liuqing, an analyst at CITIC, the opportunities in Augmented and Virtual Reality hardware still represent a huge potential for growth.According to Precedence Research, the market for electronics is valued at $724.48 billion as of 2021 and is expected to reach $1.13 trillion by 2030, growing at a modest CAGR of 5.1%. The market will experience its fastest growth in countries in the Asia-Pacific, but the largest market share will still be retained by countries in North America, per the report. Japan, South Korea and the US are some of the most advanced countries in electronics. Below, we list the 12 most advanced countries in electronics. 12 Most Advanced Countries in ElectronicsOur MethodologyFor our list of the 12 most advanced countries in electronics, we’ve ranked them based on their electronics-manufacturing infrastructure, technology and research institutes.

(NYSE:OKE)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-oneok-inc-100451989.html,1672049091,STORY,['OKE'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for ONEOK What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.06bUS$2.32bUS$2.14bUS$2.23bUS$2.26bUS$2.30bUS$2.34bUS$2.39bUS$2.43bUS$2.48bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.60%Est @ 1.71%Est @ 1.79%Est @ 1.85%Est @ 1.89%Est @ 1.92% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$1.9kUS$1.9kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$927(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (10%– 2.0%) = US$30bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$11bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$25b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$65.6, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ONEOK as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.499. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ONEOKStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Oil and Gas industry.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

74,4a291e72-9896-3f96-9197-8ac300095dfd,CMCSA,2022-12-26,Death of the satellite dish puts Sky’s future in doubt,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/death-satellite-dish-puts-sky-120000457.html,1672056000,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Death of the satellite dish puts Sky’s future in doubtWhen the chief executive of Sky unveiled a new streaming-focused television, she vowed to transform the role TVs play in the home.“Just like a smartphone is more than a phone, Sky Glass is way more than a TV,” Dana Strong said at a glitzy launch party in east London in December.The launch of the product this month, which frees viewers from an unsightly satellite dish or set-top box, marked a key step forward in Sky’s efforts to carve out a new role in the changing media landscape.But as the fight for control of the living room intensifies, and the cost of living crisis puts consumer budgets under pressure, the broadcaster is facing questions over its future growth.When Sky first set up shop more than three decades ago, its satellite offering was revolutionary. But with the rise of streaming, the days of the dish are long gone and the media giant is increasingly being forced to respond.While the launch of Sky Glass sounded the death knell for the satellite, its demise was all but confirmed with the launch of Sky Stream – a set-top box that can be connected to existing TV systems.The moves reflect Sky’s efforts to establish itself as an aggregator, bringing together the farrago of different streaming services into one user-friendly platform.The stance is not only aimed at exhausted consumers, it also offers streaming platforms an antidote to the dreaded phenomenon of churn – or losing customers.François Godard, an analyst at Enders Analysis, says it’s a “compelling proposition” for the likes of Netflix and Disney.EVP and CEO UK &amp; Europe, Stephen Van Rooyen speaking in London at the official launch of Sky Glass - Matt Crossick/PAHowever, while its user-friendly principle has won applause, the first generation Sky Glass television itself has been met with lukewarm consumer reviews. Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, says the product is “poorly executed”, adding that Sky must now simplify its confused offering of Glass, Stream, Q and NOW.For Sky, there are bigger clouds on the horizon. US owner Comcast has written down its valuation by $8.6bn (£7.4bn) – roughly a quarter – just four years after buying it in a blockbuster $39bn deal.Story continuesThe company’s third-quarter sales plunged 14.7pc to $4.3bn, with the weak pound accounting for most of the decline. Meanwhile, deepening competition for eyeballs and consumer cutbacks due to the cost of living crisis mean the outlook has darkened.Internally, Sky has been rocked by high levels of recent turnover after staff were paid out bonuses following Comcast’s takeover, as well as broader dissatisfaction about the culture under the new owner.Stephen van Rooyen, the company's UK and Europe chief executive and architect of much of the growth and innovation that delivered the blockbuster sale price is the last of the senior old guard still at Sky. Even he is now speculated as a potential new boss of Vodafone.Much of the growth in Sky’s customer base comes from its mobile and broadband offerings, but the telecoms industry is also facing a squeeze.Media analyst Ian Whittaker says: “They are probably realising that we are not in a high subscriber growth market by any stretch of the imagination.”Content has long been Sky’s core offering, and after a significant hit during the pandemic the company will be hoping for a recovery in its crucial sports broadcasting business.It has also announced plans to double its annual production budget to £1bn. A spokesman said the company was “on track” to hit that target, with £500m of investment in the UK alone this year.However, competition from deep-pocketed streaming rivals continues to grow, with Apple widely tipped to make a foray into UK sports rights. In a further blow, Sky’s exclusive deal with HBO runs out in 2025, at which point the US company is expected to wrap the content into its own streaming service.There are also question marks over Sky News after boss John Ryley stepped down earlier this month. Commitments made by Comcast over the loss-making channel’s funding are due to run out in 2028.In other markets, too, Sky has struggled to replicate the success it has enjoyed in the UK. The group is said to be close to a sale of its German unit, while its Italian business has been struggling following the loss of crucial Serie A football rights to streaming rival DAZN.This leaves uncertainty over the group’s future direction, says François Godard at Enders. “That’s the most important issue now – how can they grow? They have proved that they are resilient and they are profitable, but where could growth come from?”House of the Dragon - Ollie Upton/APSome of the challenges facing Sky are industry-wide, and the company will be hoping its value as an aggregator will increase over time as the media landscape begins to settle.But the fundamental issue remains that without the satellite, Sky has lost its technological advantage, and its TV offering remains at the mercy of a launch from a rival such as Samsung.Sky executives maintain that the company has long been in the process of diversifying and that it does not take a “dogmatic” approach to the technology it uses.Sources pointed to SkyShowtime, a streaming joint venture between Comcast and ViacomCBS that brings NBC and Paramount content to viewers in 20 European markets. The company is also syndicating Glass with companies such as Foxtel in Australia, allowing it to reach customers in new markets.Still, step changes in viewing habits leave the company largely reliant on the strength of its brand. Bosses are said to have claimed that they can sell anything, and the group is now putting that to the test.Sky last month made a move into the insurance market, listing products on price comparison websites ahead of a full launch in the new year.The push into a new market highlights Sky’s efforts to squeeze more revenue out of its subscribers by targeting consumers in more areas of the home and combining various services into one bill.BT’s mobile network EE has made similar moves, teaming up with Verisure and Norton to offer home and cyber security services.Analyst Ian Whittaker describes this as the “Virgin strategy”, drawing a comparison with how Sir Richard Branson has leveraged the power of his brand.He adds: “If you want to characterise what their strategy is moving forwards, it’s essentially going to be to maximise the revenues from their existing customer base.”So as streaming subscriptions reach their peak, Sky will increasingly look to new areas. The company has already started to expand its offering to businesses through Sky Connect, and this could become a greater area of focus. Other new products harnessing the Sky brand are likely to follow the move into insurance.Or it may opt for a more radical step, such as a move into the lucrative gaming market. Analysts say this is possible, although it would require significant investment and Sky would likely have to team up with a producer to make it viable.Whatever approach the company chooses, however, one thing is clear. Much like its shiny Glass product, Sky will need to be about way more than TV.]"

In fact, in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries, all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy, where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.The U.S, on the other hand, saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies, and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However, this does not mean that prices are low, as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America, these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.However, these prices, which end up in massive profits for power producers, do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg, these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This, according to analysts, can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3,700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).Story continuesToday we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).16 Biggest Utility Companies in the U.S.Soonthorn Wongsaita/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe scoured through all U.S. based utility companies to sift out the top players and then ranked them according to their market capitalization.16 Biggest Utility Companies in the U.S.16.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.73bUS$4.04bUS$4.45bUS$4.92bUS$5.27bUS$5.56bUS$5.81bUS$6.03bUS$6.22bUS$6.40bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 7.10%Est @ 5.56%Est @ 4.49%Est @ 3.74%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.84% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$3.5kUS$3.6kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.4b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$146bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$146b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$79bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$115b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$67.1, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mondelez International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Mondelez InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity, ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption, petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise, industrial, transportation, and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S., and natural gas is the most widely used production source, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world, the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), an American firm, the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle, but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun, as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days, these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front, MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective, scalable, reliable, and efficient at the same time. To do this, they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.When talking about energy, any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions, fission and fusion. With the former, atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However, the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source, and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion, the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.Story continuesAdditionally, America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year, in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally, global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production, after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Today, we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms, with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and NextEra Energy, Inc.

The stock market will also be closed on Monday, December 26. Your next Market 360 article will be available on Tuesday, December 27. We hope you enjoy the long holiday weekend!With Christmas just a few days away, I want to share with you the best stocks for your portfolio stocking stuffers: energy stocks.You may be wondering, why not tech stocks? After all many are now trading at ultra-low prices, including big tech names like Amazon.com (AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Google Inc. (GOOG), which recently fell to new 52-week lows.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut here’s the reality: Technology and energy stocks’ weighting in the S&amp;P 500 is shifting.Just a year ago, energy accounted for less than 2% of the S&amp;P 500, while technology accounted for about 48%. I predict that energy stocks will account for 30% of the S&amp;P 500 in early 2025, as technology stocks fall to about 32%.So, as the weightings steadily change in the S&amp;P 500, the tracking manager crowd (i.e., closet indexers) will be systematically forced to buy more energy stocks as leading technology stocks falter. In other words, tracking managers will be a net buyer of energy stocks (given their strong earnings momentum) and a net seller of technology stocks.I should also add that, according to FactSet, the energy sector posted the best earnings growth in 2022, with earnings surging 151.7% in 2022.The fact of the matter is oil and natural gas companies will boast the strongest earnings and sales growth for the next several quarters – and positive results should dropkick and drive these stocks higher.So, if you want to give yourself a present this holiday season, you might want to consider the following four companies…Stocking Stuffer #1: ConocoPhillips (COP)ConocoPhillips (COP) is one of the largest independent exploration and production companies in the world. With an extensive energy portfolio that spans 14 countries, ConocoPhillips transports oil and natural gas around the world through its pipelines, as well as on tankers, trucks and rails. So, the company has profited from increased energy demand and rising prices.Story continuesDuring the third quarter, production rose to 1,754 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed). In turn, ConocoPhillips achieved adjusted earnings of $4.6 billion, or $3.60 per share, or 91.7% year-over-year earnings growth. The consensus estimate called for adjusted earnings of $3.44 per share.For the fourth quarter, earnings are forecast to grow 41.9% year-over-year to $3.22 per share. Revenue is anticipated to rise 16.5% year-over-year to $18.59 billion.Stocking Stuffer #2: Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC)Marathon Petroleum (MPC) operates the biggest refining system in the U.S., with 13 refineries capable of refining about 2.9 million barrels per day.In addition to its refining business, Marathon Petroleum also operates a network of pipelines, terminals and barges. Its midstream business is primarily the operations of its master limited partnership MPLX, which distributes, markets, stores and transports crude oil and refined products, as well as processes and transports natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also produces asphalt, feedstocks and petrochemicals.In the third quarter, Marathon Petroleum reported that revenue rose 41.7% year-over-year to $45.79 billion, topping estimates for $31.92 billion. Third-quarter earnings jumped 731.2% year-over-year to $4.48 billion, or $9.06 per share, up from $694 million, or $1.09 per share. Adjusted earnings per share were $7.81, which beat estimates for $7.07 per share by 10.5%.Analysts’ fourth-quarter earnings estimates have nearly doubled in the past three months. Estimates now call for fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $5.82 per share. Revenue is expected to rise 6.1% year-over-year to $37.78 billion.Stocking Stuffer #3: Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO) operated in several of the top oil and natural gas-producing regions in the U.S., with operations in Eagle Ford, Bakken Shale, the Permian Basin and STACK/SCOOP. The company anticipates that it will produce between 285 million and 290 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed) this year.Given third-quarter operational results, Marathon Oil is well on its way to achieving this goal: Third-quarter production totaled 295,000 Mboed. Oil production accounted for 166,000 million barrels.Marathon Oil also reported third-quarter adjusted earning of $832 million, or $1.24 per share, and revenue of $2.25 billion, which represented 168.4% year-over-year earnings growth and 54.6% year-over-year revenue growth. The consensus estimate called for adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share on $2.02 billion in revenue.Stocking Stuffer #4: Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) has provided energy exploration and petrochemical manufacturing services for more than 100 years. The company has energy and chemical assets around the world, including in the U.S., Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Here in the U.S., Occidental Petroleum has operations in the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico.In the third quarter, Occidental Petroleum produced 1,180 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed). Total U.S. production was 944 Mboed in the third quarter. During the first nine months of the year, the company achieved total production of 1,136 Mboed, with 902 Mboed in the U.S.Given the strong operational results, Occidental Petroleum posted robust third-quarter results.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Norfolk SouthernIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Director, James Squires, sold US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$246 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$248. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 18% of James Squires's holding.Insiders in Norfolk Southern didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Norfolk Southern better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Norfolk Southern Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Norfolk Southern. In total, Director James Squires sold US$5.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Norfolk Southern Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that Norfolk Southern insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$58m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The Norfolk Southern Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Norfolk Southern stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Norfolk Southern makes money, and is growing profits. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Norfolk Southern you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

85,71f0914d-47ff-39f4-b28b-9a425e328cdc,KO,2022-12-26,The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 62% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-130041600.html,1672059641,STORY,['KO'],"[If you want to know who really controls The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 62% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Coca-Cola. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Coca-Cola already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Coca-Cola's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Coca-Cola. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.4% and 7.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Coca-Cola Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.8b worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 29% stake in Coca-Cola. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 9.2% of the Coca-Cola shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Coca-Cola has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

87,0ece4515-40c4-3a49-a16e-786a0040b2f4,DVA,2022-12-26,Why DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) Looks Like A Quality Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-davita-inc-nyse-dva-145215732.html,1671979935,STORY,['DVA'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for DaVita How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for DaVita is:44% = US$904m ÷ US$2.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.44 in profit.Does DaVita Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, DaVita has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Healthcare industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for DaVita by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesDaVita's Debt And Its 44% ROEIt seems that DaVita uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 4.25. Its ROE is clearly quite good, but it seems to be boosted by the significant use of debt by the company.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: DaVita may not be the best stock to buy.

88,8be4156e-36e0-358e-9085-5658cd0cabee,SRE,2022-12-26,17 Biggest Energy Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/17-biggest-energy-companies-us-153102714.html,1671982262,STORY,"['SRE', 'VLO', 'EPD', 'SO', 'PXD', 'EOG', 'CVX', 'PSX', 'HES', 'NEE-PR', 'OXY', 'SLB', 'D', 'XOM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 17 biggest energy companies in the U.S. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Energy Companies in the U.S. America is one of the world's most industrialized regions, with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity, ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption, petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise, industrial, transportation, and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S., and natural gas is the most widely used production source, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world, the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), an American firm, the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle, but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun, as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days, these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front, MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective, scalable, reliable, and efficient at the same time. To do this, they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.When talking about energy, any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions, fission and fusion. With the former, atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However, the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source, and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion, the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.Story continuesAdditionally, America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year, in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally, global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production, after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Today, we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms, with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and NextEra Energy, Inc.

But it has accelerated the process as importing and maintaining equipment in Russia has became much harder since Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, and the West responded with unprecedented sanctions.Siemens Energy, General Electric, and Alstom, whose turbines were used to built modern gas power plants in Russia, are either withdrawing from the Russian market or have already suspended operations.In addition to Power Machines, Russian state firm United Engine Corporation has said it plans to manufacture two high-power turbines a year by 2023 and four by 2025.""The powerful turbine, which was assembled and tested at our test facility, is living proof that we are on the right track and that our goal will be achieved: Russia will have its own gas turbines, will have its own technology with full localisation,"" Alexander Konyukhov, head of Power Machines, was quoted as saying in the statement.

This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity, ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption, petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise, industrial, transportation, and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S., and natural gas is the most widely used production source, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world, the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), an American firm, the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle, but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun, as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days, these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front, MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective, scalable, reliable, and efficient at the same time. To do this, they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.When talking about energy, any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions, fission and fusion. With the former, atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However, the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source, and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion, the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.Story continuesAdditionally, America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year, in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally, global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production, after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Today, we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms, with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and NextEra Energy, Inc.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in LKQ's (NASDAQ:LKQ) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for LKQ, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$1.4b ÷ (US$12b - US$2.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, LKQ has an ROCE of 15%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 15%. See our latest analysis for LKQ roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for LKQ compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is LKQ's ROCE Trending?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at LKQ. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 15%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 23% more capital is being employed now too. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.In Conclusion...All in all, it's terrific to see that LKQ is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Considering the stock has delivered 35% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.Story continuesOn a final note, we found  3 warning signs for LKQ (1 is concerning)  you should be aware of.While LKQ may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

92,24eb76ed-76ba-3cc5-9178-184cd17096c8,EL,2022-12-26,The Price Is Right For The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/price-est-e-lauder-companies-120025390.html,1672056025,STORY,['EL'],"[The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.'s (NYSE:EL) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 39.3x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Estée Lauder Companies could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies peKeen to find out how analysts think Estée Lauder Companies' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Estée Lauder Companies' to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 27% decrease to the company's bottom line. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 18% in total. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 13% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.3% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why Estée Lauder Companies is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesThe Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.As we suspected, our examination of Estée Lauder Companies' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.It is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for Estée Lauder Companies that you need to take into consideration.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

As economies were crawling back to normalcy, the Russia-Ukraine war triggered fresh concerns for several sectors of the economy. The war catalyzed an increase in the list of battered stocks in 2022.With the Russia-Ukraine war, oil prices surged, translating into broad-based inflation for the global economy. While commodity producers benefited, the consumers of commodities were impacted. The war has also resulted in supply chain headwinds, contributing to higher inflation.Among battered stocks, some companies had meaningful exposure to Russia. This includes companies with retail operations or companies having commodity assets. I believe that most of the concerns related to the Russia-Ukraine war have been discounted in these stocks. I remain cautiously optimistic.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s talk about three battered stocks since the Russia-Ukraine war began.TickerCompanyPriceCCLCarnival Corporation$7.95KGCKinross Gold$4.08PEPPepsiCo$180.97Carnival Corporation (CCL)Carnival (CCL) logo sign in the night at their headquarters in Miami, Florida, USA. Carnival Cruise Line is an international cruise line.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comCarnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) stock was struggling due to the pandemic. The company had over-leveraged and diluted equity to stay afloat. Just as the recovery began, Carnival faced the headwind of the Russia-Ukraine war. For year-to-date 2022, CCL stock has plunged by 62%. It seems likely that the challenging environment will continue for the company in 2023.An immediate impact of the Russia-Ukraine was a surge in fuel prices. It’s worth noting that Carnival reported revenue of $8.3 billion for the first nine months of 2022. However, EBITDA-level losses have been sustained.Another impact of the war is on the global supply chain and trade. There are several reasons to expect a recession in 2023; the war is one of the catalysts. A possible recession will impact cruise travel, and cash burn might sustain in the coming years. As credit metrics remain stressed, CCL stock will remain subdued.Story continuesKinross Gold (KGC)Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comThe war has also compelled several businesses to exit from Russia. The losses have been meaningful as the exit can be likened to distressed asset sales.Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) has been among the victims of the war. In April, it was reported that Kinross would be selling its gold mining assets in Russia for a consideration of $680 million. However, the Russian sub-commission on controlling foreign investments approved the transaction for only $340 million.First, KGC stock was impacted due to lower-than-expected cash inflow from the asset sale. Furthermore, the company’s production guidance for the coming years was impacted.Regardless, these factors have already been discounted in the stock price. KGC stock looks attractive, with a strong cash buffer and steady production visibility for the next few years. Notably, the company has guided for free cash flows even if gold trades around $1,700 to $1,800 an ounce.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockPepsiCo’s (NASDAQ:PEP) stock is not among the names that have plunged. However, it’s worth talking about Pepsi for two reasons. The company was one of the longest-operating U.S. businesses in Russia. Furthermore, Russia was the second largest international market for the company, after Mexico.I also wanted to talk about Pepsi because the company is expected to eliminate hundreds of jobs in North America.
