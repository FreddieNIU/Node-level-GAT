SWHGX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSWHGX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab MarketTrack Growth Investor debuted in November of 1995. Since then, SWHGX has accumulated assets of about $871 million, according to the most recently available information. Zifan Tang is the fund's current manager and has held that role since February of 2012.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 5.8%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 5.88%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SWHGX's standard deviation comes in at 17.56%, compared to the category average of 17.17%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 15.37% compared to the category average of 15.01%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.81, which means it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. SWHGX's 5-year performance has produced a negative alpha of -3.23, which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWHGX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.39% compared to the category average of 0.86%. So, SWHGX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab MarketTrack Growth Investor ( SWHGX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.Want even more information about SWHGX?

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, sold US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$69.43 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$82.22, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.2% of Charles Schwab's holding.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Charles Schwab shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Charles Schwab. In total, insiders dumped US$46m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Charles Schwab insiders own 6.4% of the company, currently worth about US$9.8b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Charles Schwab Tell Us?Insiders sold Charles Schwab shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, Charles Schwab makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Charles Schwab has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.But note: Charles Schwab may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.11%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 6.67%.Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 4.98% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 6.38%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.4%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Texas Instruments as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.97, down 13.22% from the prior-year quarter.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

6,54feb072-ce6e-3995-9f97-fa32a2cacdce,TXN,2022-12-28,Chip glut has prices coming down while ‘chipmakers are hurting’: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/chip-glut-prices-coming-down-220154504.html,1672178514,VIDEO,"['NVDA', 'QCOM', 'TXN', 'MU', 'AMD', 'SOXX', 'INTC']","[Futurum Research Principal Analyst Daniel Newman joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on how chipmakers are grappling with a glut of supply following a major shortage throughout the height of the coronavirus pandemic.Video TranscriptPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: After a pandemic shortage that drove up the prices of everything from cars to dishwashers, chip makers around the globe are contending with the glut of supply. Here to break it down is Futurum Research principal analyst Daniel Newman. Daniel, so we saw Micron claiming its inventories are now well above target levels. What exactly happened here with this chip glut?DANIEL NEWMAN: Well, just like we ended up in a shortage, nobody really expected so much demand to come on so quickly. And chipmakers weren't able to ramp up the inventory quickly enough. And so as that demand kind of swelled and stayed intact for more than a year following the initial pandemic, as people bought cars, gaming consoles, PC, servers in the data center, the same thing happened on the way down. We saw what happened with the Fed.We raised rates. We see we're heading into a recession. Discretionary income is down. People's balance sheets at home are not as good as they were. And all of a sudden, all these companies that ramped up have all this extra inventory. And effectively, we don't have the demand we had. And so now the inventory is there, and prices are coming down, and chipmakers are hurting.SEANA SMITH: And Daniel, we certainly have seen a number of chip makers respond and start to shift their operations or how they're approaching business over the coming quarters. Micron cutting 10% of its workforce as that demand drops. When it comes to these inventory levels, the fact that they are so swelled at this point, how long until those inventory levels, I guess, get to more appropriate or what is, I guess, considered a historic norm?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, we're hearing different things from different leaders in these companies. We've heard from Nvidia's leadership that it should be some time at the end of this quarter, which, for them, ends in January. We heard Sanjay Mehrotra of Micron say probably in the second half of this year. I think some of the specificity is going to go around, whether are they data center chips, are they automotive chips, are they gaming consoles, are they PCs.Story continuesEach of these have their own sort of boom and bust cycles, but of course, we're seeing sort of an overall bust cycle right now. I like the chip companies that are more centric to things like cloud data center and automotive. And those that are really heavily into gaming and PC, I think a lot of their demand got pulled forward. And you could see it a longer time. So that's why Mehrotra said second half of this year, Nvidia's gaming chips, parts of Intel and AMD, they're probably looking at second half or later before they really start to see normal demand come back.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Daniel, so I covered the auto sector. And we're still seeing a lot of the chip crunch happening there across a number of automakers. You mentioned that it's specific to different sectors. What is it about these chips that the auto sector needs is just-- is not-- the industry is not actually pumping out enough of them?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, it's really interesting. The automotive sector depends a lot on these lagging edge semiconductors, which is 14 nanometer and above. These are often produced by the likes of Tower Semiconductors, GlobalFoundries. A lot of what we're hearing, the resiliency, the fabs being built are more of these newer leading edge. These are the 5 and 7 nanometer process.So what's happened is we have all this demand peaking for automotive. You've got cars now that have more semiconductors in them than ever before, but we haven't really increased the production of capabilities like we're doing, and we haven't finished yet, but on a lot of these leading edge with the CHIPS Act. So we don't have the production capabilities to kind of get up to all this demand we had for automotive. And so we're still seeing car prices are still pretty high. Used car demand is still a little bit swelled. And all these chip makers are going to need to keep ramping up production to ever catch up on these automotive designs that are semiconductor intensive.SEANA SMITH: Daniel, we heard from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger back in October. And he said, quote, ""It's just hard to see any points of good news on the horizon."" We know that Intel then issued a muted outlook. They also announced job cuts. Do you see is there any reason to be optimistic about this sector heading into the new year?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, if you zoom out overall, it's really hard to see a world that isn't going to be accelerated by technology, whether that's supercomputing in AI. Whether that's the next generation of vehicles, data centers and the cloud, and the software that enterprises run to operate, all these things require semiconductors. Over the next 12 months, during a tight recessionary period, I believe companies are going to try to do more with what they have technology wise, which means less buying of PCs and servers, which means a tougher outlook in the short-term.But in the long run, the amount of software, the digitalization of everything means more semiconductors. You really got to follow those boom and bust cycles. We are in a bust cycle that was accelerated by a crazy boom. But the semiconductor tends to run pretty closely with those economic up and downs. I think as we start to come out of this economic downturn, you'll see the semiconductor volume pick up in a big way, as it's going to be critical to the advancement of our infrastructure and of business.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Daniel, so do you think that the CHIPS Act will kind of help that boom-bust, smooth it out a bit more? And who can really actually benefit in terms of the companies from that act?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, some of this demand planning, the supply chain issues that we have, the hyperdependency we've created with Taiwan, I mean, we definitely put ourselves in a bit of a difficult situation. We, of course, have great relations with Taiwan, but there's a lot of microaggression going on with China that's creating some discomfort. We've got some new tariffs and some new regulatory policy going against certain chips shipping over to China.We need to bring more production here to the United States. We need to bring more production on the leading edge. We need to bring more, as I mentioned with automotive, on some of those lagging, older process technologies, 14 nanometer and above. I think Intel has got the biggest opportunity to benefit. But we're seeing Micron, IBM. I mean, TSMC is reaching out for money. And all the fabless companies can benefit from some of the dollars that are there for innovation, R&amp;D, and design in the extension of the CHIPS and Sciences Act.But I like Intel's prospects. If they can get policymakers behind them, this could be a good moment for Intel. But of course, TSMC has had so much success. It'll be interesting to see does our government back the Taiwanese manufacturer to do more leading edge here, or does more dollars go to Intel, which may be a good idea for the national security and resiliency that we are needing in the future.SEANA SMITH: Certainly a number of stories to keep an eye on when it comes to the chip sector in 2020. Daniel Newman, as always, thanks so much for joining us here this afternoon.]"

Visa is undoubtedly faced with a number of near-term challenges, but it is well positioned for long-term growth on the back of numerous buyouts and alliances. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payment to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.The gradual revival of the global economy will keep driving consumer spending, expanding V's business volumes in turn.

8,616c6569-78db-3a88-819f-3998703283f3,TXN,2022-12-28,Texas Instruments' (NASDAQ:TXN) investors will be pleased with their notable 78% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-nasdaq-txn-investors-110022683.html,1672138822,STORY,['TXN'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) share price is up 56% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 38% (ignoring dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Texas Instruments managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Texas Instruments has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Texas Instruments, it has a TSR of 78% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Texas Instruments returned a loss of 12% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 23%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 12% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Texas Instruments better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Texas Instruments (at least 2 which are significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

PRAA is well-poised to grow on the back of its strategic buyouts and Europe operations. The company’s ability to work with different types of debt will help with diversification.PRA Group, with a market cap of $1.3 billion, is a global financial and business services company in the Americas, Australia and Europe. Its primary business involves the purchase, collection and management of portfolios of non-performing loans.Courtesy of solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth holding on to at the moment.Trend in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PRA Group’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $2.80 per share, which has been unchanged over the past week. Our estimate suggests the metric to be at $2.73 per share. During this time, it has witnessed no movement in estimate revisions. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 40.3%.PRA Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PRA Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePRA Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PRA Group, Inc. QuoteThe consensus estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $960.3 million, while our estimate suggests the metric to be $953.9 million.Key DriversPRA Group’s Europe investments are becoming better over time. Europe’s insolvency is expected to improve going ahead. Europe Core’s cash collection on a constant-currency basis improved 2.2% year over year in the third quarter. A recovery of higher degree will likely help the company’s Europe operations.Current market volatility and economic pressures affecting consumers might lead to higher charge-offs. This will create buying opportunities for companies like PRA Group and benefit in the long run. The economic environment in 2023 will likely play a major role in PRAA’s efforts to find the supply of new receivables.PRA Group’s ability to work with different types of debt will likely be a crucial driver in the coming days. While credit card charge-offs can help the company to generate a significant amount of cash, its programs focusing on other types of debts will help the company in the long term with diversification.Story continuesIts moves to reduce costs through diverting legal cash collections to in-house operators can boost profits. Digital collections are expected to help the company raise its margins. Our estimate suggests total operating expenses for 2022 to decline 6.1% from the 2021 reported level.Strategic buyouts bode well for the company’s inorganic growth. PRAA increased its footfall in Northern Europe and South America with prudent acquisitions. Taking its presence beyond the primary debt collection business, and stepping into government collections and audit services was a wise move by the management.PRA Group’s disciplined capital management is praiseworthy. This helped the company continue its capital deployment activities. It bought back shares worth $25 million in the third quarter. There was an available repurchase capacity of $68 million as of Sep 30, 2022.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that can hold the stock back. The longer the company has to wait for acquiring quality receivables, its revenues will continue declining. Its efforts to increase margins will provide some respite during the tough times.The stock currently has a forward 12-month price to earnings of 16.19X, higher than the industry average of 10.45X, making it overvalued. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are MGIC Investment Corporation MTG, Unum Group UNM and NerdWallet, Inc.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 6.54, while its industry has an average P/E of 11.93. UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.46 and as low as 4.76, with a median of 6.39, all within the past year.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is UNM's P/B ratio of 0.95. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.57. Over the past year, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.44, with a median of 0.67.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.68. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.92.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.65. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. UNM's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 6.41. Over the past 52 weeks, UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.63 and as low as 4.67, with a median of 5.69.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Unum Group is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, UNM feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TMO) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Thermo Fisher Scientific’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What's The Opportunity In Thermo Fisher Scientific?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 34%, trading at US$545 compared to my intrinsic value of $408.25. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like Thermo Fisher Scientific’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from Thermo Fisher Scientific?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 28% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Thermo Fisher Scientific. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TMO’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe TMO should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TMO for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for TMO, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

The value of the retailer’s stock is decreasing, and their third-quarter earnings were disappointing.Take a Look Back: 2022 Year in ReviewLearn: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Target is considered a store for higher-income shoppers than say Walmart, for example, so in the wake of inflation, many shoppers switched from Target to Walmart for their needs. “Amid high inflation, shoppers are opting to trade down to cheaper retailers, brands, and products. Walmart has noted how it has been seeing shoppers with a household income of $100,000+ devote a greater share of their wallet to Walmart, boosting their results,” Tim Campbell, Director of Insights at CommerceIQ, said.But, how has this impacted Target shoppers? GOBankingRates talked to experts to see how Target consumers were affected, and what they can expect to see in 2023.Excess Inventory Leads to Big DiscountsExcess inventory was a huge problem for Target this year, however, that translated to good news for consumers. If you saw incredible deals–especially for the holidays, that’s due to a surplus of inventory the retailer had. Because of the extra inventory, customers might have seen more mess in terms of aisle organization, but Campbell says that’s probably going to be cleaned up next year. “The inventory glut at Target caused by overly optimistic forecasts for growth in discretionary goods in 2022 will likely be fully resolved in 2023, so shoppers can expect to see more orderly stores with better merchandising.”As for low prices, Campbell says consumers will still benefit from those in 2023, especially from Target’s brands. Look for big deals from all 45 of Target’s private label brands including A New Day, Market Pantry, Cat &amp; Jack, Room Essentials, Everspring, Good &amp; Gather, up &amp; up, and Universal Thread, to name a few.Take Our Poll: Do You Think Student Loan Debt Should Be Forgiven?Don’t Expect Discounts on FoodThough consumers can look forward to Target reducing the cost of clothing and electronics, if you’re shopping for groceries, you won’t see much of a price reduction. During times of inflation, consumers tend to cut out discretionary spending, but they still need groceries. Target reported that their food and beverage sales surpassed every other category of spending in 2022. Needless to say, they don’t have to slash prices for customers to buy, so there probably won’t be any major sales.Story continuesPaper Coupons Aren’t Always Accepted AnymoreIf you were relying on coupons to shop at Target, you might want to switch to digital ones only, as it will be a bit more difficult to use your paper ones. Recently, due to an increase in fraudulent coupons, Target now only accepts coupons that can be validated through their master file of barcodes. Because of this, customers have reported that their paper coupons are getting rejected more frequently than before.Your best bet is to use Target coupons you find in the Target app, as those are automatically valid, and don’t have to be checked against the database of barcodes.More In-Store Displays Elevate Shopping ExperienceIn spite of the rising cost of goods, Target made it a point to stand out among the competition with engaging in-store displays. “Despite recessionary trends, Target remains committed to remodels that upgrade the look and feel of their in-store experience,” Campbell said, citing Target’s partnership with Ulta as an example. Customers looking to try before they buy will find a lot of opportunity to do so inside the Target stores.Target Expected To Continue To Appeal to High-Income ShoppersAs Campbell discussed, Target caters to a customer within a certain income bracket. Surprisingly, even after a lackluster year, the retailer has no plans to try and rebrand who they appeal to. Though there will continue to be a lot of sales, Target will still offer goods that other retailers just won’t. ​​For example, the company recently announced a partnership with British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer to sell a limited-time assortment of gourmet premium food and chocolates. It’s items like those that will continue to set Target apart as the retailer hopes to hold onto its spot as a store for higher income shoppers. Technology Industry Analyst Jeff Kagan says if they can do that, they’ll survive. “Target wants and needs a strong economy and low inflation to flourish and grow as a whole. However, they are more insulated from tough economic times compared to some of their competitors who have [lower income] shoppers.”Going into 2023, keep an eye out for the best sales by using the Target app, and expect prices on clothing and electronics to stay lower for a while.More From GOBankingRatesZelle Scams on Facebook Marketplace: How To Recognize and Avoid ThemTake a Look Back: 2022 Year in ReviewThe 10 Best Cash Back Credit Cards for 20236 Best Ways to Help You Keep Your Identity and Credit SafeThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Did Inflation Affect Target Shoppers in 2022?]"

(OTC:BLGO) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript November 16, 2022Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the BioLargo Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Brian Loper. Sir, the floor is yours.Brian Loper: Great. Thank you, operator. Yes, so this is Q3 2022 earnings results conference call. By now, everyone should have had access to the earnings press release, which was issued yesterday before market open. And the quarterly report filed with the SEC. And this call is being webcast and is available for replay. In our remarks today, we may include statements that are considered forward-looking within the meanings of securities laws, including forward-looking statements about future results of operations, business strategies and plans, our relationships with our customers, market and potential growth opportunities. In addition, management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current knowledge and expectations as of today, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and may cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.Water Treatmentivan-bandura-Ac97OqAWDvg-unsplashA detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties are contained in our most recent Form 10-K, 10-Q and in other reports filed with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll now hand the call over to BioLargo's, Chief Executive Officer, Dennis Calvert.Dennis Calvert: Hey, Brian, thank you very much for that introduction and covering the preliminaries. I want to thank everyone for joining us. We're going to cover a lot of information as usual. And there's a lot going on at BioLargo. So this would be pack full of Intel, and we look forward to the question-and-answer as well. This is a great quarter for a number of reasons, it's probably one of the best quarters and the best period of time in the history of the company as we watch our technology spine market adoption, we see the fruits of these planting seeds for almost a decade, bearing out fruit of significance. And we think that, that trend will continue. And it's a great time to do a deep dive in the company, and we're going to highlight the key revenue generators and some ideas about where we think this is going in the near-term future.Story continuesSo we got a little bit of information for new people that are just learning about the company. We're going to try to cover a high level. And again, we love a deep dive at another time. There's really -- there's a number of subsidiaries. BioLargo started as a technology developer, and evolve to become a whole service solution provider. And within the portfolio of innovations, there's really two major groups; there's three subsidiaries, BioLargo Engineering, BioLargo Water, Millennium Environmental, all of which are focused on environmental that we internally call it, the Environmental Group. They very much work hand-in-hand, where one leaves off another picks up, they complement each other quite well. And then we have a medical subsidiary, Clyra Medical, that's been an incubation and development for a number of years.It's just finding its first customer base. It's got a clearance through 510(k) clearance to the FDA. A significant investment has gone into making those assets ready for market, and we think the future for Clyra is quite bright. And we'll speak a little bit about that at the end of the presentation. We're often asked, what does BioLargo do? Before we head into the financial results, the best way to describe the company really is this innovator solution provider, focused on clean air, clean water, cleaner earth, bringing technology-based solutions to bear in the marketplace with this attitude of service and the solution providers, a mentality to work with clients to bring the best-of-class solution. And many times, in many cases, that represents our technology.And in some others, it does not. And I think what's unusual about the business is that we have the ability to serve well, served with excellent results at fair pricing, and we're finding incredible traction with that type of service offering in the marketplace. This last quarter marks another significant revenue turtle, about $1.5 million came in as reported. Note that we've seen a steady increase. Those numbers are becoming more and more meaningful. And I think what's really exciting about this curve is the steepness of, by which revenues continue to climb. And we think that they can continue that way. We're going to talk about why we think that? Some of the assumptions and some of the things that we know inside the company, we'd like to share with you to get a glimpse of how we see the future unfolding.But we do think that trend is, as we say, scratching the surface and it will continue. And the other is debt. We just almost have such a minimal amount of data, SBA loan and a line of credit with Clyra, small fixed price convertible at $50,000, I mean, in a PPP, right? It's such a negligible amount, it's almost meaningless, and we intend to keep it that way. We relied on equity financing to get us through the last few years, and we intend to continue so. And we just think it's just a wonderful time to focus on really driving revenues, driving value and driving enterprise value for the performance of our stock. Okay. A lot of this information is also in the press release, but let's talk about it a little bit. It's insightful. It will help, right?So, top line revenue is $1.5 million year-to-date, $3.786 billion. That's about 13% quarter-over-quarter and 111% year-over-year, top line revenue growth. That's exciting. Again, as we say, we're proud and not satisfied. We think there's a lot more to come, especially as some of the innovations that we've created to find marketplace and channel partner adoption in the marketplace. We're going to see those revenues continue. But it's not bad. We're pleased to report, I think the adoption cycle is demonstrating that the technologies have a home, and with the addition of channel partners, which is quite extensive, we think the future bodes well. The Engineering Group, for the third quarter, had a decrease in top line revenue. Let's talk about that for a minute.That demonstrates the lumpiness, if you will, of the cycle at which they provide services to customers. As they get more of the technology-based assets like equipment heated in the market that will even out, we also think that given the new contracts that are coming for services and the significance of the financial numbers that will also even out that lumpiness. But in Q2, we completed Phase 1 of two projects. One is the Waste Energy project in South America, and the second is the Ultra Safe Nuclear project for Phase 1 design. Both of those concluded, and then there's a gap, which is kind of normal. After that gap occurs, we then head into the negotiation, the pricing, the scoping of Phase 2, and we expect in both those cases, the revenues to rise significantly as we enter into Phase 2.The odds are those Phase 2 contracts will execute in Q1 2023. It's what we expect. It's not guaranteed, of course, but that's what we've been told by our clients. We're preparing for that. We're in the process of pricing, scoping and planning the workload, because it will be quite a bit of work to deliver those services. The thing to note about that is that we still have yet to see some of the significant assets deployed in the marketplace, which create recurring revenue and margin, namely the AEC, the AOS, the Garratt-Callahan minimum liquid discharge system. And so at the baseline of 283 to 300, that represents services, that's consulting only working with clients. In addition, the engineering group also does quite a bit of work to support the national office for innovation, support our old legacy technologies signing in the way to market and scale up and then, of course, they're innovating themselves on things like the AEC.So, there's quite a bit of R&amp;D going on as well. O&amp;M, absolutely breaking records. I think the biggest highlight is that true-up a net operating income of $400,000. The way I think about that as CEO of the company, as I look at that and I say that business unit to carry the whole company. That's the way I think about it. As it continues to thrive and expand with the great production what's going on with POOPH and that expansion, which we're going to talk about in detail, that operating unit has a chance really to generate such meaningful revenues and margin that it could put us in a cash flow positive scenario in a relatively short period of time. Now, there's a lot of work to do there. So, we're going to talk about what that means to get to that spot, but we can see it coming, and that's the beauty of having -- watching this performance happen.The other thing about this performance with POOPH that I think is really critical is to note that it's an example of the business model that we set forth at the inception of the company. And of course, it took a lot of money, a lot of time to get to the spot. But to now watch and see and experience technology adoption at a mass scale and what it can do financially for the company is what we planned and envisioned since inception. And so as I say, all the things that we said we're doing are coming through, and that's great news. That is absolutely great news. So, again, year-over-year, 185% -- excuse me, 130 -- yes. You look at that real quick. One second here. I'll make sure you got it right. Yes, here we go. Little technical -- yes 136% year-over-year $2.49 million.So, this is going to put us in a run rate that should come in the end of the year over $5 million, which we're very excited about. That will represent a 100% increase year-over-year for the entity. And that seems to be in line with what we'd expect given the growth curve. And Q4 is out to a great start as well. Nothing is occurring that gives us any fear. It's just a lot of work, and it's got our team really maxed to the gills to support our customers. Let me go to the next slide. When you look at the key catalysts for the company, we've been talking about this for the last year and now we're watching it happen. So, POOPH, of course, in many ways, is considered the largest, the Ikigai relationship that launched POOPH is bearing fruit extraordinary, a great relationship.And then, of course, Garratt-Callahan is preparing to launch -- we do have customers in the queue that are not signed yet. We'll talk about the detail on those assets. But those three drivers represent a significant massive opportunity across all three and we believe that they will continue to expand and grow and generate kind of revenue and potential cash flow that we're looking for. The AEC, again, it's a little bit of history. The AEC is the Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator, that's a device that started development about three years ago. It's now got its first customer in a project to do a custom design for a very large industrial client. We estimate that that project at scale will come in somewhere between $5 million and $7.5 million over the course of the year.We are in the process of scoping Phase II now. Scoping Phase II means making recommendations to our clients about how best to get to the end goal with realistic timing, budget and execution benchmarks. We're doing that now. We're very excited about that. That's a chance to showcase this technology. It has three key features. It's real simple, saves customers money, it works on all types of different waters. And at the end of the day, its environmental impact is so low that have compelling value propositions to compete in the open market with incumbents. I'll also note that the first project that we've been engaged for is a project that's designed to replace an incumbent carbon-based system. The customer was just within over the implications and the cost of managing that system, and we're seeking an alternative.We're coming behind a prior install to swap it out for our technical solutions. So we're very excited about that. In this field, our work in PFAS is dramatic. Most people look at it, and say, it's probably one of the largest opportunities in the portfolio. And we've got some big ones. So that's saying a lot. A couple of things have happened. One is we've started a testing program. We had great response. We've tested a number of clients' water. And in each case, we're having significant statistical results for performance, great results, even including a non-detect status, which is a remarkable plan. That means we've removed PFAS, as PFAS, listed for forever chemicals, that were using non-stick coatings for over 40 years, widely considering the containment of the decade, if not the century.And we have a technical solution to bring those out of water and soil, mostly water by running them through our system, attracting the PFAS to its opposite charge, selecting on a membrane in what's called selective isolation. We selectively isolate and collect the PFAS in such a significant easy, fast way. It allows us to highly concentrate and create a small footprint for disposal. In these images, there's a couple of things to note. The unit on the left is really a demo type unit. The upper right is a small rack and then now at the bottom is a large. That's 1,000 gallons per minute design, 1,000 gallons a minute. So notice that's about six feet tall, and maybe 18 feet or 20 long. It's a small building. And if you think about large municipal projects and you had something like 2,500 gallons or a 3,000 gallons a minute, it's a very high flow rate, it would be one, two or three of those, you stack them up and you spread the water and you do the work.So what we're demonstrating is that we have the ability to go to full scale, and the next slide is a good illustration of what that unit looks like. So just -- yes, so PFAS, a couple of things, I want to show you that picture in just a second. A couple of things about our current activity. The first is, I think, we start with the last one. We really are becoming recognized experts across the country. And you say, well, how do you do that, right? Well, you got to remember, first of all, our engineers have been doing remediation work for 30 years. So they are experts. There's no question. Then we hired time to Tonya Chandler. Tonya is an expert in the water industry. 22 years in the field, working at the highest level, all over the country and internationally.And such a deep experience, and we committed as a company -- as she committed as an executive to become expert at the regulatory, decisions that are being made at the highest level of state and federal, understand what those regulatory decisions mean for now plus the future where they are headed, anticipating the future, and then helping customers and technology providers discern what the future holds from a regulatory perspective and make choices about technology. Well, that's a lot. That's incredibly valuable and we do that as a service to teach the marketplace about making decisions that are not based on this year, but they're based on a year or two and three years out, because the scope of regulatory enforcement is so aggressive and so wide sweeping.The way we would say it is, we don't believe any segment of the market is going to be untouched by the impact of regulatory enforcement on PFAS. We've even heard the EPA's make comments. There's no safe level of PFAS that's tolerable, right? Okay. So what does that mean? It means that, there's a lot of heat on anywhere that they're finding concentrations for sure  even  and even small dosing, because of the concern that is linked to adverse health effects like birth defects and cancer. It's not good. So what have we done? We've become experts at teaching, sharing, explaining why we make the decisions we make. We think they're really rational and it's a good strategy to be the most efficient collector. We're rolling that technology out in our first custom operation.We've got a number of other early adopters coming to us as customers, which we're very excited about. And then, we've also built a sales rep network that virtually covers the whole country now. And it's early, right? So there's a lot of courtship and education that goes on to get those reps trained, so that they can represent this actively. But it will give us a national footprint, and a significant reach to the front line of the marketplace. The thing about the rep network is very important to understand is that, these are reps that have been doing what they do for 10 to 15 and 20, 30 years. They're highly technical people that are on the front line serving customers with excellence and looking to bring solutions to bear that, the customers are yearning for.The way we would characterize PFAS or BioLargo is we've tapped a nerve. We've tapped the nerve. When we present our value proposition, people listen  so  and that we didn't in a whole number  a number of ways that are really important. We're being  there's a number of future articles that are being prepared that will come out and trade for us. We're being asked to speak at regional national conferences, we're being asked to even educate engineers, right, continued education requirements for their certifications to help them understand, right? How this impacts them at the local level, because it's moving so fast at the national level, it's hard to keep up. It takes the company's dedication to be expert in someone like calmly to actually pull it off.And so we're doing quite well. It's a very exciting piece of the business. Here's the images. The images are important. These are new  we have three of these. We just got  just built and what will happen with these machines is they go out into the field where we go through early testing program. We identify a spot, where we can work with a client the customer, and we say, let's as an additional step just to make sure, let's bring one of these out, park it into their location for three or four weeks, run some samples, run some tests and show our customer, our prospective customer that says that, the device can be well suited for the custom circumstances that surround that customer's water source. And I can't emphasize that enough. When you study the water business, there's language that's often used, and that is a standard components customized for the customer, right?Because in each situation, you just have to deal with a variety of variables that come against you, and it's the expertise of understanding that and the willingness to take the time and the patients to get it just right for the customer, that sets us apart in the marketplace, so three of those are ready for the field. I believe, we've just gotten a commitment are first one to go into the field, which we're very excited about. So we'll have more information on that as that becomes more solid. PFAS is estimated something like a $60 billion market a year. We tell stories like Orange County Water District had forecasted to solve their 60-some-odd wells that have detected a high level of PFAS, the total cost of $1.5 billion -- $1.5 billion the -- it's a big number.The other thing that we've learned is now entering into the marketplace, the projects are much bigger than we thought, which is good news, but they're significant. I mean, high-volume water, very large bodies of water, sometimes extraordinarily high levels of contamination. So there's a lot of technical challenges to go with that. And I guess the takeaway that I'd like to leave you with is, we're at the forefront with an innovation that has a competitive advantage that so far, we can't find a match. We think we stand out. It has a chance to be a number one solution. And the second is we have the talent to pull it off. And when we work with a customer, it's really that custom and that precision at which we define the target that separates us from the rest.And again, we're finding a welcome market for them. It's highly encouraging. Okay. The second, I want to talk about is the odor control. Remember, this started over a decade ago. And again, this is full circle -- full circle from its first innovation, early market adoption, the slugfest to get through the market, identify first corporate accounts at the national level for the waste handling industry. Over the last year or two, we've won a number of major supply chain agreements with municipal clients, and if there's a delivery system that's required, we pretty much built it. I mean, it's literally dozens and dozens of different configurations on how this technology can be deployed in the market, all featuring a technology that breaks down onerous compounds, no masking, no fragrance, safety stay, eco-friendly, it does no harm safer the people pay it and your pet and hence, the next business, which is, of course, proof.We're not going to show the video. If you haven't seen the video, please go to it, pooph.com, P-O-O-P-H, P-O-O-P-H.com. Please go watch the video. We're getting texts and e-mails and calls from all over the country now. That infomercial is showing up on national networks consistently all the time. And everybody goes, wow, right? Wow, it's really exciting. They are launching in Walmart as we speak. There's a lot of detail about that we don't have because of the nature of the beast. Walmart says you're in and you're in here, here and here and that's how it starts. And then the next thing, you know it's 20 stores and then 200, and that's happening as we speak. The advertising campaign put out by Ikigai, our partner indicates that it's available in Walmart.I think it's just available at Walmart to be clear. We're going to get more detail on that in the next week or so or two, right? We're going to be pinning that down a bit as our partner becomes more and more knowledgeable about the status of the rollout on the infrastructure, but we know that product has been shipped, it's across docks and now set fulfillment, which is really awesome. In addition, I want to point out that we've also been notified by our partner that two other major national organizations want to bring the product to market as well. And considering they're starting with Walmart and bringing on another, it really bodes well for the significance of a national footprint for this product, which is awesome. And of course, direct-to-consumer merchandising through infomercials is an incredibly powerful strategy.Remember in this deal, in this business deal, we supply the product, so we manufacture it, we make a margin off cost, cost plus margin. And we get a small royalty at 6% on sales and then we bargained to participate in the exit at 20%. That's a nice win-win situation. If you think about it, it allows us to also toll and track and cooperate in the fulfillment. We have significant tenure. 10 plus years of experience in making these products. How to make them? How not to make them? How to package them? How to deliver them? How to use them? And all the claims that go with it. And that's a powerful combination. When you combine it with someone like Ikigai guy, who are professional, professionals are developing compelling presentations that allow people to see value and feel the urge to buy it, because it needs such powerful needs in the marketplace.We have great storytellers in that regard. So the combination makes for a powerful partnership. The way I would say this preparation needs opportunity. This is 10 years of work plus. And when you finally get the right spot with the right people at the right time, you have a chance to truly disrupt the market. Some of the leaders in this category do well over a 1 billion. So when people say, how big is this category? Some of the big competition are in the 1 billion range, okay? So this is a big business. And proof is out to get it. And I think they're going to win a lot of market share. We're going to see these numbers continue to climb for quite some period of time. Noticed that is a new bottle. The new bottle put up is nice, and that's the bottle that you'll find at Walmart.If you have not purchased the product, go to Walmart, ask. Ask your local retailer about it. It's really helpful, right, if our shareholder base and our network takes up the call, but the challenge on the retail distribution marketplace to say, ""Hey, where can I get it. We like that a lot. So please buy it. Please consider it. It's a great product. We welcome feedback. Again, we've been using this product for 10 years. It works. It works. It works. It's chemically designed in such a way that it simply can't fail. And when we experience any trouble in the execution, it's usually a delivery system or a particularly unique challenge, but this chemistry is tried and true and safe, tried and true and safe, it works. Please go buy it. Okay. The next is the Garratt-Callahan.Garratt-Callahan has not launched yet. The way we think about it, and we expect it to be prior to now. So sometimes we wish it was faster, of course, there's nothing occurring in that process that will keep us from being successful. So we believe that it will generate imminent success. It's a great system. It's a great innovation on their side and our team is executed in a most excellent way. There are a number of customers at the table. And Garratt-Callahan is expanding and developing the national marketing campaign to support its national sales force. Remember, Garratt-Callahan is the largest privately held water company in North America, 100-plus years of history. Excellence in customer service is their game. That's what they do. It's a great fit for us.Remember, they came to us and said, if you'll make it, we'll sell it. Well, that's what we're doing. We expect it to be successful. It would surprise that we get our first customers here soon. In addition, we've also spec-ed in this system into a number of our projects that were being recruited by customers with. So between the two of us, we've got a number of situations where this asset is going to find its way to market. And again, we're going to say that it launches with the first sale -- and then from thereafter, we'll kind of break the mold and get on with it. Again, we love working with Garratt-Callahan. It's all in good order, anxious to get that first hit, not troubled about the delay, just anxious. Not troubled, just anxious -- not troubled just anxious.I didn't mention what it does, but the Garratt-Callahan's system, minimum liquid discharge has a key feature that allows us to reuse and recycle water used at cooling towers. Well, that's a big market. Cooling towers is heat exchangers that probably used in, I don't know, 30% or 40% of all manufacturing in the country in addition to places like data centers and all sorts of really interesting uses -- and wherever water is stressed or the PUC Public Utility Commission wants to reduce the amount of containments are being sent to the wastewater treatment plant. That system is your huckleberry . I mean it is built for speed. And so what it could do is take the water out of those systems, treat it, pull out the containment is put the water back in and generate as much as seven to 10 times the usefulness of the water which means also reduction of that amount of contamination put down the sewer right, to the PUC and allows for reuse.So it's a great system. It'll find its own Engineers. This started technologies four years ago, we made a bold decision to bring an entire team all at once with no customers. It was extraordinarily risky. It turned out to be one of the best decisions we've made as a company, and we've now partnered with and had the team joined BioLargo as a subsidiary. They are owner-operators, they're experts in their fields, literally 30 -- 20 to 30 years of experience across the team. And they worked at the highest level of industry and government. They are expert. And as a result of having such a significant talent to come alongside an innovator's pool, which is what we've been doing, we have now the capability of taking projects from start to finish all the way through, start to finish, scale up, sell in, support, engineer, scope, construct.I mean, you name it, we can do it. And so therein lies the challenge, right? Have a small company grow the way we're growing now and continue the growth curve because of the demands on the labor. It's a real issue. What you'll see in some of the projects we're involved in, we have the chance to be so significant financially, it's going to put pressure on us for manpower. There's just no question. Hence, the reason, right, the reason that we want to get to a business model that includes the replication of selling assets like equipment and service and replacement and all the things that create continuity and revenue stream and cash flow. And so it is a hybrid, there's no question, but that hybrid works because the people that sell in an are expert and committed to serving customers first, look out for them first.Get the customer exactly what they're supposed to get, hit the budget on target, on time. It works quite well. Our work with the United States Air Force has -- it's funny, it started out and it's kind of small, and it became bigger and bigger. It's just a really nice situation. And another -- the largest potato products manufacturer in North America is our customer. We picked up the international account represents 13 locations and doing work and on and on it goes. There's a portfolio of customers who buy services from us, and we're thankful for each of them. Two in particular represent what we would call opportunities of significance, right? -- things that can really move the needle. And we did complete Phase I, which is a feasibility study.Again, we want to point out the word feasibility because in this context, feasibility means the metrics that allow the developer right, the metrics to understand the cost of time and the execution cycle to go to a full-scale development in this case at 500 megawatts of energy, that project, if it goes to full scale, which is planned, it would be over $1.6 billion in capital investment. We completed phase one, which is to help the developer understand the components, the choices and where it goes next. Phase two, we expect to start early in 2023. And phase two could easily exceed $1 million, just so you get perspective. It's a lot of work, and that same developer has also come back to us and said they have six more projects that they'd like to engage us on.And we're in the process of scoping, essentially bidding, and we don't call it a bid, scoping and pricing, the budget to deliver phase one work on six more projects. So we're pretty excited about that, too. Again, a lot of work. I always say, we win the contract and then the word begins. So -- but again, very exciting. And if this goes to full scale, it really is a significant testimony to the expertise of the company and also means serious revenue. Right? Next is our work with Ultra Safe Nuclear. Again, phase one was complete. We talked about the choppiness, right? So from quarter two to quarter thee, we completed phase one. We go into a gap. We regroup for phase two, which is scoping and bidding on the pricing. And again, Ultra Safe just come back to us and said, we'd like to engage you for our work beginning in the first part of the year.And those numbers, again, will, we think, at least double or more. They're significant. And again, think about the unusual nature. We're being contracted as subcontracted design team to support a emerging technology company, focused on modular portable nuclear power plants, that would go underground. It's really awesome to be on the cutting edge in this way. And in this case, it's not our intellectual property. We're being paid to support them. Clyra Medical. Spend the second -- here we go, the advanced -- of course, the AOS. So we just reported -- a press release just a few weeks ago about our work at the now 18-month pilot at Montreal and a number of papers are in preparation for academic publication, plus the results are significant. And I think the key result to take away is, this is a very large-scale operation, the big unit, treating a lot of volume of water.We were able to demonstrate that its maintenance and service were in conformance with expectations of the industry that it performs. It doesn't degrade early. It actually does the job. It also really sets us up for a number of arguments to argue, defend a thesis to the marketplace that it has the ability to compete with UV as a disinfection machine that doesn't have to deal with the turbidity of UV and sometimes the finicky nature of dealing with UV lights. And so, it had extraordinarily low energy consumption. So, very low chemistry, very low energy and does a big job. So, again, it's working. Again, we're in a spot where we think that the Advanced Oxidation System will find its first home as part of treatment trains. And so, as our portfolio and our retina work expands, it's important to note that we don't bring in a rep network and channel partners to represent AEC', they represent the breadth of all of our offerings, which is our catalog, including our service capabilities, which is really quite a powerful combination.All the assets go out to the marketplace in that venue. And we think that, that is -- it's funny how it works. We just brought in also -- we mentioned this just a few months -- about a month ago, we brought in a supply chain partner, PRM out of North Carolina, great company, 40-year history, 250,000 square feet under roof. They build things like the AOS. So you get perspective. You kind of kind of get your head around it, who are these, right? They're selling products. And they're also a contract manufacturer. So they can make AOS, they can make AECs, they can make Minimum Liquid Discharge systems. And it gives us a team of people that are in the business with all of infrastructure in place in the 40-year history and also the technical know-how to see it in the marketplace, go into the market and support it.And so instantly, we formed an alliance there in which both entities are benefited by the things that we bring to the table. We bring innovations. We bring lots of property. We bring customers. They bring customers. They bring some of their own intellectual property and even they bring the ability to scale for manufacturing for us. So we think that's awesome. The Advanced Oxidation system in terms of its unique ability to manage micropollutants, that's pollutants that are highly-toxic, extraordinarily low-concentrations, things like estrogen and estradiol and ibuprofen, right, pharmaceuticals are stuck in water. That's a marketplace that's still evolving in North America. It's further advanced in Europe. There's, a lot of regulations that are continuing to tighten the news in Europe.See also 15 Most Hated Companies in the US and 12 Most Advanced Countries in Africa.And we believe it's only a matter of time before the AOS find its significant commercial home. That has not been accomplished, but the results of our extensive testing and validation work and now the inclusion into a portfolio of solutions with a national rent network, we think it's the perfect next step. Clyra Medical, Clyra Medical is coming along. We've been kind of quiet. I think that's important for a number of reasons. One is it represents a significant competitive threat to a lot of products. So -- we think that it's going to be a big home run. It's not there yet. It's going to require some capital. It's going to require some tender loving care. It's had its infancy in selling. It does have its first customers. It's gotten through the gate of regulatory first market adoption.And now, Clyra, very much like our other businesses, is building out a national rent network and also working with some major corporate accounts to get the technology and the product seeded into the marketplace. And it's done so with really a meter budget. And so we're anxious to see it grow up to the next-level. And of course, it's designed once it gets economic traction in the marketplace, which we predict it will. Then it's a great spin-off play for the company and for all our shareholders. Everyone can benefit. We also note that there's, three-channel partnerships in negotiation. They're quite large. And if we're able to get those executed, it has an almost immediate double, triple valuation kind of proposition. It's a big deal. So we're anxious to move those to the next phase.And we're working through it. And they are still underway, which is good. So what are we going to do to accelerate growth? Well, what we're doing. We're going to do it, right? We have a base of revenue projects where we highly focused on the key catalysts, those things we just covered. We have some new technologies that are always coming. And then really, the key for the growth strategy to develop scale is to lean into channel partnerships, lean heavily, right, so that we can tap into channel partners and their reach to the frontline of the marketplace, create economic opportunity for them to participate, to bring cutting-edge technology solutions to be in the market, solve problems other people having trouble solving. That's the business. And that's what we're doing on a daily basis.And now, as a result of PFAS and because of the success of sales improved, we're finding that our -- as they say, in a rising tide, all ships rise. That's what's happened at BioLargo. All ships are rising, and it represents a great time in the history of the company. And then to close, and we'll open up Q&amp;A. We make life better. It's a big vision, and it's focused on sustainable solutions for big commerce that impact the world, a lot of diverse people and talent pull-in together to make these solutions real for customers. And I think this is the dramatic evolution away from hardcore R&amp;D into commercialization is now. And I think the next few years are going to be full of right with dramatic growth. So I'm going to pause for a minute, and let's open this up for questions.Q&amp;A SessionA - Brian Loper: Excellent. Thank you very much, Dennis. Exciting time for BioLargo, really hope everyone got a chance to go through the press release and the Q that came out yesterday. I just wanted to highlight an 11% growth, pretty incredible growth here, as well as sustaining it quarter-by-quarter. So we're excited to be along for the ride. Some questions here from some investors here today. Can you talk a little bit more about Ikigai? So the 10-Q said that we're in negotiations to expand their rights under the license agreement, is that POOPH rights or something else?Dennis Calvert: It's a good question. We have an open door policy, of course, to partner with partners. So when we find a winner, we want to expand. And we've got a winner with Ikigai. So we really -- we love this company. I mean, they are they are intimate partners in our journey. And so they have a couple of ideas about markets where the technology, they believe, because of their unique marketing tools and they're now a national brand emerging that they can really make some hay. And so we're anxious to do that. And there is a negotiation about how we get that done, and I hope it comes to success, and we'll keep you posted. So absolutely.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:MMC) sold US$3.0m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-marsh-mclennan-companies-inc-120140289.html,1672142500,STORY,['MMC'],"[Over the past year, many Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Dean Klisura, sold US$1.5m worth of shares at a price of US$172 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$166. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

In total, insiders dumped US$2.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$197m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insiders?Insiders sold Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

You can skip our industry analysis and go directly to the 5 Undervalued Chip Stocks to Buy.The semiconductor market is essential to the advancement in technologies as the chips produced by the industry are used ubiquitously in a wide range of products, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and other electronic devices, as well as in a variety of industrial and military applications. The semiconductor market in recent years has been a rapidly growing and highly competitive industry, with a large number of players that range from large multinational corporations to smaller specialized firms. The market is driven by advances in technology. Some of the key trends in the semiconductor market include the increasing demand for smaller, more powerful devices, the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).Although the semiconductor industry has continued to grow over the past few years, with the total market value amounting to $527.88 billion in 2021, the semiconductor stocks have had a rough 2022, which is reflected in the performance of iShares Semiconductor ETF, down 35% YTD as of December 23, 2022. The rise in interest rates deteriorated the demand environment for chipmakers as discretionary spending on PCs and new devices slowed down, resulting in a period of inventory correction for semiconductor companies.Since the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature, a downturn caused by macroeconomic headwinds is not a surprise to many investors. Chip sales rose to $54.5 billion per month in March 2022 but have continued to decline since then as the macroeconomic outlook continued to deteriorate. There are also concerns regarding oversupply in the industry as many chipmakers did capacity expansions as demand boomed during the post-COVID period. During 2018 and 2020, wafer capacity increased by 25%; however, with demand slowing down, the chipmakers are currently dealing with clearing out the excess inventory and maintaining profitability.Story continuesAlthough the near-term market outlook may appear grim, the downturn in the market has provided an opportunity to own solid semiconductor companies at attractive valuations. The fundamental growth trends for the chip market still remain intact, with a rise in EV adoption and advancement in AI and IoT, and the market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 12.2% during the period 2022-2029 to $1,380.79 billion in 2029.Undervalued Chip Stocks To BuyIaroslav Neliubov/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo come up with a list of 10 undervalued chip stocks to buy, we have selected the top 10 chip stocks that are being recommended by other finance websites in order to understand the consensus opinion of other journalists over chip stocks.

Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia.It has previously warned it would not sell oil to countries working under the price cap.Last week, Alexander Novak, deputy prime minister, warned Russia may cut its oil output by 5pc-7pc in early 2023 in response.Exactly what impact the cap and the Russian response to it will have on global markets is as yet unclear, however.The US, the UK and the EU have already imposed bans on Russian oil and oil products, although the EU’s ban on diesel is not due to come into force until December 5.Countries such as China and India have so far been soaking up Russian supply.]"

But prices could hit $4 for a gallon of gas during the peak of travel season next summer, the company said in a forecast released Wednesday.After a turbulent year when gas prices hit a record-high national average of $5 a gallon, costs dropped to about $3.06 a gallon this week, tweeted Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, on Tuesday. The tech company's app provides real-time gas price information for more than 150,000 gas stations nationwide.How high will gas get in 2023?Twenty-six states now have gas prices below $3 a gallon, GasBuddy says.That could soon change. GasBuddy expects average gas prices in June to rise to $3.79 to $4.19 as the summer travel season kicks in, the company said. The average cost per gallon could go as high as $4.25 in August, then drop closer to $3 a gallon by year's end.Overall, the national average for 2023 is expected to be about $3.49 a gallon, down from the average of $3.96 in 2022, according to GasBuddy.Similarly, the Energy Information Administration forecast this month that U.S. retail gasoline prices will average about $3.50 a gallon in 2023.Why were gas prices so high in 2022?Gasoline and oil prices began to rise in 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Prices were driven up by U.S. and European Union sanctions hampering Russia's ability to sell crude oil. By December, gas prices had retreated below what it cost per gallon before Russia's invasion.“What we saw in 2022 was simply madness at the nation’s fuel pumps, with records being set seemingly left and right as COVID imbalances persisted and Russia invaded Ukraine,"" De Haan said in the forecast. ""While it’s highly improbable that lightning strikes the same spot twice, the storm clouds over oil and refined markets may persist, and there still could be some spikes as the market remains somewhat tight.""Story continuesWhen were gas prices most expensive?The current national average for regular unleaded gasoline, according to AAA, is $3.10, 2 cents lower than a week ago and 45 cents lower than one month ago. The highest-ever average price hit $5.016 on June 14, AAA said.Russia's assault on Ukraine, inflation and global economic concerns could bring continued volatility in the new year.""Curveballs are coming from every direction,"" De Haan said.

31,738ae3ca-2e0a-3643-8893-40e186eeaaab,O,2022-12-28,"Crude oil lower; China COVID cases, API inventories in focus",Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crude-oil-lower-china-covid-042851817.html,1672201731,STORY,"['UCO', 'SCO', 'CL=F']","[By Peter NurseInvesting.com -- Oil prices fell Wednesday on fears the surge in COVID cases in China after its reopening will hamper its economic recovery just as western economies head into recession, hitting fuel demand growth.By 04:30 ET (09:30 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $78.90 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $84.19 a barrel.China announced earlier this week that it will stop requiring inbound travelers to go into quarantine from early next year, news that helped crude prices reach their highest in three weeks on Tuesday.However, this policy, without a successful mass vaccination program, has resulted in a surge in COVID-19 infections, putting the country’s hospitals under severe pressure.While the opening of the Chinese economy is a clear winner for the oil market, given the country is the largest importer of crude in the world, any increase in demand may be delayed as the country struggles with the increase in infections.At the same time, many western economies are heading into recession, likely hitting demand for energy products, as central banks tighten monetary policy aggressively to combat soaring inflation.For example, the euro area faces a “very difficult economic situation” that will test individuals and businesses, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Tuesday.The supply equation remains unclear as well.The U.S. remains under a deep freeze, with oil refiners in the U.S. working to resume operations at a dozen facilities knocked offline by the winter storm across much of the country.Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that Moscow aims to ban oil sales from Feb. 1 to countries that abide by the G7 price cap, which started in early December.“How the Russia/Ukraine war evolves will be important for oil markets in 2023. While a de-escalation might not lead to the return of pre-war oil trade flows, it would remove a lot of supply risk from the market,” said analysts at ING, in a note.Story continuesBack in the U.S., the industry group American Petroleum Institute is due to release data on U.S. crude inventories later Wednesday, and stocks are expected to have fallen, adding to last week’s 3 million barrel draw.“The mentality of U.S. producers has changed significantly from producing as much as possible to focusing on shareholder returns and as a result, continuing to show discipline when it comes to capital spending,” ING added. “Supply chain issues, labour shortages and rising costs have also played a role in the more modest supply growth expected over the next year.”Related ArticlesCrude oil lower; China COVID cases, API inventories in focusJapan asks its insurers to retain marine war cover for LNG shippers in Russian watersCaught in the crossfire, Peru protest deaths keep anger burning]"

However, Chinese hospitals have been under intense pressure due to a surge in COVID infections.Oil markets were also buffeted by expectations of another interest rate hike in the United States, as the U.S. Federal Reserve tries to limit price rises in a tight labor market.Market participants noted that trading volumes this week are expected to be lighter than usual as the end of the year approaches, creating more volatility in oil prices.""My sense is the general risk-off mood has weighed on the oil prices, in a market with thin liquidity,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.Wednesday's declines also followed three straight sessions of higher settlements on both crude benchmarks. Prices were at their highest in three weeks on Tuesday, as a cold snap across the U.S. forced shutdowns at major production sites and refineries at the weekend.""We have seen a strong rebound over the last few weeks and that's being pared a little today but the narrative remains unchanged,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.""Next year brings immense uncertainty and plenty of potential upside risk for prices from the China reopening to lower Russian output and further OPEC+ cuts,"" Erlam said.Russia said it aims to ban oil sales from Feb. 1 to countries that abide by a G7 price cap imposed on Dec. 5, although details of how the ban would work were unclear.Story continuesU.S. crude oil inventories fell last week while gasoline and distillate stocks rose surprisingly, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Wednesday.The U.S. government will weekly inventory figures at 10:30 a.m. EST on Thursday.(Reporting by Shariq Khan, additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, Arathy Somasekhar, Isabel Kua; Editing by Louise Heavens and Barbara Lewis, Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio)]"

Less than a month after a CD story led to the implosion of crypto exchange giant FTX in November, Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris zeroed in on the seriousness of CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's offenses. The U.S. Department of Justice subsequently charged Bankman-Fried with wire fraud and other alleged crimes.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETFrozen Markets, a Bitcoin DriftBy James RubinBitcoin drifted lower in Tuesday trading, albeit not by much as investors continued their historical, year-end hibernation. Crypto prices remain frozen near the levels they've held for much of the past two weeks.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently changing hands at $16,700, off 1.3% over the past 24 hours but near its most recent support just under $17,000. BTC's price has remained resilient over the past two months, despite the widening fallout from the implosion of crypto exchange FTX.In a CoinDesk TV First Mover interview, Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist at Market Vector Indexes, noted bitcoin's strength relative to other cryptos. ""If you look at the coins that demonstrate relative strength, which means coins that fell the least amount from the all-time high, you will notice names that nearly no one would have imagined, especially when you consider the ranking,"" Leinweber said. ""So bitcoin was not the most defensive coin, one might expect from a store of value.""Story continuesEther was recently trading just over $1,200, also down 1.3% from Monday, same time. Most other major cryptos were slightly in the red with LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, and CRO, the native cryptocurrency of exchange Crypto.com, each sinking more than 2%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, fell 1.15%.Major equity indexes closed mixed after a good news, bad news day in which China announced it would allow international travelers to enter the country again but Russia said it would ban oil sales to countries that had placed a $60 per barrel price cap on it – the latest fallout from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. How the moves will affect prices worldwide is uncertain. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of global energy markets, was recently selling at $85 per barrel, an 11% gain over the past three weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 1.4%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up slightly.Meanwhile, FTX's sad, unsavory saga continued with documents filed in Caribbean court showing that former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from Alameda Research to purchase his stake in trading app Robinhood Markets (HOOD).In an affidavit before his arrest, Bankman-Fried said he and FTX co-founder Gary Wang together borrowed over $546 million from Alameda via promissory notes in April and May. They used that money to capitalize Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd., the shell corporation that in May bought a 7.6% stake of Robinhood.The FTX crisis has renewed calls for stronger regulation some seven months after the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its dollar peg. The consequent collapse of the Terra ecosystem during the spring jolted lawmakers who had been hesitating to create stricter guidelines targeting digital assets to ratchet up their efforts. As yet, little concrete has resulted, although many crypto insiders expect changes in the year ahead and beyond to protect investors.Market Vector Indexes' Leinweber said he would embrace stablecoin regulation. ""I welcome those regulations,"" he said. ""It will lead to more dollars in that space. There are some unregulated, poorer constructed ones. But they're also good stablecoins.""Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorTerraLUNA+4.1%Smart Contract PlatformXRPXRP+0.6%CurrencyCosmosATOM+0.3%Smart Contract PlatformBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorDogecoinDOGE−2.9%CurrencyGalaGALA−2.8%EntertainmentDecentralandMANA−2.4%EntertainmentInsightsFTX’s Collapse Was a Crime, Not an AccidentBy David Z. Morris, CoinDesk Chief Insights ColumnistIn the weeks since Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire was revealed to be a house of lies, mainstream news organizations and commentators have often failed to give their readers a straightforward assessment of exactly what happened. August institutions including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have uncovered many key facts about the scandal, but they have also repeatedly seemed to downplay the facts in ways that soft-pedaled Bankman-Fried’s intent and culpability.It is now clear that what happened at the FTX crypto exchange and the hedge fund Alameda Research involved a variety of conscious and intentional fraud intended to steal money from both users and investors. That’s why a recent New York Times interview was widely derided for seeming to frame FTX’s collapse as the result of mismanagement rather than malfeasance. A Wall Street Journal article bemoaned the loss of charitable donations from FTX, arguably propping up Bankman-Fried’s strategic philanthropic pose. Vox co-founder Matthew Yglesias, court chronicler of the neoliberal status quo, seemed to whitewash his own entanglements by crediting Bankman-Fried’s money with helping Democrats in the 2020 elections – sidestepping the likelihood that the money was effectively embezzled.Perhaps most perniciously, many outlets have described what happened to FTX as a “bank run” or a “run on deposits,” while Bankman-Fried has repeatedly insisted the company was simply overleveraged and disorganized. Both of these attempts to frame the fallout obfuscate the core issue: the misuse of customer funds.Banks can be hit by “bank runs” because they are explicitly in the business of lending customer funds out to generate returns. They can experience a short-term cash crunch if everyone withdraws at the same time, without there being any long-term problem.But FTX and other crypto exchanges are not banks. They do not (or should not) do bank-style lending, so even a very acute surge of withdrawals should not create a liquidity strain. FTX had specifically promised customers it would never lend out or otherwise use the crypto they entrusted to the exchange.CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris unpacks his latest opinion piece that argues Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of troubled crypto exchange FTX, is a fraud.See also: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried's Crypto Empire Blur on Alameda's Balance SheetIn reality, the funds were sent to the intimately linked trading firm Alameda Research, where they were, it seems, simply gambled away. This is, in the simplest terms, theft at a nearly unprecedented scale. While the total losses have yet to be quantified, up to one million customers could be impacted, according to a bankruptcy document.Read the full story hereImportant events.11 p.m. HKT/SGT(3 p.m. UTC): U.S. Pending Home Sales (Nov.

40,ba70ba2e-0a16-31f8-89d2-49cb32e8c3df,FE,2022-12-28,Bear Creek Mining Corporation's (CVE:BCM) biggest owners are individual investors who got richer after stock soared 17% last week,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-creek-mining-corporations-cve-120205884.html,1672228925,STORY,"['BCEKF', 'GC=F']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Bear Creek Mining Corporation (CVE:BCM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 48% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, individual investors were the biggest beneficiaries of last week’s 17% gain.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Bear Creek Mining, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Bear Creek Mining ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Bear Creek Mining?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Bear Creek Mining does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Bear Creek Mining, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthIt would appear that 11% of Bear Creek Mining shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. Equinox Gold Corp. is currently the largest shareholder, with 16% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 11% and 8.6% of the stock. Furthermore, CEO Anthony Hawkshaw is the owner of 0.7% of the company's shares.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Bear Creek MiningThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Bear Creek Mining Corporation. It has a market capitalization of just CA$136m, and insiders have CA$5.4m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but we usually like to see higher insider holdings. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 48% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Bear Creek Mining. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 25% of Bear Creek Mining. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Bear Creek Mining has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is significant)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia.It has previously warned it would not sell oil to countries working under the price cap.Last week, Alexander Novak, deputy prime minister, warned Russia may cut its oil output by 5pc-7pc in early 2023 in response.Exactly what impact the cap and the Russian response to it will have on global markets is as yet unclear, however.The US, the UK and the EU have already imposed bans on Russian oil and oil products, although the EU’s ban on diesel is not due to come into force until December 5.Countries such as China and India have so far been soaking up Russian supply.]"

And in the last two months, the profit consensus for the current year fell from 8-cents to zero.Worse, next year has seen EPS projections drop 41.7% from $0.72 to $0.42. And that's why EGO is in the cellar of the Zacks Rank.Expansion in GreecePart of the lowering of expectations revolves around new investment in Greece that was announced by the company on December 15.On Dec 20, Canaccord metals analyst Carey MacRury downgraded Eldorado Gold to Hold from Buy with a price target of C$12, up from C$10.50, after Eldorado announced a EUR 680 million project financing package to complete construction of the Skouries project in Greece and a board decision to proceed with the project.While MacRury views Skouries as potentially positive in the medium term and the financing terms as ""reasonable,"" he views the risk/reward for Eldorado as more balanced going forward with several years of negative free cash flow now potentially ahead.Cuban Clobbers Gold BugsMy thesis for years has been that gold is indeed the ""barbarous relic,"" especially in the age of permanent fiat systems and new digital currency innovations.My most recent summary of these views can be found in this Zacks Ultimate report...Why Gold Is Headed to Zero (email Ultimate@Zacks.com if you don't have access and tell 'em Cooker sent you)Another gold bear, billionaire Mark Cuban, just opined this week in much more ""colorful"" language.Cuban appeared on the Bill Maher podcast Club Random over the weekend and got into a discussion about Bitcoin.When the host said he’s ""very anti-Bitcoin"" and believed in the value of gold, the Dallas Mavericks owner replied ""I want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more.""He added, “If you have gold, you’re dumb as [a rock... or something like that].”Maher retorted that gold ""never goes away"" and that it's ""like a hedge against everything else.""Cuban's response comparing gold vs. crypto in terms of their inflation hedging and ""store of value"" attributes wasn't that articulate.But then he said something I found of value...""You don’t own the gold bar, and if everything went to hell in a hand basket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the [rock] out of you or kill you and take your gold bar.""According to Steve Mollman writing in Fortune online on December 24...Cuban has slammed gold investing before. In 2019, for instance, he said in a Kitco News interview, ""I hate gold. Gold is a religion.""When discussing the recent FTX implosion, Mollman observed the Shark Tank figure-head still believes in crypto’s potential, noting these apt comments from Cuban...""Separate the signal from the noise,"" he suggested. ""There’s been a lot of people making a lot of mistakes, but it doesn’t change the underlying value.""Bottom line: Neither Cuban or myself knows when the right time to buy Bitcoin will appear.

But prices could hit $4 for a gallon of gas during the peak of travel season next summer, the company said in a forecast released Wednesday.After a turbulent year when gas prices hit a record-high national average of $5 a gallon, costs dropped to about $3.06 a gallon this week, tweeted Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, on Tuesday. The tech company's app provides real-time gas price information for more than 150,000 gas stations nationwide.How high will gas get in 2023?Twenty-six states now have gas prices below $3 a gallon, GasBuddy says.That could soon change. GasBuddy expects average gas prices in June to rise to $3.79 to $4.19 as the summer travel season kicks in, the company said. The average cost per gallon could go as high as $4.25 in August, then drop closer to $3 a gallon by year's end.Overall, the national average for 2023 is expected to be about $3.49 a gallon, down from the average of $3.96 in 2022, according to GasBuddy.Similarly, the Energy Information Administration forecast this month that U.S. retail gasoline prices will average about $3.50 a gallon in 2023.Why were gas prices so high in 2022?Gasoline and oil prices began to rise in 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Prices were driven up by U.S. and European Union sanctions hampering Russia's ability to sell crude oil. By December, gas prices had retreated below what it cost per gallon before Russia's invasion.“What we saw in 2022 was simply madness at the nation’s fuel pumps, with records being set seemingly left and right as COVID imbalances persisted and Russia invaded Ukraine,"" De Haan said in the forecast. ""While it’s highly improbable that lightning strikes the same spot twice, the storm clouds over oil and refined markets may persist, and there still could be some spikes as the market remains somewhat tight.""Story continuesWhen were gas prices most expensive?The current national average for regular unleaded gasoline, according to AAA, is $3.10, 2 cents lower than a week ago and 45 cents lower than one month ago. The highest-ever average price hit $5.016 on June 14, AAA said.Russia's assault on Ukraine, inflation and global economic concerns could bring continued volatility in the new year.""Curveballs are coming from every direction,"" De Haan said.

While a de-escalation might not lead to the return of pre-war oil trade flows, it would remove a lot of supply risk from the market,” said analysts at ING, in a note.Story continuesBack in the U.S., the industry group American Petroleum Institute is due to release data on U.S. crude inventories later Wednesday, and stocks are expected to have fallen, adding to last week’s 3 million barrel draw.“The mentality of U.S. producers has changed significantly from producing as much as possible to focusing on shareholder returns and as a result, continuing to show discipline when it comes to capital spending,” ING added. “Supply chain issues, labour shortages and rising costs have also played a role in the more modest supply growth expected over the next year.”Related ArticlesCrude oil lower; China COVID cases, API inventories in focusJapan asks its insurers to retain marine war cover for LNG shippers in Russian watersCaught in the crossfire, Peru protest deaths keep anger burning]"

However, Chinese hospitals have been under intense pressure due to a surge in COVID infections.Oil markets were also buffeted by expectations of another interest rate hike in the United States, as the U.S. Federal Reserve tries to limit price rises in a tight labor market.Market participants noted that trading volumes this week are expected to be lighter than usual as the end of the year approaches, creating more volatility in oil prices.""My sense is the general risk-off mood has weighed on the oil prices, in a market with thin liquidity,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.Wednesday's declines also followed three straight sessions of higher settlements on both crude benchmarks. Prices were at their highest in three weeks on Tuesday, as a cold snap across the U.S. forced shutdowns at major production sites and refineries at the weekend.""We have seen a strong rebound over the last few weeks and that's being pared a little today but the narrative remains unchanged,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.""Next year brings immense uncertainty and plenty of potential upside risk for prices from the China reopening to lower Russian output and further OPEC+ cuts,"" Erlam said.Russia said it aims to ban oil sales from Feb. 1 to countries that abide by a G7 price cap imposed on Dec. 5, although details of how the ban would work were unclear.Story continuesU.S. crude oil inventories fell last week while gasoline and distillate stocks rose surprisingly, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Wednesday.The U.S. government will weekly inventory figures at 10:30 a.m. EST on Thursday.(Reporting by Shariq Khan, additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, Arathy Somasekhar, Isabel Kua; Editing by Louise Heavens and Barbara Lewis, Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio)]"

Less than a month after a CD story led to the implosion of crypto exchange giant FTX in November, Chief Insights Columnist David Z.

Crypto prices remain frozen near the levels they've held for much of the past two weeks.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently changing hands at $16,700, off 1.3% over the past 24 hours but near its most recent support just under $17,000. BTC's price has remained resilient over the past two months, despite the widening fallout from the implosion of crypto exchange FTX.In a CoinDesk TV First Mover interview, Martin Leinweber, digital asset product strategist at Market Vector Indexes, noted bitcoin's strength relative to other cryptos. ""If you look at the coins that demonstrate relative strength, which means coins that fell the least amount from the all-time high, you will notice names that nearly no one would have imagined, especially when you consider the ranking,"" Leinweber said. ""So bitcoin was not the most defensive coin, one might expect from a store of value.""Story continuesEther was recently trading just over $1,200, also down 1.3% from Monday, same time. Most other major cryptos were slightly in the red with LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, and CRO, the native cryptocurrency of exchange Crypto.com, each sinking more than 2%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, fell 1.15%.Major equity indexes closed mixed after a good news, bad news day in which China announced it would allow international travelers to enter the country again but Russia said it would ban oil sales to countries that had placed a $60 per barrel price cap on it – the latest fallout from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. How the moves will affect prices worldwide is uncertain. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of global energy markets, was recently selling at $85 per barrel, an 11% gain over the past three weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 1.4%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up slightly.Meanwhile, FTX's sad, unsavory saga continued with documents filed in Caribbean court showing that former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from Alameda Research to purchase his stake in trading app Robinhood Markets (HOOD).In an affidavit before his arrest, Bankman-Fried said he and FTX co-founder Gary Wang together borrowed over $546 million from Alameda via promissory notes in April and May. They used that money to capitalize Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd., the shell corporation that in May bought a 7.6% stake of Robinhood.The FTX crisis has renewed calls for stronger regulation some seven months after the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its dollar peg. The consequent collapse of the Terra ecosystem during the spring jolted lawmakers who had been hesitating to create stricter guidelines targeting digital assets to ratchet up their efforts. As yet, little concrete has resulted, although many crypto insiders expect changes in the year ahead and beyond to protect investors.Market Vector Indexes' Leinweber said he would embrace stablecoin regulation. ""I welcome those regulations,"" he said. ""It will lead to more dollars in that space. There are some unregulated, poorer constructed ones.

Morris, CoinDesk Chief Insights ColumnistIn the weeks since Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency empire was revealed to be a house of lies, mainstream news organizations and commentators have often failed to give their readers a straightforward assessment of exactly what happened. August institutions including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have uncovered many key facts about the scandal, but they have also repeatedly seemed to downplay the facts in ways that soft-pedaled Bankman-Fried’s intent and culpability.It is now clear that what happened at the FTX crypto exchange and the hedge fund Alameda Research involved a variety of conscious and intentional fraud intended to steal money from both users and investors. That’s why a recent New York Times interview was widely derided for seeming to frame FTX’s collapse as the result of mismanagement rather than malfeasance. A Wall Street Journal article bemoaned the loss of charitable donations from FTX, arguably propping up Bankman-Fried’s strategic philanthropic pose. Vox co-founder Matthew Yglesias, court chronicler of the neoliberal status quo, seemed to whitewash his own entanglements by crediting Bankman-Fried’s money with helping Democrats in the 2020 elections – sidestepping the likelihood that the money was effectively embezzled.Perhaps most perniciously, many outlets have described what happened to FTX as a “bank run” or a “run on deposits,” while Bankman-Fried has repeatedly insisted the company was simply overleveraged and disorganized. Both of these attempts to frame the fallout obfuscate the core issue: the misuse of customer funds.Banks can be hit by “bank runs” because they are explicitly in the business of lending customer funds out to generate returns. They can experience a short-term cash crunch if everyone withdraws at the same time, without there being any long-term problem.But FTX and other crypto exchanges are not banks. They do not (or should not) do bank-style lending, so even a very acute surge of withdrawals should not create a liquidity strain. FTX had specifically promised customers it would never lend out or otherwise use the crypto they entrusted to the exchange.CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist David Z. Morris unpacks his latest opinion piece that argues Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of troubled crypto exchange FTX, is a fraud.See also: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried's Crypto Empire Blur on Alameda's Balance SheetIn reality, the funds were sent to the intimately linked trading firm Alameda Research, where they were, it seems, simply gambled away. This is, in the simplest terms, theft at a nearly unprecedented scale. While the total losses have yet to be quantified, up to one million customers could be impacted, according to a bankruptcy document.Read the full story hereImportant events.11 p.m. HKT/SGT(3 p.m. UTC): U.S. Pending Home Sales (Nov.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Most Overvalued Companies According to the Media.The significant correction in the global equities markets over the past 11 months of 2022 has significantly reduced the number of overvalued stocks in the market. The correction has been due to uncertain economic circumstances stemming from rising inflation globally due to high commodity prices and geopolitical instability. This has caused the US Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world to increase the benchmark interest rates, which has dampened the growth outlook and heightened the probability of a recession.The renowned S&amp;P 500 Index is down over 17% since the start of the year and entered the bear market on numerous occasions this year. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index has lost over 29% of its value year-to-date (YTD) and has been in the bear market territory since August 2022. Publicly listed companies belonging to the cryptocurrency universe, the marijuana industry, and those that benefitted from the stay-at-home trends during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 have also seen a significant correction as they have lost as much as 80% to 90% of their underlying values.However, there are still numerous companies belonging to the healthcare, energy, industrials, media, and tech sectors that are still trading at a premium to their fair value. Recently we brought the most shorted stocks to your attention in an article. Most shorted stocks are the most overvalued companies, according to hedge funds and institutional investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at the overvalued stocks according to financial journalists. Multiple media reports have termed companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) as overvalued on the basis of certain valuation metrics.Story continues10 Most Overvalued Companies According to the MediaImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe have referred to numerous leading financial websites such as Forbes, Nasdaq, Investor Place, and Seeking Alpha to shortlist the 10 most overvalued companies. We used a total of 7 articles to report the consensus picks of financial journalists. These websites have termed these companies as overvalued on the basis of fundamentals like forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), and the price-to-earnings-growth ratio. We have ranked these stocks according to the number of articles that flagged them as overvalued.10 Most Overvalued Companies According to the Media10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Flagged Overvalued by Number of Articles: 2International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an Armonk, New York-based diversified technology and services solutions provider of consulting and cloud computing services, IT infrastructure, and software-as-a-service (SaaS).Although International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock offers an attractive one-year forward dividend yield of 4.49% and is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat list, the stock is trading at a forward adjusted P/E ratio of 16.26x as of December 26. This reflects a premium of over 39.3% as compared to the five-year forward P/E multiple of 11.67x. Furthermore, the adjusted PEG ratio of 1.96x is 28.3% higher than the sector median PEG ratio of 1.53x. Analysts think the overall valuation of the company looks expensive. The forward EV/EBIT for International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands at 17.81x, which shows a premium of 30.36% from the five-year average of 13.66x and a premium of 10.42% against the sector median of 16.13x.Here’s what St. James Investment Company said about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (Click here to see the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Flagged Overvalued by Number of Articles: 2Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is a Deerfield, Illinois-based diversified industrials company that has the distinction of being the biggest producer of construction equipment globally. Furthermore, the company has a leading position in the manufacturing of mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stock is widely regarded as an industrial bell weather.The overvaluation of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) can be gauged by the fact that the stock is currently trading at a forward EV/Sales multiple of 2.52x, reflecting a premium of 54.4% from the sector median of 1.63x. Furthermore, this also represents a premium of 5.30% against the five-year forward EV/Sales multiple for the company. Meanwhile, the forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple stands at 2.02x, which is 59.4% and 11.7% higher than the sector median of 1.27x and the company’s five-year average of 1.81x, respectively. Despite the broad market downturn, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stock has observed an increase of around 10% since the start of the year due to its defensive capabilities. However, experts now believe there is a high possibility of valuation compression as benchmark interest rates are rising.Diamond Hill Capital shared its outlook on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”As of Q3 2022, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) was held by 43 hedge funds.8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Flagged Overvalued by Number of Articles: 2Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a San Francisco, California-based provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) services. The company has the distinction of having 150,000 companies as its customers as of 2022.The stock is currently trading at a forward P/S ratio of 4.19x, which reflects a premium of 63.7% from the sector median of 2.56x. Rob Oliver at Baird downgraded Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stock from an Outperform to a Hold rating and reduced the target price from $200 to $150. The analyst highlighted that the macroeconomic circumstances have remained challenging for Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and the departure of the company’s key executives recently has raised a red flag for the organization. The analyst considers the departure of notable executives as a surprise. All these developments are expected to pressure the top-line growth prospects of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in the short term, which would adversely impact the P/S ratio in the future.Here’s what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”7. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Flagged Overvalued by Number of Articles: 2The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is an Arlington, Virginia-based designer, manufacturer, and seller of aerospace and defense equipment and services.The producer of the famous Boeing 747 aircraft is currently trading at a forward EV/Sales multiple of 2.27x, which translates into a premium of over 38.9% from the sector median of 1.63x and a premium of 8.07% against the company’s five-year average EV/Sales ratio of 2.10x. The possibility of an economic slowdown increases the likelihood of order cancellations as global business and vacation traveling have taken a serious hit during previous recessions. Furthermore, defense spending could also take a serious hit as governments would be forced to reduce spending to lower fiscal deficits. Experts think The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is heavily dependent on capital spending and is a cyclical stock in nature. The company lost 70% of its value during the Financial Crisis of 2007 and 65% of its value when the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s.Here’s what Meridian Funds said about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”As of Q3 2022, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was held by 42 hedge funds.6. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Flagged Overvalued by Number of Articles: 3 Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a San Ramon, California-based diversified, integrated oil company that is involved in the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments of the energy value chain.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock is currently trading at an adjusted forward P/E ratio of 8.76x, reflecting a premium of over 15.2% compared to the sector median adjusted forward P/E multiple of 7.60x. The premium valuation assumes the company needs to grow by high double-digits in the long term. This appears a daunting challenge as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has not experienced such an aggressive growth trajectory in the past.Furthermore, in case of a recession, crude oil prices could decline significantly, which would not also play in favor of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The stock has already experienced a meteoric rise of 43.1% since the start of 2022. The premium valuation of the stock was highlighted as the reason for downgrading the stock from a Buy to a Hold rating by Kim Fustier at HSBC. The analyst assigned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock a target price of $177 and added that there is a visible valuation gap between the US-based oil majors and their European counterparts.Here’s what Diamond Hill Capital said about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”In addition to Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) are also among the most overvalued companies according to the media.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Overvalued Companies According to the Media.   Suggested articles:20 Largest Hotel Chains in the World12 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics10 Jim Cramer Stock Picks This WeekDisclosure: None. 10 Most Overvalued Companies According to the Media is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(CRM) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-salesforce-inc-crm-140002015.html,1672149602,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -15.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has lost 3.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.93 points to a change of +3.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.65 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $7.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9%. The $30.93 billion and $34.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.7% and +10.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.2%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.27 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.39%. The EPS surprise was +15.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Sealed Air Sealed Air's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Sealed Air's EPS has grown 18% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Sealed Air remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 7.9% to US$5.8b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Sealed Air's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Sealed Air Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.Shareholders in Sealed Air will be more than happy to see insiders committing themselves to the company, spending US$578k on shares in just twelve months. When you contrast that with the complete lack of sales, it's easy for shareholders to be brimming with joyful expectancy. It is also worth noting that it was CEO, President &amp; Director Edward Doheny who made the biggest single purchase, worth US$256k, paying US$56.95 per share.Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Sealed Air is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. With a whopping US$52m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Does Sealed Air Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Sealed Air has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Furthermore, company insiders have been adding to their significant stake in the company. So it's fair to say that this stock may well deserve a spot on your watchlist. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Sealed Air has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Keen growth investors love to see insider buying.

MSI recently announced that the Federal Court in Australia has upheld its copyright and patent rights that were reportedly infringed by Hytera Communications Corporation Limited. With this, the company has secured a favorable ruling from three different countries, including the United States and Germany, with the jury unanimously confirming that Hytera has blatantly violated its patents and trade secrets.Hytera is a leading global provider of innovative Professional Mobile Radio communications solutions in China. Motorola had accused Hytera of illicitly importing and selling two-way radio equipment and systems and related software and components that infringed four of its patents. These patents relate to technologies core to the operation of Hytera’s professional and commercial radio products available today.The federal court in Australia observed that Hytera’s Digital Mobile Radio products that infringe Motorola’s patent include 22 models of its portables, two models of mobiles and four models of its repeaters. Hytera was also found to have unlawfully copied Motorola’s source code in its Digital Mobile Radio equipment, thereby infringing its copyright.The ruling has issued an injunction against Hytera for making, importing or selling any product in Australia that infringe Motorola’s patent and copyrights.  The favorable decision underscored the strength of Motorola’s IP rights and its relentless pursuit to protect its patents from any infringements and copyright violations.As one of the top providers of mission-critical communication products and services, Motorola has ensured a steady revenue stream from this niche market. This communications equipment maker intends to augment its position in the public safety domain by entering into alliances with other players in the ecosystem. It is poised to benefit from organic growth and acquisition initiatives, disciplined capital deployment and a favorable global macroeconomic environment.Motorola expects to witness strong demand across land mobile radio products, services and software.

But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Signet Jewelers Limited (NYSE:SIG) share price has soared 214% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! On top of that, the share price is up 22% in about a quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Signet Jewelers moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Signet Jewelers has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Signet Jewelers' financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Signet Jewelers, it has a TSR of 224% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Signet Jewelers returned a loss of 19% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 23%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 7%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Signet Jewelers better, we need to consider many other factors.

SUZ, Tencent Music Entertainment Group TME, Banco do Brasil S.A. BDORY and Core &amp; Main, Inc. CNM.5 Discounted PEG Stocks Ideal for GARP Investors In the equity market, investments need to be prudently hedged to overcome uncertainties and limit losses related to external shocks. A question that arises often is whether one should resort to a value strategy that seeks discounted stocks or opt for growth investing in times of extreme market instability.The investing track of the Oracle of Omaha over the past few decades and his gradual shift from being a pure-play value investor to a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investor might give us all the answers.Per the GARP theory, the strategic mingling of growth and value-investing principles gives us a hybrid strategy, offering an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both. What GARPers look for is whether or not the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).Several stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, show an overwhelming success of this hybrid investing strategy over pure-play value and growth investments. Here we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These include Signet Jewelers, Suzano S.A., Tencent Music Entertainment Group, Banco do Brasil S.A. and Core &amp; Main, Inc..A Few More Words on GARPGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics — the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks' P/E ratio with the future earnings growth rates.While P/E alone gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps identify stocks with solid future potential.Story continuesA lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio indicating both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the five stocks that qualified the screening:Signet Jewelers: Headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda, Signet Jewelers is a retailer of diamond jewelry, watches as well as other products. The company operates in the United States, Canada, the U.K., the Republic of Ireland, and the Channel Islands. The company is often considered the leading retailer of diamond jewelry.Signet Jewelers can also be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of B.

The company produces and sells eucalyptus pulp and paper products in Brazil and internationally. It operates through Pulp and Paper segments.

Walgreens chief clinical trials officer Ramita Tandon spoke with our very own Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani earlier this month on Walgreens' new avenue into the healthcare space with the launch of its clinical trial business this past summer. Let's take a listen.RAMITA TANDON: Yeah, at Walgreens, we're on this exciting journey as we move into healthcare and create this healthcare continuum and deliver healthcare services at a local level. And we launched our clinical trials business in June of this year, a tech enabled business, and really part of this complete healthcare continuum. And clinical trials is something that over the past few decades, very nuanced in the research enterprise ecosystem. But less than 5% of the US population participates in clinical trials. And 75% that do participate are Caucasian.So we believe that there's a tremendous opportunity leveraging the Walgreens scale, the footprint, and the trust that it has established in the local communities as an opportunity to really disrupt how we deliver clinical trials into our local communities. So our goal as we've launched this business is really trying to bring trials into communities that have never had access before and really part of the broader mission from Walgreens, again, as we move closer into healthcare and deliver healthcare into our local communities.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Right, and for those who don't know normally, it's through a provider or an established clinical site, a facility that tends to host these clinical trials, funded largely by the government or a sponsor. So that's really interesting as well because it sort of shifts the dynamic of your relationship with these drug companies. Do you have some insight on what kinds of clinical trials you would be sort of limited to, just based on the availability of facilities and resources?Story continuesRAMITA TANDON: Yeah, it's a great question. So the typical approach is, as you mentioned, is that most providers are asked to support manufacturers in the clinical trial ecosystem. And it's to find patients for trials. And oftentimes, we know providers and other practitioners, whether they're part of AMCs or they're individual practices, can be extremely busy. And to put a clinical trial on top of busy practitioners can be quite burdensome to some extent.And so our goal is twofront. Number one, you know, Walgreens serves roughly 120 million, 130 million lives that visit our stores and pharmacies on a regular basis. So we want to make sure that as we bring trials into communities, we are finding the right patients for trials, particularly in communities that have never had access to clinical research before.So number one is to help manufacturers find patients a lot faster, and we're using technology to enable that workflow. And it allows us to be more precise in finding patients that have the right disease conditions, the demographics, and the overall background and match those patients to trials.And when we find those patients, our goal is to make patients feel comfortable to participate. Now we know today, there are tremendous amount of barriers for patients to participate, whether they're travel barriers, language barriers, even medical or digital literacy. And so our goal is how do we make patients feel comfortable, but more importantly, make trials more accessible and convenient for patients to participate?So what we have done is leveraging our physical footprint and converting our stores and pharmacies as clinical trial centers. Now, we recognize if we give the opportunity for a patient to come into their local pharmacy, have an opportunity to talk to our pharmacist, to learn more about clinical trials and to be educated and feel more comfortable and perhaps start to remove some of those barriers or preconceived notions about clinical trials, it's one step further to make it more convenient and improve the experience level for a patient to participate.So we're using our physical footprint as an opportunity for patients to come in and get clinical trial visits completed. Now some of the services that we're able to provide are the low complex services, so screening, diagnostic, and some blood draws. And we recognize that in the ecosystem, we're not here to displace the provider and that patient relationship. In fact, that is a very vital, that relationship that exists.But we at Walgreens want to help enable and support that ecosystem so patients don't drop out. And in fact, they can come into their local Walgreens, get a normal follow-up visit completed, and keep that patient in the trial and start to improve the overall retention rates on a clinical trial.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: So that's a really good differentiator to point out. It's not necessarily that you'll be full-on conducting these trials or being part of that protocol, but in the immediate follow-up after delivery. Because I know some of these things can be pretty complex, like infusions. I can't imagine that Walgreens is yet at that stage to be able to support that. But is that a long-term goal? Is it-- because you are doing some buildout. Do you envision as the company gets deeper into healthcare, that this is going to be an area where you can even build out to have more robust tools, medical tools, and the like, to be able to use for clinical trials?RAMITA TANDON: Yeah, as we, at Walgreens, continues to build out our healthcare continuum service footprint and start to understand what our communities need, certainly, it's something for us to continue to think about. But today, as we partner with a number of healthcare systems across the ecosystem and across the nation, our goal is to become a support mechanism for healthcare systems or other providers so that ultimately, patients feel comfortable to participate and as well as carry forward with the trial obligations.But certainly something for us to think about as we carry forward and we start to listen and learn and understand how the patients are feeling as they start to move through this process. And as we start to get more data, certainly we'll start to expand that footprint and the types of services that we can deliver under clinical trial ecosystem.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Talk to me about the support for this, resources and the like. Does this come directly from the trial sponsors? Or are you partnering with the providers themselves? Where is that dynamic in play?RAMITA TANDON: Yeah, good question. We have made some significant investments, both from a real world evidence perspective, where, obviously, we have tremendous amount of information on the patient's pharmacy records. Through a partnership, we have access to clinical records, both structured, unstructured data. So we certainly have in-house staff that can help to analyze the information and start to help us understand the right patients for trials.And as we think about the trial conduct, we have created a centralized operations team that consists of project managers, clinical study coordinators, people that are well versed in the clinical trial conduct, and to be able to support, whether we support on-site-- so if a patient comes in to our local pharmacies, we'll have staff available onsite-- but also if a trial warrants more of a virtual or a hybrid model, we have the opportunity to digitize and use telehealth. And certainly, our staff can support from that mechanism.And then finally, from a home healthcare, we certainly have some trials that warrant aspects of the clinical trial visit to be done at patients' homes. And certainly, with our acquisition with CareCentrix, it allows us to mobilize efforts and deliver trial activities out of patients' homes. So we have certainly brought on a number of talent from the industry that understand the clinical trial space and can support the conduct. And certainly, as we look to partner with providers, as we leverage physicians to help support the oversight of these clinical trials, we certainly do have a number of partners as we bring on board physicians to help support in this workflow.]"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Barrett Business Services has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Paychex has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that BBSI's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.BBSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.41, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 27.35. We also note that BBSI has a PEG ratio of 1.03. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.65.Another notable valuation metric for BBSI is its P/B ratio of 3.83. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 13.05.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to BBSI's Value grade of B and PAYX's Value grade of C.BBSI sticks out from PAYX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that BBSI is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SYY, AbbVie ABBV, and PepsiCo Inc. PEP – could all be considerations for investors looking to reap a reliable income stream.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.Sysco Corp. Sysco markets and distributes a range of food and related products primarily to the food service or food-away-from-home industry.Sysco’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.5%, modestly below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average. Still, the company’s 8.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, it’s hard to ignore SYY’s growth profile; earnings are forecasted to soar 28% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 13% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 11.5% in FY23 and 4.2% in FY24.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAbbVieAbbVie enjoys leadership positions in key therapeutic areas, including immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics, eye care, and women’s health.AbbVie’s 3.5% annual dividend yield is well above its Zacks Medical Sector average of 1.4%. Further, ABBV carries a sustainable 41% payout ratio paired with an impressive 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also generates solid cash; ABBV generated roughly $7.4 billion in free cash flow in its latest quarter, representing a 52% sequential uptick.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCo Inc. PepsiCo is a long-established company engaged in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. Currently, the company sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).PEP’s annual dividend currently yields 2.5%, a few ticks below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average of 2.7%. Like SYY, PepsiCo’s 6.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCo has been on an impressive earnings streak as of late, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in each of its last three quarters. Just in its latest release, the company registered a 6.5% EPS beat and reported revenue 5.3% above expectations.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineDividends cushion the blow of losses in other positions, provide an additional way to earn a return on investment, and allow for maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.Dividend Aristocrats are common targets of income-focused investors, as these companies have successfully upped their dividend payouts for a minimum of 25 consecutive years.However, the Elite Dividend Kings group sits right above, which consists of companies increasing their payouts uninterrupted for a minimum of 50 consecutive years.Clearly, Dividend Kings, including Sysco Corp.

72,f50738fc-1ec0-31b0-9233-e13231075d0b,ADM,2022-12-28,5 Top-Ranked Dividend Growth Stocks for 2023,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-ranked-dividend-growth-120712788.html,1672142832,STORY,['ADM'],"[As volatility and uncertainty triggered by Fed’s policy tightening and recessionary fears persist in the stock market ahead of the New Year, dividend investing seems to be a better bet. Though it does not offer dramatic price appreciation, the strategy is a major source of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk.Honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM, Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, Insperity Inc. NSP, Deere &amp; Company DE and H&amp;R Block Inc. HRB — that could be compelling picks for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 13.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

She drove 33 hours straight from Nashville to Los Angeles after her Southwest flight was canceled. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)As chaos at Southwest Airlines brought misery to thousands of frustrated travelers and growing scrutiny from U.S. regulators and lawmakers, many in the aviation industry said the massive cancellation of flights by the nation's largest domestic carrier was far from surprising.Industry experts and union leaders for Southwest employees cited the company’s outdated technology and vulnerable operations, both of which are particularly susceptible to any disruptions, much less multiple coast-to-coast weather events.“This was the perfect storm,” William McGee, a senior fellow focused on aviation for the American Economic Liberties Project. “Other [airlines] dealt with this and came back from this; Southwest was sort of brought to its knees. It deserves to be blamed for not being more resilient.”Greyson Salazar, 9, arriving from Dallas, searches for his luggage among the sea of bags at baggage claim at LAX Southwest Terminal 1 on Wednesday. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)Of the more than 3,000 flights canceled Tuesday across the U.S., about 85% were Southwest's, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Thousands of the airline's passengers were stranded in airports across the nation — not to mention its crew members. In California, hundreds of flights have been delayed or canceled through the end of the week — making up much of the Southwest schedule.The U.S. Department of Transportation said this week it plans an inquiry into the source of the airline's massive problems.Although the company acknowledged delays and cancellations and blamed most of the headaches on bad weather, leaders have offered little explanation or plans for relief.“Our heartfelt apologies for this are just beginning,"" the airline said in a statement. ""We recognize falling short and sincerely apologize.”Michael Santoro, vice president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Assn., said Southwest has failed to invest in an updated software system used for flight routing and staffing, which is crucial to avoid continual problems.Passengers hunt for their luggage at LAX Southwest Terminal 1 on Wednesday. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)“The catalyst was the big storm,” Santoro said in an interview. “But our internal software can’t handle massive cancellations. The company hasn’t invested the money into scheduling infrastructure to support the network they have developed.Story continues“So pilots are calling in asking, I’m done with this flight — where do I go next? Am I running another plane? Do I spend the night here? And pilots are on hold for hours trying to figure out what to do next.”The cancellations are expected to continue. Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the airline planned to operate at around one-third of regular capacity as it tries to regroup and get the schedule back on track.“This is not hyperbole, I’ve never seen an airline meltdown of this size and magnitude,” said McGee, who has worked in and around U.S. airlines for almost four decades.Although McGee and union leaders pointed directly to technology shortcomings for the unprecedented delays this week, experts said they could also be due in part to the way Southwest does business. The U.S. airline giant has no partnerships with other airlines to assist with rebookings, it operates with few open seats or backup crews and its unique flight patterns — running from destination to destination instead of in and out of certain hubs — leave little room for error, meaning delays can quickly spiral.“They just keep domino-ing and cascading,” McGee said. “It will take weeks to try to just accommodate all the people who have been displaced.”Southwest's flight patterns mean that “if one flight is canceled or delayed, it’s going to make a mess for everyone the whole day,” said Brian Sumers, editor of the Airline Observer newsletter. “It’s a complicated airline.”Santoro said Southwest’s point-to-point network is “super-complex” but works well when there are no unforeseen storms. “It’s a great network,” he said. “It just needs to be supported correctly, and it hasn’t been.”Michael Massoni, first vice president of Transport Workers Union Local 556, said the flight attendants union has complained about Southwest’s “antiquated technology” for a decade.“When you have a weather event, airplanes get stuck and crews get stuck,"" Massoni said. ""But the software literally can’t keep up with where the airplanes are and where the flight attendants are.”What ensues, he said, is ""chaos,"" and Southwest's only option is to deal with the problem manually.Union officials agree with the company that the flight interruptions are not due to staffing issues, saying there were enough pilots and crews scheduled for the holidays.With existing software, “the network spirals out of control,"" Capt. Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Assn., said in a statement to members. ""The company’s failed solution? Hire more. ... We aren’t undermanned. … Even with the correct number of pilots on any given day, the house of cards fails, and fail it does with ever-increasing frequency and severity.”Many industry analysts said there’s still much to investigate about this breakdown.“We just don’t know what’s really happened there to cause such an unprecedented cancellation pattern,” said Kathleen Bangs, spokesperson for FlightAware. “What was the system failure?""The record for most U.S. flight cancellations in 2022 was set Feb. 3 — when a storm in the South and Midwest briefly closed Dallas Fort Worth International Airport — but that was surpassed Dec. 23, Bangs said.In February, many flights were preemptively canceled to deal with the weather, but Southwest didn't take that step this past week, she said.“With it being the holidays, it’s really tough to preemptively cancel flights,” Bangs said. “It just really backfired.”The chaos at Southwest prompted criticism from federal lawmakers as well.Sens. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), members of the Senate Commerce Committee, said Southwest should not be able to claim flight cancellations were caused by recent winter storms, which would allow the airline to avoid reimbursing travelers.Compensation should include not only rebooked flights, refunds, hotels, meals and transportation but also “significant monetary compensation for the disruption to their holiday plans,” the two senators said in a statement.Southwest’s meltdown reached the Oval Office, with President Biden posting on Twitter that airlines would be held responsible and directing aggrieved travelers to the Department of Transportation website to determine whether they’re entitled to compensation.“Our administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted Tuesday.Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, said Tuesday that the committee will examine the causes of the disruptions and their effects on consumers.“The problems at Southwest Airlines over the last several days go beyond weather,” Cantwell said in a statement. “Many airlines fail to adequately communicate with consumers during flight cancellations. Consumers deserve strong protections, including an updated consumer refund rule.”Furious and weary travelers flooded Southwest on Twitter with reports of long lines that extended outside airport terminals, missing luggage that in some cases traveled onward despite canceled flights or piled up unclaimed for days. Southwest passengers were also forced to wait hours to reach consumer support representatives on the phone or were repeatedly getting disconnected, and struggled to navigate a glitchy website.Passengers are blaming Southwest workers for the delays, Santoro said, which has become embarrassing.""We apologize and apologize,"" Santoro said. ""But it's not our fault. We're ready to work. We're showing up. But we just need Southwest to put us on an airplane — tell us which airplane to fly.”Times staff writers Alexandra E. Petri, Sarah Wire and Courtney Subramanian contributed to this report.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

You can skip our overview and go directly to the 5 Best Stocks In Each Sector.When it comes to investing in the stock market, having a diversified portfolio certainly does wonders for long-term investors. There is an old adage, ""Don't put all of your eggs in one basket,"" and it is often quoted by legendary investors like Warren Buffett, underscoring the importance of having a diversified portfolio.What is diversification, you may ask? Diversification involves mitigating risk by investing in a variety of relatively less correlated assets/industries. Diversification can greatly help to reduce risk and improve the potential for long-term returns. When it comes to investment in the stock market, diversification can be achieved by investing in a range of stocks from different sectors, industries, and geographic regions.There are several benefits to diversification in stock investing:Risk reduction: By spreading investments across a variety of stocks, the risk of loss is reduced as the performance of one stock is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall portfolio. This is because the returns of different stocks tend to be uncorrelated, meaning they are not influenced by the same factors.Improved returns: While diversification may reduce the risk of loss, it can also potentially lead to improved returns over the long term. This is because a diversified portfolio is more likely to capture the overall performance of the market rather than being reliant on the performance of a single stock or sector.Flexibility: Diversification allows investors to adjust their portfolios to changing market conditions by adding or removing stocks as needed. This flexibility can help investors to capitalize on opportunities and minimize potential losses.Warren Buffett famously made a bet on the S&amp;P500 that the market index would beat the returns generated through active investing by hedge fund managers. To no surprise, Warren Buffett came out as a winner as no hedge fund was able to beat the market from the period of January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017.Story continuesAlthough 2022 was not a good year for the stock market in general, there were certain sectors that generated high returns for investors. Energy stocks, for example, soared as oil and gas prices skyrocketed after the war in Ukraine and the increased global demand. In 2022, The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index returned a whopping 63% to investors, including dividends. Value stocks provided solid returns to investors as growth stocks came under pressure from the rising interest rates. The S&amp;P 500 Value Index, although is down 5.1% YTD on a total return basis, it outperformed the broader S&amp;P 500 index substantially, which is down ∼20% YTD.Our MethodologyTo come up with 11 best stocks in each sector, we have picked the most popular stock amongst hedge funds from each industry outlined by the MSCI.

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.HCA Healthcare hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn around. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on HCA Healthcare will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Some Growth For HCA Healthcare?The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/E like HCA Healthcare's is when the company's growth is tracking the market closely.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 9.0%. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 86% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 8.5% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.3% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that HCA Healthcare's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders are comfortable to simply hold on while the company is keeping a low profile.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On HCA Healthcare's P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.As we suspected, our examination of HCA Healthcare's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook is contributing to its current P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future under these circumstances.You need to take note of risks, for example - HCA Healthcare has 3 warning signs   (and 1 which is concerning) we think you should know about.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than HCA Healthcare.

86,97864cb8-0f55-3437-9ffe-c701e5f1b3f7,HCA,2022-12-28,15 Largest Healthcare Companies by Market Cap,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-healthcare-companies-market-144221381.html,1672152141,STORY,"['ISRG', 'HCA', 'CNC', 'BSX', 'SYK', 'MDT', 'BDX']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 largest healthcare companies by market cap. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 largest healthcare companies by market cap.Competition should always be encouraged in the business world. After all, competition breeds innovation and innovation results in better advancements that improve the quality of our lives. The improvement in standard of living in just the past few decades is incredible and versus the previous century, it is almost unthinkable how far humanity has progressed.However, it is a debatable topic that some industries should be regulated more by the governments and shouldn't be for profit. One of these industries is the healthcare industry, where literally the lives of people are on the line. In most of the developed countries in the world, healthcare is regulated by the government, with socialized healthcare available to its citizens and residents. In fact, the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where the healthcare industry is for-profit, which is why 11 of the 15 largest healthcare companies by market cap are located in the U.S.15 largest healthcare companies by market capPhoto by CDC on UnsplashOn one hand, allowing the healthcare industry to remain for-profit allows for greater competition and innovation, as companies are highly motivated to invest in and develop new solutions to problems. Many of the advancements made in the healthcare industry come from the U.S. which is also the most technologically advanced country in the world precisely because of the high level of competition and freedom allowed to companies operating within the country, as compared to Western Europe, where focus is higher on consumer rights and companies have to comply with strict regulations that can stifle innovation, and be detrimental to consumers as companies do not have the same level of freedom to operate and developed new technologies. On the other hand, allowing companies freehand to do as they please is a recipe for disaster as well, as profits need to be balanced with the benefit to the general population. This is one place where the U.S. has struggled, with healthcare companies often raising prices significantly enough that if you don't have private insurance, even a normal routine procedure can result in your life savings being drained at a moment's notice.Story continuesThe global healthcare industry, according to The Business Research Company, was worth $6.8 trillion in 2021 and was expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% to reach $7.5 trillion in 2022, which shows that there is a lot of potential for growth in the industry and identifying the companies leading this growth is important in making the best possible investment decisions. Innovation is the driver of success and according to fDi Intelligence, the healthcare industry is among the most innovative industries in the world. Many of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world are among the biggest R&amp;D spenders in the world, while from our list of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap, Siemens Healthineers is one of the highest spenders on R&amp;D, with 2020 expenses exceeding $1.5 billion, which was 9% of the company's total revenue.In the U.S., since universal healthcare does not exist, even a simple procedure can cost tens of thousands of dollars, which in a country where the federal minimum wage is $7.5 an hour, can easily bankrupt someone who doesn't have private insurance. And people who are on the low end of the totem pole in the corporate world or unemployed are more likely not to have insurance. The reason prices are so exorbitant is that insurance companies then haggle with hospitals or healthcare providers to reduce the charges, and a common price is agreed. While this is great news for healthcare companies, and this is why many of them earn hundreds of millions of dollars in profits if not billions, it is not as good for the actual patients, who have the added stress and tension of trying to pay off a bill with savings that they don't have.The presence of technology is ever-increasing in the healthcare industry, and if you're considering which companies have the highest potential for growth, just take a look at the companies increasingly adapting cutting-edge technology to provide innovative solutions in the industry. According to Forbes, the rate of technology adoptions in the healthcare industry increased significantly during the pandemic. More and more hospitals are implementing technological solutions. What seems run of the mill now was once groundbreaking technology, including IV pumps, patient monitors, ventilators and more. Correct implementation of technology will increase efficiency, which in turn means that the benefits of current resources will be maximized and hence, the bottom line will improve. It will be interesting to see in a few years which of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap utilize technology correctly to increase market share and their grip on an extremely profitable industry (see 10 best healthcare dividend stocks to buy).The healthcare segment has various divisions, which includes health insurance, pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare services providers and medical equipment among others. We excluded pharmaceutical companies from our ranking as they would absolutely dominate the list otherwise and claim four out of the top five positions. If you want to see the biggest drug companies in the world, please have a look here. To determine the market cap of the largest healthcare companies, we checked their market cap from Yahoo Finance, converting to USD the market cap of companies which were based outside the U.S. Just the 15 largest healthcare companies in the world have a market cap of over $1.1 trillion!

(NYSE:GS) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President &amp; COO, John Waldron, for US$5.2m worth of shares, at about US$387 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$346). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Specifically, insiders ditched US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$513m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

MAT is poised to benefit from product innovation, digital efforts and robust Hot Wheels sales. This and the emphasis on the cost-saving program bodes well. However, inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges are a concern.Let us discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Factors Likely to Drive GrowthMattel is likely to benefit from its strong product line-up that includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations. Moreover, its foray into other consumer product categories, such as apparel, fashion and accessories, bode well. The company has been undertaking efforts and focusing on better execution of marketing and promotional initiatives to bring back its flagship brands, Barbie and Fisher-Price, to their former positions. In fact, the company has formed a brand development framework to unlock the scale and profitability of its brands and modernize them for the digital world. Markedly, the company is making significant progress in transforming Mattel into an IP-driven high-performing toy company.Mattel continues to capture the full value of its IP and transform itself into a high-performing toy company. To this end, the company is leveraging its resources to relaunch its catalog IP, including Masters of the Universe, Matchbox and Monster High. Notably, the company is optimistic in this regard owing to its upside potential and built-in fan base. MAT is strengthening its partnership with major entertainment companies, including Disney, Microsoft, Nickelodeon, Nintendo, Universal, Warner Bros and WWE. Through the association, the company has licensing agreements for several highly-anticipated properties in 2022 and beyond.Robust Hot Wheels sales have impressed investors. The company has been witnessing an improving sales trend for Hot Wheels and is quite confident about the brand’s long-term prospects. During the third quarter 2022, gross billings at the Hot Wheels brand rose 13% (on a reported basis) and 17% (at constant currency basis) year over year. In North America and International Hot Wheels sales rose 2% and 26% year over year, respectively, on a reported basis.Mattel is also focusing on cost-saving efforts to boost its bottom line. Through its current cost-saving program, the company remains focused on expanding margins. It simplifies its organization structure, optimizing processes and supply chain to generate savings across operations. The program contributed $24 million of incremental savings to the cost of goods for the third quarter of 2022. The company anticipates the program and the integration of the Capital Light Program to deliver incremental savings of $80-$90 million in 2022 and additional savings of $250 million by 2023.ConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of Mattel have declined 19.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 8.7% fall. The downside was mainly caused by inflationary pressures, supply chain challenges and COVID-19-related disruptions, including temporary business closures, reduced retail traffic and local restrictions. In China, the company’s sales were affected by COVID-related retail closures during the third quarter of 2022. The company intends to monitor the situation regularly to gauge the impacts of COVID-19.Mattel has been continuously incurring increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. During the third quarter of 2022, the cost of sales increased 5% year over year. The increase in the cost of sales was driven by higher product and other costs, higher royalty expenses, and higher outbound freight and logistics expenses. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2022 declined because of cost inflation, primarily in raw materials, ocean freight, and other supply chain costs, and unfavorable foreign exchange. However, this was largely offset by favorable pricing actions and incremental realized savings from the Optimizing for Growth program. The company anticipates the challenging macroeconomic environment to persist for some time.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMattel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Schlumberger (SLB) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Schlumberger currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.2% and 15.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SLBBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SLBCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Schlumberger here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Schlumberger, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in SLB?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Schlumberger, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.7% over the past month to $2.15.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Schlumberger.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 72% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Leggett &amp; Platt. Check out our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Leggett &amp; Platt?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Leggett &amp; Platt does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Leggett &amp; Platt's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Leggett &amp; Platt is not owned by hedge funds. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 11% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 9.8% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Leggett &amp; PlattThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around US$59m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 27% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Leggett &amp; Platt. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

By comparison, an individual stock is unlikely to match market returns - and could well fall short. That's what happened in the case of Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS): its share price dropped 27% while the market declined 22%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 17% in that time.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Northern Trust While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Even though the Northern Trust share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.Northern Trust managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthNorthern Trust is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Northern Trust in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Northern Trust the TSR over the last 1 year was -25%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Northern Trust shareholders are down 25% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 22%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 0.2%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. If you would like to research Northern Trust in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

So how did the the movie perform on Netflix over the long holiday? Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal joins us now with the numbers. And Allie, it looks like it was a big hit.ALLIE CANAL: It was a big hit. 82.1 million hours streamed in the first three days on the Netflix platform since that December 23rd debut, but still, that is not enough to put this movie in the top five Netflix film debuts of all time. It actually secures it in sixth place behind Sandra Bullock's ""The Unforgivable,"" Ryan Gosling's ""The Gray Man."" The number one film debut is still ""Red Notice"" with nearly 149 million viewing hours in the first three days.But you mentioned that limited theatrical release over the Thanksgiving week, only about 600 theaters. It was not available in every state or every city. But industry insiders still estimated that the film brought in $13 million domestically. And we even heard from Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who said that they left a lot of money on the table by not extending this theatrical release.So considering the debut was so-so, I think they might revisit that strategy in 2023. All that being said, you know, this film could still add viewership throughout December into 2023. I know I'm going home tonight to watch this. I know a lot of people on our team have already binged this. We see we have a 93% critic and audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. So I think word of mouth will help add to this. But again, that debate between streamers' relationship with the box office, that's a big story that I'm going to be watching in 2023.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I always thought that, you know, Netflix doing this box office strategy kind of added a bit more oomph to the streaming side of things in terms of, like, getting kind of notoriety for the movies that are on the platform.]"

His fans and Ben Shapiro aren’t happy about it,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everyone-thinks-netflix-glass-onion-182817794.html,1672165697,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Filmmaker Rian Johnson gave the internet the best Christmas gift imaginable: Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery and another take-laden, zeitgeist-y pop culture moment fit for pointing and laughs.Glass Onion is the follow-up to Johnson's successful and beloved 2019 film Knives Out, starring Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. The sequel hit Netflix Dec. 23, just in time for everyone and their family to gather 'round and take in the two-hour murder mystery.That includes conservative media personality Ben Shapiro.On Monday, Shapiro spent 17 tweets ranting about (and spoiling) the plot and politics of the film. He hated both. Glass Onion centers around Edward Norton's tech billionaire Miles Bron, who invites a group of disparate friends to his private island for a COVID-19 lockdown murder mystery game (yes, there's an actual murder at the center of it) that ends up being, as Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc exasperates, ""so dumb.""Tech billionaires are all the rage these days, and Shapiro and other netizens are drawing conclusions between the metaphors and themes in Johnson's brazen billionaire and 2022's billionaire of the moment, Elon Musk.Musk, who lost a mind-boggling $132 billion in net worth this year, bought Twitter for $44 billion in October. It's fair to say the purchase has gone poorly—he has laid off thousands of Twitter employees, and been criticized for changing the social media's practices and implementing subscriptions. That's not to mention the week or so when users thought the platform might crash and disappear at any moment.It's gotten the point that many question whether Musk knows what he's doing running Twitter, and whether it would better served with someone else at the helm.The parallels in Johnson's Glass Onion are, admittedly, present, and people are taking to the platform Musk now owns to do really what Twitter does best: make jokes, be angry, and roast others with an opinion.Some called out Shapiro for his take. ""I love that Glass Onion is such a spot on skewering of Elon that Ben Shapiro is mad about it,"" tweeted Elizabeth Spiers. ""Just endlessly squeaking about it like a pet toy that's being stepped on repeatedly.""Story continues""Ben Shapiro being Very Very Angry that a whodunit misled the viewers in the first half is legit the funniest thing to happen in 2022,"" tweeted another.Others shared videos or memes to capture the spot on take of Musk.""Watched GLASS ONION again and I think it's beautiful that Rian Johnson was like ""I wonder if my class critique was a bit too subtle last time, let's just dedicate 2.5 hours to pointing and laughing at Elon Musk, the world's number one dumbass bitch,"" tweeted Abe Goldfarb.Johnson wrote the script for Glass Onion during the height of the pandemic lockdown, before Musk tweeted about buying Twitter. Johnson didn't write the film with Musk specifically as the archetype, but admitted in an interview with Wired magazine there's a clear taut string between them.""It’s very bizarre. I hope there isn’t some secret marketing department at Netflix that’s funding this Twitter takeover,"" Johnson told Wired. ""But obviously, it has almost a weird relevance in exactly the current moment. A friend of mine said, 'Man, that feels like it was written this afternoon.'

You can skip our industry analysis and go directly to the 5 Best Streaming Stocks To Buy Now.Almost every three decades, Hollywood undergoes a complete transformation. The shift from silent movies to talkies in the 1920s, the boom of broadcast television in the 1950s, the “I Want My MTV” cable from the 1980s, and the internet-based streaming services in the 2000s are all examples of these seismic transformations. The introduction of YouTube in 2005 by a group of ex-PayPal employees can be considered the spark of the streaming service era. YouTube, only after a year of its launch, was acquired by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for $1.65 billion, which seemed like an unnecessary investment at the time as the company had not generated any substantial profit, although, for corporations like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), it was clear that streaming is the next frontier in media entertainment.There are currently more than 200 streaming services available for consumers worldwide that offer all sorts of media entertainment, including videos, music, games, etc. With time, the streaming market is getting crowded and competitive, and companies are trying to be at the top by following new trends and ideas that might give them an edge over the others. One such trend is the localization of content that caters to the audience of a specific region through translations and subtitles of their favorite content in their respective languages. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently launched localized versions of its Amazon Prime in Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines to get its hold on Southeast Asia’s biggest market. Original content has also been the focus of these streaming services as an extension to localized content. Recently, original content production by streaming platforms has become popular. The Oscar-winning Korean movie “Parasite” by Amazon Prime, one of the most viewed Korean TV series “Squid Games” and the first German Netflix Show “Dark” by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) are a few examples of original content produced by streaming platforms.Story continuesThe shift to digitization after the outbreak of COVID-19 also served as a tailwind for the streaming industry. The subscriber count of streaming services skyrocketed during the pandemic as the world was almost entirely bound to their homes which increased the demand for streaming service providers. During the pandemic, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reached a milestone of 200 million subscribers, and Disney+, which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), hit a subscriber count of 100 million.In the coming years, the streaming service industry will continue to grow as the demand for both new content as well as revamped, and rebooted content keeps fueling the growth of the industry. In 2021, the global market size of the streaming service industry was valued at $375.1 billion. The market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 18.45% to reach $1,721.4 billion by 2030.Our MethodologyWe selected 11 best streaming stocks to buy now based purely on hedge fund sentiment towards those stocks.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) By 22%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-netflix-inc-nasdaq-130036430.html,1672146036,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Netflix The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.09bUS$3.44bUS$4.66bUS$6.63bUS$8.16bUS$9.53bUS$10.7bUS$11.7bUS$12.5bUS$13.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x17Analyst x13Analyst x8Analyst x4Est @ 23.11%Est @ 16.77%Est @ 12.33%Est @ 9.23%Est @ 7.05%Est @ 5.53% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$1.9kUS$3.0kUS$3.7kUS$5.0kUS$5.7kUS$6.2kUS$6.4kUS$6.5kUS$6.5kUS$6.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$51bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.0%) = US$243bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$243b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$118bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$169b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$295, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Netflix as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.995. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NetflixStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Oil Companies in the World. While as a whole, 2022 has been a difficult year for business, as firms have struggled with high costs and rising interest rates, some industries have fared much better than others due to to the tumultuous global economic environment. One such industry is the oil industry, which saw renewed interest after the push to renewables had ended up reducing its prospects and favorability among investors.The Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in tough sanctions against Russia by the U.S. government which aimed to stem the flow of funds to Moscow so that it couldn't fund its war. The Americans were followed by the British, who also banned all Russian hydrocarbon imports, with the European Union also pitching in by announcing a plan to reduce the imports. The sanctions however led to a meteoric rise in crude oil prices, as all those who stopped buying Russian oil had to look elsewhere to meet their energy demands. Brent crude oil prices, which were already rising before February due to the post pandemic recovery, soared to a massive $139 per barrel in March.Naturally, the higher the price of your product, the more profit you make, and oil companies bathed in billions of dollars of profits this year. The petro majors of the world, or the largest oil companies on the planet, namely Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) raked in $20 billion, $11 billion, $9.5 billion, and $8 billion in net income, which is the amount available to the firm after all of its expenses have been taken out. Saudi Aramco, which is one of the world's largest oil companies, brought in another $42 billion. These profits were met by criticism from the U.S. administration, who asked the American companies to increase their production in order to bring the prices down. However, the oil companies, beholden to their shareholders, did not increase capacity, countering that any capacity increase today will yield results years into the future - when oil will be much cheaper than it is today.Story continuesHowever, with 2022 coming to an end, crude oil prices have now reversed most of their gains and even entered into negative territory in late November. Primary reasons for this are the worries of a recession in the U.S. and other advanced economies and the Chinese struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic three years after the first case was reported.Today we will look at the biggest oil companies in the world, with the notable picks being Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation (SHA:600028.SS)20 Biggest Oil Companies in the WorldPhoto by David Thielen on UnsplashOur Methodology We studied the oil industry to sift out the largest firms in terms of their revenue.

The space has easily emerged as the best performing of all 11 U.S. market sectors, gaining nearly 57% so far in 2022. In contrast, the other 10 indexes have all suffered losses year to date. Meanwhile, the broader S&amp;P 500 benchmark is down more than 19% during this period.While Wall Street continues to be largely bullish on energy, the sector is notoriously volatile, with sudden positive surprises and crashes. Against this backdrop, it will be fruitful to invest in top-ranked companies that are trading below their true value before the broader market catches on.Taking this into account, Murphy USA MUSA, NexTier Oilfield Solutions NEX, Phillips 66 PSX, ProPetro Holding PUMP and Liberty Energy LBRT make the cut.Energy Defies Broader Market SelloffApart from a positive fundamental picture, the catalyst behind the energy markets’ strength could be attributed to geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Agreed, oil has pulled back from those lofty levels. However, the commodity still has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.Meanwhile, natural gas hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 earlier this year and is still trading some 75% higher year to date on the back of favorable weather and strong LNG shipments.Focus on Value StocksWhile the Energy sector can generate great returns when commodity prices go up and profits skyrocket, it is also exposed to heavy selling pressure when realizations crater. In other words, the oil and gas business is inherently cyclical, with delicate supply/demand balances, among others, determining their fortunes.Given this uncertainty, it will be wise for investors to apportion their funds in value stocks. Value investing has always been a popular strategy, and with a good reason too. Historical data suggests that value stocks not only tend to outperform growth stocks but are relatively less volatile.  Specifically, for investors who are risk-averse, value investing offers an opportunity to enter the market and grab stocks that have otherwise been overlooked by most, and are thus trading at cheap multiples.Story continuesOur ChoicesTo go with a Value Score of A, we have shortlisted companies with strong fundamentals.

As we announced today, John Klinger is being promoted to Chief Financial Officer at the beginning of our new fiscal year in late January. I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate John on his broader role, and I look forward to working more closely with him as we move forward. Scott is remaining with the Company as Senior Executive Vice President, Finance. I would like to recognize his long and extremely successful tenure as CFO for which we are enormously grateful. I cannot emphasize enough how beneficial Scott has been to me personally. He has truly been a great partner. We are very pleased that TJX will continue to benefit from both, John and Scott's expertise and leadership.I'll start today by thanking all of our global associates for their hard work and commitment to TJX. We truly appreciate their collective efforts to deliver great merchandise and values to our shoppers every day. Now to our results. I am very pleased with our third quarter performance. Once again, we delivered strong profitability and a terrific merchandise margin. On the top line, our better-than-expected U.S. comp sales were driven by the excellent performance at Marmaxx, particularly its apparel business, where sales were strong. Our third quarter results once again highlight the outstanding execution of our flexible business model by our very talented associates. While our business is not immune to macro factors, I am convinced that the flexibility of our off-price retail model and the depth of our expertise and experience, especially within our merchant organization, will remain an important advantage for us.As we enter the fourth quarter, we're in a terrific position to take advantage of the tremendous buying environment and to flow fresh exciting assortments to our stores and online this holiday season. We have many initiatives planned to drive sales and our value proposition remains very strong. Further, we are convinced that our great values will continue to resonate with consumers whose wallets remain stretched. Medium and longer term, we remain extremely confident that TJX is well-positioned to gain market share and become an even more profitable company. I'll talk more about our holiday plans and our opportunities beyond 2022 in a moment. Before I continue, though, I'll turn the call over to Scott to cover our third quarter financial results in more detail.Scott?See also 10 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy and 15 Companies That Offer Pensions.Scott Goldenberg: Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some additional details on the third quarter. Third quarter consolidated pretax margin of 11.2% was up 20 basis points versus last year. Third quarter pretax margin exceeded the high end of our guidance, largely due to the timing of some expenses. Our plans for the fourth quarter assume that most of this benefit will reverse out. Aside from the timing of expenses, the other components of our pretax margin were essentially in line with the high end of our plan. Merchandise margin was flat, despite 120 basis points of incremental freight pressure. Within merchandise margin, we saw a significant benefit from markon, mostly due to better buying. Incremental wage costs continued to be a headwind to pretax margin with a negative impact of 80 basis points this quarter.Third quarter U.S. comp store sales decreased 2% and exceeded our expectations. As a reminder, we were anniversarying an outsized 16% U.S. open-only comp increase last year, which was versus fiscal '20. When added together, our comp would represent a 14% increase on a 3-year stack basis. Further, U.S. comp sales improved each month of the quarter on that same 3-year stack basis. Excluding foreign exchange, third quarter total sales would have been at the high end of our guidance. For the third quarter, U.S. average basket was up. U.S. customer traffic was down, but strengthened as the quarter progressed and improved versus the second quarter. Lastly, adjusted earnings per share were $0.86. Again, this was above the high end of our guidance, largely due to a benefit from the timing of some expenses, and our plans for the fourth quarter assume that most of this benefit will reverse out.Now to our divisional results. At Marmaxx, third quarter segment profit margin was 13.5%. Comp store sales increased 3% versus an 11% open-only comp increase last year. Marmaxx's comp sales were positive each month and improved throughout the quarter. Again, it was great to see a strong comp increase in Marmaxx's apparel business. Once again, Marmaxx's average basket increased as it has throughout the year. While customer traffic was down, Marmaxx saw improvement each month of the quarter and versus the second quarter. At HomeGoods, third quarter segment profit margin was 8.9%. The segment profit margin improvement versus the first half of this year was mostly due to a significant moderation of the year-over-year impact of incremental freight costs.Comp store sales decreased 16% versus a 34% open-only comp increase last year when we saw an outsized -- when we saw outsized spending in home-related categories. HomeGoods' average basket increased slightly. At TJX Canada, we are pleased with the overall -- with their overall performance, particularly their strong profitability. Third quarter segment profit margin was 15.8%, exceeding their fiscal '20 margin. Overall sales on a constant currency basis were up 4% in the third quarter. Further, third quarter Canadian sales growth also improved each month of the quarter when compared to fiscal '20. At TJX International, third quarter segment profit margin was 6.7%, despite some deleverage from lower sales. Pretax margin was essentially in line versus fiscal '20 due to better buying and expense management, which mostly offset incremental freight wage and other expense pressures.Overall sales on a constant currency basis were down 1% from the third quarter. Moving to inventory. Our balance sheet inventory was up 26% versus the third quarter last year. This is higher than we expected due to early receipts of merchandise as the supply chain continued to improve. On a per-store basis, inventory was up 31% on a constant currency basis. We are very comfortable with our balance sheet and store inventory levels when compared to fiscal '20. Importantly, overall store inventory turns and markdowns are in line with our fiscal '20 levels. We still have plenty of liquidity and are in excellent position to take advantage of the great buying environment, including packaway opportunities. I'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions.During the third quarter, we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash. In the third quarter, we returned $843 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. Now, I will turn it back to Ernie.Ernie Herrman: Thanks, Scott. Now, I'd like to highlight the opportunities we see to drive traffic and sales in the fourth quarter. First, in this inflationary environment, we believe it is important as ever to deliver shoppers excellent value throughout the store and online every time they visit. This is our top priority, and I am confident that our banners will be a destination for consumers seeking great value this holiday season. Second, as I've been saying all year long, the marketplace is absolutely loaded with quality branded merchandise across good, better and best brands. Importantly, this has set us up very well to offer an excellent assortment of branded gifts this holiday season that we believe will excite and inspire our shoppers.Third, I want to highlight that we plan to flow fresh product to our stores and online multiple times a week, which is a key differentiator of our business compared to many other retailers. With the rapidly changing merchandise mix, I am confident that shoppers are going to be very satisfied with the gift assortments they see every time they visit. Our store teams are excellent at managing this flow and creating fresh organized shopping presentations throughout our stores. Next, we feel great about our holiday marketing campaigns that just launched. We believe these campaigns can help drive traffic from both, new and existing shoppers across each of our banners. This year, each of our divisions will reinforce our value leadership and emphasize that shoppers can get more for their money when they visit.We are also highlighting the fresh flow of merchandise throughout the holiday season with messaging such as Spend Less, Get More, All Season Long. In the U.S. and Canada, we are leveraging the strengths of our retail brand portfolio and multi-banner campaigns, helping to drive efficiencies and building awareness. Further, for all our retail banners, we have strong comprehensive marketing plans in place to help us stand out. Lastly, the flexibility of our business model has allowed us to successfully operate our business against some level of retail promotion every year for the past 46 years. I really want to emphasize that we are extremely confident that we can manage through any type of promotional environment that we may see from other retailers in the fourth quarter and beyond.Looking beyond this year, we are convinced that we are set up very well to capitalize on the growth opportunities we see for our business in the medium and long term. On the top line, we believe we are well positioned to capture additional market share. We see many opportunities to drive sales and traffic as we attract a wide range of customers across many income demographics, which we believe is a key advantage of our business. Further, we have substantial store growth potential remaining in our current geographies around the world. In a retail environment where overall pricing has been reset higher, we believe our value proposition will be even more compelling and visible to consumers and that our treasure hunt shopping experience will hold tremendous appeal.I want to reiterate our continued confidence in product availability to support our long-term growth plans. Throughout our history, availability of quality-branded inventory has never been an issue for us. Our more than 1,200 buyers source from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors and from over 100 countries. There has always been significantly more merchandise in the marketplace than we could buy, and we expect that to continue. As to our profitability outlook, we remain committed to returning to our fiscal 2020 pretax margin level. To be clear, that would be a 10.6% pretax margin by fiscal 2025. Over the next two years, our plans assume additional merchandise margin opportunities across all of our divisions. We also expect our overall expense headwinds to moderate and that freight will be a tailwind next year.Lastly, this outlook assumes that our overall comp store sales will return to a low single-digit increase in each of the next two years. Turning to corporate responsibility. I am pleased to share with you that our 2022 global corporate responsibility report was published this past quarter and is available on tjx.com. This report summarizes our fiscal 2022 initiatives and progress within our four areas of focus, which are workplace, communities, environmental sustainability and responsible business. The report includes an appendix of ESG data and maps our work and disclosures to a variety of ESG standards and frameworks, including The Global Reporting Initiative, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.We're proud to continue to make progress in our programs and initiatives, and I'm grateful to our teams around the globe for the work they do to support our global priorities. As always, we invite you to visit tjx.com to read our full report, and we'll continue to update the site over the next year. In closing, I want to again thank all of our associates around the world for their hard work that led to our strong results in the third quarter. Our teams have put us in an excellent position this holiday season. I am convinced that we have some of the best talent in all of retail and across all areas of the business. Further, I believe their depth of off-price knowledge and expertise is unmatched and has driven our strong execution. I truly believe our associates will continue to be a major advantage for TJX going forward.I'm convinced that the flexibility of our off-price model and our commitment to value set us apart and have allowed us to successfully operate in many different economic, retail and promotional environments. While we are impacted by macro factors, we have historically outperformed in both, good and bad environments throughout our 45-plus-year history. We are confident that we can execute on our short- and long-term growth plans to build TJX into an increasingly profitable $60 billion plus revenue company. Now, I'll turn the call back to Scott to cover our full year and fourth quarter guidance. And then, we'll open it up for questions. Scott?Scott Goldenberg: Thanks again, Ernie. I'll start with the full year. We increased our outlook for full year U.S. comp sales and now expect them to be down 1% to down 2% versus our previous guidance of down 2% to down 3%. This guidance now reflects the flow-through of our above-plan third quarter U.S. comp sales and our increased expectations for the fourth quarter. For the full year, we're now planning total TJX sales in the range of $49.3 billion to $49.5 billion. The change versus our previous guidance is due to our forecast that unfavorable foreign exchange rates will negatively impact our fourth quarter reported sales. For full year adjusted pretax margins, we're anticipating a range of 9.8% to 9.9%, maintaining the high end of our full year margin guidance.For full year adjusted earnings per share, we now expect a range of $3.07 to $3.11 million, which is up 8% to 9% over last year's adjusted $2.85. The change to the high end versus our previous guidance is due to an incremental $0.02 negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Excluding this foreign exchange incremental foreign exchange impact, the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance would be unchanged. For modeling purposes, for the full year, we're currently anticipating approximately 130 basis points of incremental freight expense and 70 basis points of incremental wage costs. Also, we're assuming an adjusted tax rate of 25.3%, net interest expense of approximately $10 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.18 billion.We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and stock repurchase programs. In fiscal '23, we continue to expect to buy back 2.25 to 2.50 of TJX stock. Now to the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we are increasing our plan for U.S. comp store sales to be flat to up 1% over an outsized 13% U.S. open-only comp store sales increase last year. Next, we are planning total fourth quarter TJX sales in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, we're now assuming -- in the fourth quarter, we're now planning pretax margin in the range of 9.5% to 9.8%. This outlook now assumes that most of our third -- the third quarter timing of expenses -- the expense benefit will reverse out in the fourth quarter.For modeling purposes, in the fourth quarter, we're currently expecting a headwind from incremental wage costs and for freight to be flat. We're also anticipating a tax rate of 24.9%, net interest income of approximately $19 million, and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.17 billion. As a result of all of these assumptions, we're planning fourth quarter EPS of $0.85 to $0.89 per share. This outlook now assumes that most of the third quarter timing of benefit -- of expense benefits will reverse out in the fourth quarter and also reflects an expected unfavorable impact due to foreign exchange rates. In closing, I want to highlight that we are in great position operationally and financially to grow our business. We have a very strong balance sheet and continue to generate outstanding cash flow.Further, we are set up extremely well to continue making important investments to support the growth of our business while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders. Now, we're happy to take your questions. And as we do every quarter, we're going to ask that you please limit your questions to one per person, so we can keep the call on schedule and commence our questions from as many analysts as we can. Thanks. And now, we will open it up for questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide TJX Companies with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Quickly Is TJX Companies Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. TJX Companies managed to grow EPS by 4.6% per year, over three years. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note TJX Companies achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 8.0% to US$49b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for TJX Companies?Story continuesAre TJX Companies Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of TJX Companies, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$152m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does TJX Companies Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for TJX Companies is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for TJX Companies (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

115,248a8cf8-937d-35ea-874c-f1f2823cdc93,AMGN,2022-12-28,Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 82%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-favorite-120031739.html,1672228831,STORY,['AMGN'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amgen. View our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Amgen. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amgen, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amgen. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of AmgenThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Amgen Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$221m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Amgen. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Amgen   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Bitcoin has cratered over 65%. But gold? It’s up 1.3%. The classic inflation hedge has worked its magic in a wild year for investors, but it wasn’t the strong performance many goldbugs were expecting.The lack of impressive returns has mostly been the result of central banks worldwide hiking interest rates aggressively to fight inflation. Rising rates have increased the value of gold’s competition—the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries—leading prices to stagnate under $2,000 per troy ounce.“What should have been smooth sailing for gold became the perfect storm,” Mobeen Tahir, an investment strategist at WisdomTree, explained in a CNBC interview last week. “A rising U.S. dollar and rising Treasury yields became headwinds for gold.”But in recent weeks, with the strength of the U.S. dollar fading, gold prices have surged to a six-month high. And the precious metal got another boost from China’s decision to further ease its COVID-19 restrictions this week.Gold futures rose roughly 1% to $1,822 per troy ounce on Tuesday after trading as high as $1,838 in the morning hours.Analysts believe gold will see a demand boost as China, the world's largest single market for the metal, reopens. There are also a slew of potential tailwinds for gold heading into next year.If the Federal Reserve pauses or slows the pace of its rate hikes, treasury yields fall, or U.S. economic data deteriorates while inflation remains high, gold will outperform.“These are sort of Goldilocks conditions for gold. Perfect for conditions for gold,” Tahir said.But in the World Gold Council’s 2023 Gold Outlook, analysts said they expect a “a stable but positive performance for gold” next year amid competing headwinds and tailwinds.On one hand, mild recessions tend to bode well for gold, as do a weakening U.S. dollar and rising geopolitical tensions. On the other, inflation is set to fall in 2023, which may lead investors toward riskier assets.Story continues“Lower inflation should mean potentially diminished interest in gold from an inflation-hedging perspective,” the analysts wrote.Higher bond yields have also historically driven investors away from gold, but the World Gold Council’s analysts said they believe yields aren’t high enough to hurt prices significantly.“Although higher bond yields are associated with lower gold returns and might now be deemed attractive by some investors, current yield levels are historically not a hindrance to gold doing well, particularly when accounting for a weaker U.S. dollar,” they wrote.For investors, WisdomTree’s Tahir noted, it’s important to remember that “every gold rally has a silver lining.”“We may see a lot of investors express their bullish view on gold via silver next year,” he said, noting that the two precious metals often move in tandem, with silver commonly seeing better returns.Silver prices rose nearly 1.5% on Tuesday and are up roughly 15% over the past month.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches—living with mom and dadMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

The real slid 1.0% against a rebounding dollar . Central bank data showed borrowing costs in bank loans in Brazil rose in November to the highest level in more than five years, while default ratios continued to grow, under the effects of an aggressive monetary tightening cycle to tame inflation.

The real has been the best performing currency in the region, up 5.7% so far this year. Financial markets had been expecting the central bank's benchmark rate - currently at 13.75% - to fall in March but they have started to price in a rate hike since Lula presented his social package, which bypasses the constitutional spending cap and which Congress approved last week. ""The peak of CPI inflation is past us, disinflation is in progress, however the risks are present, specially from the fiscal fundamentals,"" said analysts at Rabobank in a note.

The deaths threaten to keep anger fired up despite a lull in violence over the festive period in the heavily Catholic country.The clashes with the Dec. 7 ouster of former president Pedro Castillo after he tried to illegally dissolve Congress to avoid an impeachment vote he feared losing. He was voted out of office shortly after and arrested for alleged ""rebellion"". He denies the charges.His arrest triggered an outpouring of anger at the country's political elite and Congress, widely reviled as corrupt and self-serving, especially in Peru's poor southern mining regions where rising food and energy costs have hit people hard.As new President Dina Boluarte tried to stem the protests, which saw blockades of highways, buildings set on fire and airports invaded, the government declared a nationwide state of emergency on Dec. 14, curtailing some civic rights and allowing the armed forces to support the police maintaining public order.A day later on Dec. 15 protesters in Ayacucho invaded the runway of the regional airport, a block away from Prado's garage, where he lived and worked on Calle Los Angeles, which ran parallel to the airstrip. The airport was forced to suspend flights.The army was sent in to wrest back control.Story continuesA security camera near the airport shows protesters invading the runway around 2 p.m., some throwing rocks and burning tires while troops gathered. Military helicopters circled above. The public ombudsman said gas grenades were thrown onto protesters below.By 5 p.m. the violence spread outside the limits of the airport, and the shooting in the streets began. By the end of the night the clashes would leave 10 people dead or fatally wounded. The most recent died on Dec. 21.At 5.55 p.m., security camera footage from a store on Calle Los Angeles opposite Prado's home shows a group of protesters and others standing in the street.The crowd is suddenly startled by something off camera and starts running. On the sidewalk on the far side of the road a person falls and lies still. A group of people come to check on the person, including Edgar who is seen walking the opposite way from the crowd and seemingly out of the entrance to his home. He kneels over the person and stays with them while others run off.A minute later the footage shows Edgar is shot and collapses. He died the next morning on Dec. 16 from hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock, pulmonary and hepatic lacerations, and open chest trauma caused by a gunshot to the chest, according to his autopsy.""The military is supposedly trained to fight terrorism, not take the lives of our residents,"" his sister Edith told Reuters, adding that he had not been involved in the protests. ""He was basically murdered by the military.""She said Edgar left the house he shares with her after gunfire hit their gate and he saw protesters being hurt, a narrative that appears to tally with footage seen by Reuters. She showed Reuters bullet casings and marks on the door frame.""The only thing I want is justice for my brother.""LETHAL FORCE A 'LAST RESORT'The military say they had come under serious attack, which gave them cause to respond with force.At 1 p.m. on Dec. 15 a military unit that was heading from the town center to the Ayacucho airport was attacked by a crowd with ""blunt objects, explosives and handmade firearms"", the armed forced said in a statement a day after.This, the army said, put the troop's ""physical integrity at risk"" and that they acted within ""established legal procedure, strictly applying current norms regarding the use of force"".Peru's military regulations say that in a state of emergency, members of the armed forces can use firearms ""in self defense or defense of other people, in the case of imminent risk of death or severe injury, or to avoid particularly dangerous crimes that pose a threat to life.""It also says use of lethal force should be a ""last resort"".Reuters made repeated attempts to interview Peruvian police and military leaders by phone and in person. A reporter went to the military base in Ayacucho to speak to the local general in charge of operations, but was denied access.The United Nations has called for investigations into child casualties in the protests. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has condemned violence by both security forces and protesters and called for dialogue.The deaths have become a lightning rod for anger in poor Andean and Amazonian areas, when many feel overlooked despite local oil and copper wealth. Many want major political change and constitutional reform.""They aimed bullets of war at our brothers,"" said Rocio Leandro Melgar, a protest leader in Ayacucho, who blamed the government for allowing the violence to happen.""We'll keep moving forward, things can't stay like this.""'GUNFIRE EVERYWHERE'Other footage from a security camera at a parking garage near the airport shared with Reuters shows a man standing next to a building looking up the road. Something strikes his arm and he runs to hide behind a tree.A few seconds later a second man is seen running through the tree-lined plaza opposite. The person runs across the road towards the parking garage camera and suddenly falls to the ground still. The owner of the parking garage said the person died.Multiple residents in the same neighborhood surrounding the airport said sporadic gunfire continued well into the night.Edith Aguilar says her son, Jose Luis, 20, was working at a local soft drinks factory until 6.30 p.m. on the day of the protests and was killed on his way home from work. Autopsy reports shared with Reuters show he died from severe head trauma from a gunshot.""There was gunfire everywhere,"" Aguilar, who lives in the area around the airport said. ""You couldn't even go outside.""Aguilar said her sister-in-law called her asking whether her son had made it home. She had seen him walking in the street earlier and had heard someone matching his description had been killed.""My son was coming back from work,"" Aguilar said. ""It's a lie, those people who say we're terrorists.""The most recent fatality, 19-year-old Jhonathan Alarcon, died from internal bleeding on Dec. 21, a week after he was shot in the hip during the Ayacucho protests, according to his aunt who spoke to Reuters and data from Peru's ombudsman.In an act of protest, his family on Dec. 22 took his coffin to the plaza where he was shot, laying it on the ground while a band played music. One mourner shouted protest slogans from a megaphone underneath a big red banner commemorating the victims of what it called a ""massacre"".""They didn't need to shoot like that,"" Luzmila Alarcon, Jhonathan's aunt who also attended the protest, told Reuters at his memorial service. ""It looked like a clash between soldiers, but it was citizens versus the military.""She said the deaths would spur more anger as people looked to find someone to hold accountable.""It can't be possible that no government or no authority takes responsibility for this,"" she said. ""They weren't stray bullets or accidents. They were direct shots by the military ... This isn't the way to calm the population.""(Reporting by Alexander Villegas; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Daniel Wallis)]"

Despite recent setbacks in Peru and Argentina, left-wing governments in the region rule at the highest rate in over two decades, in what has come to be known as the second “pink tide.”A resurgence of the far-left surge of the late 1990s, newly-elected leaders across the region have prioritized environmental issues, blaming neoliberal policies for fueling the climate crisis and contributing to worsening inequality.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureAfter victories in the five largest economies in Latin America, the left-wing governments have the chance to enact meaningful forestry, agricultural, and energy reforms over the course of next year and beyond. Here’s a look at their plans, and the challenges they face.Charted: Latin America’s pink tidedatawrapper-chart-Fm30iSeeing the Amazon forest for the treesSince the onset of his presidential campaign, Lula has stressed the importance of reversing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, pledging to undo the environmental destruction seen under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.Lula was largely successful at turning the tide of deforestation during his previous term as president, cracking down on illegal logging and creating new methods to track forest loss. In 2004, the year after he took office, the Amazon lost 7 million acres of trees. By 2012, a year after the end of his tenure, the annual losses were down to 1.1 million acres. That number rose precipitously after the new Bolsonaro administration weakened a number of laws regulating loggers and agricultural businesses. During his first three years in office, the Amazon lost 8.4 million acres, a 52% increase over the previous three-year period. As the world’s largest carbon sink, preserving and repopulating rainforests like the Amazon is essential to achieving the climate goals of the Paris agreement.Story continuesLula has argued that Brazil can remain a major agricultural producer without needing to clear another acre of rainforest, pledging to eventually reach zero deforestation in the Amazon. To get there, Lula will have to work with a hostile congress and weakened environmental institutions.Mexico’s saying no to GMOIn 2021, Mexico’s president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as AMLO) announced plans to phase out imports of genetically-modified corn by 2024, excluding production meant for livestock. AMLO campaigned on a promise to ban genetically-modified crops in Mexico, deeming them detrimental to traditional agricultural practices and possibly hazardous to human health. He has stated that the ban on corn is a first step towards promoting organic, regenerative agriculture in Mexico.An unprecedented decision in the Americas, US farmers have repeatedly claimed that this trade restriction breaks the USMCA, the free trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the US. While open to negotiations, the Mexican government has stated its intention to protect itself in a possible trade dispute with the US and Canada, an already tenuous relationship after a recent disagreement over Mexico’s nationalized energy sources.AMLO has also pushed for a ban on the common herbicide glysophate, a key ingredient in Monsanto’s popular weedkiller, that has been linked to cancer. Colombia, where glysophate has been sprayed over coca plantations as part of the country’s war on drugs, imposed a ban on the substance in 2015, a decision that turned into a long court battle. The country’s newly elected leftist president Gustavo Petro plans to expand this ban as he rethinks Colombia’s approach to the war on drugs, including proposals to decriminalize cocaine and end all aerial spraying of coco plants.The environmental degradation caused by illegal mining practices in the Madre De Dios province of Peru.Canary in the metal minesPedro Castillo’s ousting earlier this month put an abrupt end to his term as Peru’s first indigenous president, and spurred a series of fervent protests in the rural, poor communities that made up much of his support. Castillo’s supporters accuse multinational corporations and establishment politicians of sabotaging the socialist leader, while his opponents say he was a destabilizing figure and a threat to democracy.The demonstrations have been largely concentrated in mining communities around the country, where poor, mostly indigenous workers are employed by foreign companies for low wages. Castillo promised aggressive mining reforms during his campaign and supported a number of strikes and blockades during his time in office. One of the world’s largest exporters of copper and gold, Peru is also one of the poorest and most unequal countries in Latin America.Next door in Chile, the government of left-wing president Gabriel Boric campaigned on an aggressive overhaul to the tax code focused on foreign mining companies. Recently, the Chilean government floated a 1% increase on copper mining royalties for any company that produces more than 50,000 tons per year, and a 4% increase for companies with production over 200,000 tons, with all new revenue redirected to newly-enacted social welfare programs.In response, a number of mining companies have threatened to pull out their investments, while Boric has repeatedly vowed to pass aggressive environmental regulations in the industry and create a state-owned lithium company.Venezuela only talks the talkPresident Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela struck a forceful tone at the COP27 conference in November, denouncing the extraction of natural resources in service of unrestrained capitalism as the root cause of climate change. “The cause [of climate change] is the dream of seeking to find happiness in accumulating possessions,” Maduro said, quoting his political mentor and predecessor Hugo Chávez. “People think they have a right to grab and own and destroy anything that stands in their way to accumulating capital.”Missing from the speech? Any mention of Venezuela’s current oil industry, which produces more than 2 million barrels of oil each day. Once the richest economy in South America, the petrostate is still among the largest exporters of oil in the world, even after a series of strict sanctions on the industry were imposed by the US and other Western nations in recent years.Additionally, Venezuela has the fastest-growing rate of deforestation in Latin America. This is mainly due to Maduro’s 2016 decision to open up the massive Orinoco region bordering the Brazilian Amazon for the mining of gold and other valuable minerals. Reports from the region include gang warfare, heavily polluted rivers, and a largely avoidable malaria epidemic.Venezuela’s poor environmental record notwithstanding, the US has recently opened up to reconsider part of the sanctions imposed on the country under the Trump administration in a bid to compensate for the sanctions-hit Russian crude. As Venezuela faces a series of political, economic, and social challenges, it looks like environmental progress will be put on the back burner.Related Stories:🪓 Brazil is failing to stop illegal logging of the Amazon💊 In Colombia, women’s health paid the price of misguided drug control policies🛢️ The Tienditas bridge serves as a powerful symbol of improving ties between Venezuela and ColombiaMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on General Dynamics’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics Is General Dynamics Still Cheap?Good news, investors! General Dynamics is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $370.52, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, General Dynamics’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will General Dynamics generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. General Dynamics' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 33%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since GD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GD for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GD.

Gambling businesses and casino companies range from small operations to large and multinational companies.According to the American Gaming Association (AGA), U.S. commercial gaming revenue touched quarterly record of $15.17 billion in the third quarter of 2022. As a result, this beats the previous record of $14.81 billion in Q2 2022 by approximately 2%. Given the trend in initial 9 months of 2022, the year should be able to surpass 2021 as the highest-grossing commercial gaming revenue year ever. For the 9 months of 2022, U.S. commercial gaming revenue tracks 14.7% ahead of the same period of the previous year and has outpaced full-year revenue for FY19.

It saw net revenues of $133.7 million in the third quarter of 2022, exhibiting 19.8% growth in comparison to $111.6 million in Q3 2021.

(NASDAQ:PENN) has posted its results for Q3 2022. The company’s revenues grew 7.5% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, while net income came at $123.2 million. The company’s strong retail results stemmed from ongoing database growth and sound margin performance.During Q3 2022, the company repurchased 5,348,809 shares of its common stock for $168.0 million.

(NASDAQ:PENN). Here is what the fund has to say:“Shares of gaming company PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) declined 9.6% in the quarter and penalized performance by 10 bps. This was due to investor concerns that a potential recession would result in a slowdown or decline in its earnings growth rate. However, thus far, the company has seen no material change to visitation or spending levels, and its earnings remain strong. PENN is generating strong cash flow, which it continues to use to invest in its digital growth opportunity, while using excess cash to buy back its stock. PENN is well positioned to weather a slowdown or recession, and we believe that even if one does occur, the company would still generate revenue and EBITDA above pre-pandemic levels. We consider the $50 million of losses this year from its digital business to be modest in relation to PENN’s over $1 billion of EBITDA from its casino business. The losses from its digital business represent customer acquisition costs incurred as additional states legalize online gambling. Since it is far less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, we expect marketing costs to decline as PENN builds its customer base. PENN’s core bricks and mortar casino business remains strong, and the company’s healthy regional casino business and strong balance sheet enable it to absorb its digital losses.”6. VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 33VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust based in the US. The company owns, acquires, and develops real estate assets across hospitality, gaming, entertainment and leisure destinations.Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. and VICI Properties Inc.

(NYSE:VICI) saw total revenues coming at $751.5 million, exhibiting 100.0% growth against $375.7 million in Q3 2021.

They gave an “Overweight” rating on October 24.Meridian Funds, managed by ArrowMark Partners, published its second quarter 2022 investor letter and included VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI). Here is what the fund stated:“VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust company specializing in casinos and other entertainment properties. We invested in VICI in 2018 when earnings were declining due to dilutive acquisitions. Our thesis was that, as investors grew more comfortable with casinos as a REIT subsector, the value of their properties would increase. We also liked the defensive characteristics of the company, specifically the triple-net lease structure, which dictates that lessees pay all maintenance and capital expenditures, and the history of casino REITs with zero rent payments missed by casinos during either the global financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic. Furthermore, we were confident that VICI’s growth prospects would increase as more casinos monetized land holdings with VICI’s ability to use its extensive cash and liquidity to make acquisitions. VICI’s stock outperformed in the quarter due to its appeal as a fairly defensive investment and the news that it would be included in the S&amp;P 500 Index. We maintained our position in VICI.”Click to continue reading and see 5 best Las Vegas stocks to buy now. Suggested articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy15 Biggest Gambling Countries in the World10 Best Cannabis Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 11 Best Las Vegas Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Assertio has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Zoetis has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that ASRT's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ASRT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.29, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 29.86. We also note that ASRT has a PEG ratio of 0.73. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.76.Another notable valuation metric for ASRT is its P/B ratio of 1.46. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 14.57.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ASRT's Value grade of A and ZTS's Value grade of C.Story continuesASRT sticks out from ZTS in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ASRT is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here, we engage different perspectives to solve complex challenges - together.Acquiring and retaining top talent is a priority for us. Not only do we continuously evaluate our job opportunities to ensure they're competitive, we also:Mitigate unconscious biases in the hiring process by removing resume details that may convey a candidate's gender identity, race, religion, or socioeconomic background.Implement more inclusive corporate hiring practices such as eliminating degree requirements where appropriate.Seek to provide competitive levels of compensation and benefits, as benchmarked against peers, to ensure incentives are properly aligned with business needs and to enable us to attract and retain qualified employees.The next generation of energy engineers and sustainability practitionersIn collaboration with Prairie View A&amp;M, a historically black college and university in Texas, NRGlaunched an initiative to support the university's engineering program and provide students hands-on learning opportunities with NRG executives and industry subject matter experts. This climate-focused course opportunity has recently expanded from mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering to include the agriculture, chemical, and civil engineering disciplines.A key outcome of the course is the empowerment of underrepresented engineering students with the commercial dexterity necessary to apply artificial intelligence and data analytics education to real world decarbonization challenges, engineering problems, and business issues.

Veterans' individual accountability and past teamwork are also invaluable assets for business leaders.Cultivating talentWe are committed to developing leaders who can refine and execute our strategy, driving value for our stakeholders. Management regularly updates its leadership and succession plans, including engaging with the Board to identify candidates for key senior leadership positions.When employees are valued, feel heard, and are empowered daily, we foster a successful, collaborative environment.

You can skip our overview and go directly to the 5 Best Stocks In Each Sector.When it comes to investing in the stock market, having a diversified portfolio certainly does wonders for long-term investors. There is an old adage, ""Don't put all of your eggs in one basket,"" and it is often quoted by legendary investors like Warren Buffett, underscoring the importance of having a diversified portfolio.What is diversification, you may ask? Diversification involves mitigating risk by investing in a variety of relatively less correlated assets/industries. Diversification can greatly help to reduce risk and improve the potential for long-term returns. When it comes to investment in the stock market, diversification can be achieved by investing in a range of stocks from different sectors, industries, and geographic regions.There are several benefits to diversification in stock investing:Risk reduction: By spreading investments across a variety of stocks, the risk of loss is reduced as the performance of one stock is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall portfolio. This is because the returns of different stocks tend to be uncorrelated, meaning they are not influenced by the same factors.Improved returns: While diversification may reduce the risk of loss, it can also potentially lead to improved returns over the long term. This is because a diversified portfolio is more likely to capture the overall performance of the market rather than being reliant on the performance of a single stock or sector.Flexibility: Diversification allows investors to adjust their portfolios to changing market conditions by adding or removing stocks as needed. This flexibility can help investors to capitalize on opportunities and minimize potential losses.Warren Buffett famously made a bet on the S&amp;P500 that the market index would beat the returns generated through active investing by hedge fund managers. To no surprise, Warren Buffett came out as a winner as no hedge fund was able to beat the market from the period of January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017.Story continuesAlthough 2022 was not a good year for the stock market in general, there were certain sectors that generated high returns for investors. Energy stocks, for example, soared as oil and gas prices skyrocketed after the war in Ukraine and the increased global demand. In 2022, The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index returned a whopping 63% to investors, including dividends. Value stocks provided solid returns to investors as growth stocks came under pressure from the rising interest rates. The S&amp;P 500 Value Index, although is down 5.1% YTD on a total return basis, it outperformed the broader S&amp;P 500 index substantially, which is down ∼20% YTD.Our MethodologyTo come up with 11 best stocks in each sector, we have picked the most popular stock amongst hedge funds from each industry outlined by the MSCI.

(NYSE:NEE), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NextEra Energy, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NextEra Energy?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NextEra Energy. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of NextEra Energy, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NextEra Energy. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. With 7.2% and 5.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of NextEra Energy, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$265m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 21% stake in NextEra Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  NextEra Energy is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those shouldn't be ignored...If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Miami led the way with a 21% year-over-year price increase, followed by Tampa in second with a 20.5% increase, and Charlotte in third with a 15% increase. All 20 cities reported lower price increases in the year ending October 2022 versus the year ending September 2022.MONTH-OVER-MONTHBefore seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a -0.5% month-over-month decrease in October, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites posted decreases of -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively.After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a month-over-month decrease of -0.3%, and the 10-City and 20-City Composites both posted decreases of -0.5%.In October, all 20 cities reported declines before and after seasonal adjustments.ANALYSIS""October 2022 marked the fourth consecutive month of declining home prices in the U.S.,"" says Craig J. Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI. ""For example, the National Composite Index fell -0.5% for the month, reflecting a -3.0% decline since the market peaked in June 2022. We saw comparable patterns in our 10- and 20-City Composites, both of which stand -4.6% below their June peaks after October declines of -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively. These declines, of course, came after very strong price increases in late 2021 and the first half of 2022. Despite its recent weakness, on a year-over-year basis the National Composite gained 9.2%, which is in the top quintile of historical performance levels.Story continues""Despite considerable regional differences, all 20 cities in our October report reflect these trends of short-term decline and medium-term deceleration. Prices declined in every city in October, with a median change of -0.9%. Year-over-year price gains in all 20 cities were lower in October than they had been in September; the median year-over-year increase across the 20 cities was 8.3%.""October's best-performing cities were Miami (+21.0% year-over-year) and Tampa (+20.5%), with Charlotte (+15.0%) edging Atlanta (+14.9%) for third place. The Southeast (+17.9%) and South (+17.0%) were the strongest regions by far, with gains more than double those of the Northeast, Midwest, and West. The two weakest performers were San Francisco (up only +0.6% year-over-year) and Seattle (+4.5%). San Francisco and Seattle peaked in May 2022, and both have declined by more than -10% since then.""As the Federal Reserve continues to move interest rates higher, mortgage financing continues to be a headwind for home prices. Given the continuing prospects for a challenging macroeconomic environment, prices may well continue to weaken.""SUPPORTING DATATable 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrentIndexLevelDateLevelDateFrom Peak (%)LevelFrom Trough (%)From Peak (%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %298.99123.1 %62.0 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %303.86126.6 %47.1 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %315.13115.2 %39.3 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for September 2022.

Jewelry (-5.4%) and electronics (-5.3%) plunged from 2021 to 2022. Meanwhile, automotive sales are not included in the holiday sales data.Additionally, online spending grew 10.6% while in-store purchasing increased 6.8%. E-commerce comprised 21.6% of all retail sales, according to the data. This is up from 20.9% in 2021 and 20.6% in 2020.In a Mastercard press statement, senior advisor for Mastercard Steve Sadove said that spending was healthy, but that consumers approached the holiday season with a changed outlook this year.“This holiday retail season looked different than years past,” said Sadove. “Retailers discounted heavily, but consumers diversified their holiday spending to accommodate rising prices and an appetite for experiences and festive gatherings post-pandemic.”Inflation Relief: Where To Cut Corners on Insurance To Save in 2023As AP reported, inflation has decreased slowly over the past six months, yet consumer prices remain high. As a result, many more Americans shopped with purpose during the 2022 holiday period, by spending less on discretionary purchases and more on necessities, frequenting discount stores and big box chains and waiting for late-breaking deals at their favorite retailers.Story continuesMichelle Meyer, North America Chief Economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute, stated that, “Consumers and retailers navigated the season well, displaying resilience amid increasing economic pressures.” However, Meyer agreed that Americans have become deliberately shrewd shoppers during the 2022 holiday season.“Inflation altered the way U.S. consumers approached their holiday shopping — from hunting for the best deals to making trade-offs that stretched gift-giving budgets,” said Meyer.Per Mastercard, SpendingPulse assesses in-store and online U.S. retail sales, or “sales at retailers and food services merchants of all sizes,” across all forms of payment and is not adjusted for inflation.While it is a reliable indicator of consumer spending trends, AP stated next month’s National Retail Federation (NRF) report — combining November-December Commerce Department sales figures — should give a better understanding of how Americans spent their money this holiday season.Social Security: 2022’s COLA Was Behind Inflation By 50%, According to New StudyFind: The Best Month in 2023 To Buy FurnitureBack at the beginning of November, the NRF announced expected holiday retail growth of between 6%-8% during November and December YOY, totaling between $942.6 and $960.4 billion, and predicted that American consumers would remain resilient even during this frustrating stretch of high inflation and prices.“Despite record levels of inflation, rising interest rates and low levels of confidence, consumers have been steadfast in their spending and remain in the driver’s seat,” said NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz at the time.More From GOBankingRates6 Shakeups to Social Security Expected in the New YearGet Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 202310 Things to Do Now If Your Credit Score Is Under 700This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Holiday Retail Sales Exceeded Expectations in 2022 — How Inflation Influenced Shopping Behavior]"

Bitcoin has cratered over 65%. But gold? It’s up 1.3%. The classic inflation hedge has worked its magic in a wild year for investors, but it wasn’t the strong performance many goldbugs were expecting.The lack of impressive returns has mostly been the result of central banks worldwide hiking interest rates aggressively to fight inflation. Rising rates have increased the value of gold’s competition—the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries—leading prices to stagnate under $2,000 per troy ounce.“What should have been smooth sailing for gold became the perfect storm,” Mobeen Tahir, an investment strategist at WisdomTree, explained in a CNBC interview last week. “A rising U.S. dollar and rising Treasury yields became headwinds for gold.”But in recent weeks, with the strength of the U.S. dollar fading, gold prices have surged to a six-month high. And the precious metal got another boost from China’s decision to further ease its COVID-19 restrictions this week.Gold futures rose roughly 1% to $1,822 per troy ounce on Tuesday after trading as high as $1,838 in the morning hours.Analysts believe gold will see a demand boost as China, the world's largest single market for the metal, reopens. There are also a slew of potential tailwinds for gold heading into next year.If the Federal Reserve pauses or slows the pace of its rate hikes, treasury yields fall, or U.S. economic data deteriorates while inflation remains high, gold will outperform.“These are sort of Goldilocks conditions for gold. Perfect for conditions for gold,” Tahir said.But in the World Gold Council’s 2023 Gold Outlook, analysts said they expect a “a stable but positive performance for gold” next year amid competing headwinds and tailwinds.On one hand, mild recessions tend to bode well for gold, as do a weakening U.S. dollar and rising geopolitical tensions. On the other, inflation is set to fall in 2023, which may lead investors toward riskier assets.Story continues“Lower inflation should mean potentially diminished interest in gold from an inflation-hedging perspective,” the analysts wrote.Higher bond yields have also historically driven investors away from gold, but the World Gold Council’s analysts said they believe yields aren’t high enough to hurt prices significantly.“Although higher bond yields are associated with lower gold returns and might now be deemed attractive by some investors, current yield levels are historically not a hindrance to gold doing well, particularly when accounting for a weaker U.S. dollar,” they wrote.For investors, WisdomTree’s Tahir noted, it’s important to remember that “every gold rally has a silver lining.”“We may see a lot of investors express their bullish view on gold via silver next year,” he said, noting that the two precious metals often move in tandem, with silver commonly seeing better returns.Silver prices rose nearly 1.5% on Tuesday and are up roughly 15% over the past month.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches—living with mom and dadMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

Here to break it down is Futurum Research principal analyst Daniel Newman. Daniel, so we saw Micron claiming its inventories are now well above target levels. What exactly happened here with this chip glut?DANIEL NEWMAN: Well, just like we ended up in a shortage, nobody really expected so much demand to come on so quickly. And chipmakers weren't able to ramp up the inventory quickly enough. And so as that demand kind of swelled and stayed intact for more than a year following the initial pandemic, as people bought cars, gaming consoles, PC, servers in the data center, the same thing happened on the way down. We saw what happened with the Fed.We raised rates. We see we're heading into a recession. Discretionary income is down. People's balance sheets at home are not as good as they were. And all of a sudden, all these companies that ramped up have all this extra inventory. And effectively, we don't have the demand we had. And so now the inventory is there, and prices are coming down, and chipmakers are hurting.SEANA SMITH: And Daniel, we certainly have seen a number of chip makers respond and start to shift their operations or how they're approaching business over the coming quarters. Micron cutting 10% of its workforce as that demand drops. When it comes to these inventory levels, the fact that they are so swelled at this point, how long until those inventory levels, I guess, get to more appropriate or what is, I guess, considered a historic norm?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, we're hearing different things from different leaders in these companies. We've heard from Nvidia's leadership that it should be some time at the end of this quarter, which, for them, ends in January. We heard Sanjay Mehrotra of Micron say probably in the second half of this year. I think some of the specificity is going to go around, whether are they data center chips, are they automotive chips, are they gaming consoles, are they PCs.Story continuesEach of these have their own sort of boom and bust cycles, but of course, we're seeing sort of an overall bust cycle right now. I like the chip companies that are more centric to things like cloud data center and automotive. And those that are really heavily into gaming and PC, I think a lot of their demand got pulled forward. And you could see it a longer time. So that's why Mehrotra said second half of this year, Nvidia's gaming chips, parts of Intel and AMD, they're probably looking at second half or later before they really start to see normal demand come back.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Daniel, so I covered the auto sector. And we're still seeing a lot of the chip crunch happening there across a number of automakers. You mentioned that it's specific to different sectors. What is it about these chips that the auto sector needs is just-- is not-- the industry is not actually pumping out enough of them?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, it's really interesting. The automotive sector depends a lot on these lagging edge semiconductors, which is 14 nanometer and above. These are often produced by the likes of Tower Semiconductors, GlobalFoundries. A lot of what we're hearing, the resiliency, the fabs being built are more of these newer leading edge. These are the 5 and 7 nanometer process.So what's happened is we have all this demand peaking for automotive. You've got cars now that have more semiconductors in them than ever before, but we haven't really increased the production of capabilities like we're doing, and we haven't finished yet, but on a lot of these leading edge with the CHIPS Act. So we don't have the production capabilities to kind of get up to all this demand we had for automotive. And so we're still seeing car prices are still pretty high. Used car demand is still a little bit swelled. And all these chip makers are going to need to keep ramping up production to ever catch up on these automotive designs that are semiconductor intensive.SEANA SMITH: Daniel, we heard from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger back in October. And he said, quote, ""It's just hard to see any points of good news on the horizon."" We know that Intel then issued a muted outlook. They also announced job cuts. Do you see is there any reason to be optimistic about this sector heading into the new year?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, if you zoom out overall, it's really hard to see a world that isn't going to be accelerated by technology, whether that's supercomputing in AI. Whether that's the next generation of vehicles, data centers and the cloud, and the software that enterprises run to operate, all these things require semiconductors. Over the next 12 months, during a tight recessionary period, I believe companies are going to try to do more with what they have technology wise, which means less buying of PCs and servers, which means a tougher outlook in the short-term.But in the long run, the amount of software, the digitalization of everything means more semiconductors. You really got to follow those boom and bust cycles. We are in a bust cycle that was accelerated by a crazy boom. But the semiconductor tends to run pretty closely with those economic up and downs. I think as we start to come out of this economic downturn, you'll see the semiconductor volume pick up in a big way, as it's going to be critical to the advancement of our infrastructure and of business.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Daniel, so do you think that the CHIPS Act will kind of help that boom-bust, smooth it out a bit more? And who can really actually benefit in terms of the companies from that act?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, some of this demand planning, the supply chain issues that we have, the hyperdependency we've created with Taiwan, I mean, we definitely put ourselves in a bit of a difficult situation. We, of course, have great relations with Taiwan, but there's a lot of microaggression going on with China that's creating some discomfort. We've got some new tariffs and some new regulatory policy going against certain chips shipping over to China.We need to bring more production here to the United States. We need to bring more production on the leading edge. We need to bring more, as I mentioned with automotive, on some of those lagging, older process technologies, 14 nanometer and above. I think Intel has got the biggest opportunity to benefit. But we're seeing Micron, IBM. I mean, TSMC is reaching out for money. And all the fabless companies can benefit from some of the dollars that are there for innovation, R&amp;D, and design in the extension of the CHIPS and Sciences Act.But I like Intel's prospects. If they can get policymakers behind them, this could be a good moment for Intel. But of course, TSMC has had so much success. It'll be interesting to see does our government back the Taiwanese manufacturer to do more leading edge here, or does more dollars go to Intel, which may be a good idea for the national security and resiliency that we are needing in the future.SEANA SMITH: Certainly a number of stories to keep an eye on when it comes to the chip sector in 2020. Daniel Newman, as always, thanks so much for joining us here this afternoon.]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$12.6bUS$14.4bUS$13.2bUS$13.3bUS$13.7bUS$13.6bUS$13.7bUS$13.8bUS$13.9bUS$14.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.41%Est @ 0.31%Est @ 0.81%Est @ 1.16%Est @ 1.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.1% US$11.5kUS$12.1kUS$10.1kUS$9.4kUS$8.9kUS$8.1kUS$7.4kUS$6.9kUS$6.4kUS$5.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$87bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.1%– 2.0%) = US$203bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$203b÷ ( 1 + 9.1%)10= US$85bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$171b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$111, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at QUALCOMM as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.277. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for QUALCOMMStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For QUALCOMM, there are three pertinent elements you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with QUALCOMM (at least 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does QCOM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

152,8df69a4e-6295-3404-b92f-faca1205d814,LMT,2022-12-28,2022: Winners & Losers,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2022-winners-losers-221910742.html,1672179550,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'META', 'LMT']","[2022 marked a year of drastic change in global markets. Previous winners became losers, and losers morphed into some of the year’s biggest winners. The conflict in Russia intensified inflation and furthered an already fragile supply chain causing rocketing commodity prices. After years of dovish Federal Reserve policy, inflation finally reared its ugly head – soaring to near double-digit heights domestically and in many areas worldwide.The year was a distinct change of pace from the recent Covid-19 pandemic recovery. While it was difficult for some investors and rewarding to others, looking back, and learning from the past is a worthwhile endeavor. Though history may not repeat itself exactly, it tends to rhyme. Below are some of the biggest winners and losers of 2022:Winners:Value Stocks: In 2022, the Fed removed the proverbial “punch bowl” by raising rates at an unprecedented pace. As the economy slowed and the post-pandemic euphoria subsided, investors exited growth stocks and other “risk-on” areas and gravitated toward value. As of this writing, the Dow is down on the year; however, it is the top performing indices in the U.S. While the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 threaten recent lows, the Dow is above its 200-day moving average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Dow performance versus the Nasdaq.Consistency, profitability, and peace of mind were what investors were focused in on among an uncertain and frightening back-drop. Stocks like Coca-Cola KO were an oasis for investors looking for steady returns and a healthy dividend.Energy: Early in 2022, energy prices were trending higher as global economies recovered from the pandemic and demand rose drastically. Next, OPEC+ announced its largest oil production cut in history, stifling supply as demand grew. As the “perfect storm” began to form the final domino to fall over was the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Global superpowers such as the United States began to sanction Russia, cutting off one of the world’s largest oil suppliers. Natural Gas, Coal, and Solar Energy companies went on tremendous runs before pulling back in the past few months. The Energy Select Sector ETF XLE is up 56% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 Index is down 13% year-to-date.Story continuesDespite the massive gains earlier in the year, oil is again showing relative strength of late, as oil-related stocks like Haliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB breakout amidst general market weakness.Defense: Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the U.S. has sent more than $50 billion in military aid to the Ukrainian government – with more on the way. Defense stocks such as Lockheed Martin LMT and Northrup Grumman NOC have benefitted the most and have registered healthy gains for investors in a tough market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Defense names LMT and NOC have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 amidst the war in Ukraine.With Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky showing no signs of wanting to compromise or motivation to end the conflict, investors should be watching the space for 2023. Furthermore, both sides of the aisle in Washington seem firmly committed to spending more money to support Ukraine.Warren Buffett: The “Oracle of Ohama” had a signature year. While markets were volatile, and stocks with high valuations got crushed, Buffett outperformed. Rather than chasing the next shiny object, Buffett stuck his bread-and-butter strategy of investing in strong, reliable companies at reasonable valuations. Though Buffett’s largest position, Apple AAPL, fell in tandem with most tech-related stocks, he succeeded by taking a massive position in oil-related stock Occidental Petroleum (OXY). Meanwhile, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRKA is just 15% off its all-time highs.Losers: Growth Stocks: Higher interest rates, inflation, slower growth, and lofty valuations are a recipe for disaster for growth-related stocks. Former high-flyers like Shopify SHOP and Fastly FSLY saw selling for most of the year as investors opted for safer bets. After being the top performing area of the market post-pandemic, 2022 marked the end of the euphoria.Crypto: “It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.” A down economy and a risk-off environment exposed crypto in 2022. Not only was the crypto space already moving down, bankruptcy and fraud also led to it spiraling out of control.The bankruptcy of the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) started the snowballing effect, culminating in several crypto frauds being exposed. Next, Celsius, a crypto lender, became the focus of regulators, leading to bankruptcy and the infamous downfall of the Luna coin collapse. Lastly and most prominently is the collapse of one of the largest brokers – FTX. FTX is said to have mishandled (lost) more than $10 billion in client capital. CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is now in custody in the United States. Public companies such as crypto exchange Coinbase COIN and miner Marathon Digital (MARA) suffered from the fallout – dropping by more than 85%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Public crypto firms have fallen in tandem with the industry as a whole.Meta Platforms META: Meta, formerly known as Facebook, was responsible for losses of more than half a trillion dollars in value in 2022. After the social media juggernaut eclipsed a mind-blowing value of $1 trillion early in the year, visionary CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to steer the company’s focus to the metaverse and research and development. After a lackluster earnings report, Zuckerberg doubled down on the strategy, and investors punished the stock accordingly. While its not clear how Zuckerberg’s bet will play out in the long term, META was amongst the biggest losers in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Meta's steep 2022 losses.Cathie Wood: Cathie Wood, manager of the Ark Innovation ETF ARKK, came to prominence after being invested in some of the most high-octane growth stocks. As Covid-19 fears subsided, many stocks such as Teladoc (TDOC) and Zoom ZM saw their valuations jump years ahead of their growth trajectories as adoption rose due to the pandemic. However, in 2022, reality struck, and valuations of some of the active ETF’s biggest holdings, like Tesla TSLA, came back to earth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: One of Arkk's largest holdings TSLA is down big in 2022.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $1.05 billion, the contract is expected to get completed by January 2024. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure long lead time materials, parts, components and efforts necessary to maintain on-time production and delivery of 118 F-35 jets from the 18th lot.The deal will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) participants and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. The majority of work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed Martin enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. Moreover, LMT’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft with advanced technologies and enhance its capabilities to meet current warfare needs boost demand significantly.The F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for its Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 68% of Aeronautics’ net sales in 2021.Lockheed Martin delivered 841 F-35 airplanes from the program's inception with 271 jets in backlog till September 2022. This, along with the latest contract win, boosts sales expectations for the Aeronautics business segment.Lockheed expects to make deliveries of this stealth aircraft in the range of 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 in 2025 and beyond. This, in turn, should bolster LMT’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft arena.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to further reap the benefits of military aircraft market expansion. Other prominent defense majors that are involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT, which are also expected to benefit from the aforementioned market growth projection.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) shareholders have enjoyed a 52% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 38% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 40% , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Lockheed Martin managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 9% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Lockheed Martin's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Lockheed Martin the TSR over the last 5 years was 73%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Lockheed Martin shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 40% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 12%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin  that you should be aware of.Lockheed Martin is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on PulteGroup's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for PulteGroup How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PulteGroup is:29% = US$2.4b ÷ US$8.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.29 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of PulteGroup's Earnings Growth And 29% ROEFirst thing first, we like that PulteGroup has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 23% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 28% net income growth seen by PulteGroup over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between PulteGroup's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 30% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PHM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is PulteGroup Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?PulteGroup's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 8.9% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (91%) of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Moreover, PulteGroup is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of nine years of paying a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 8.7%. Regardless, PulteGroup's ROE is speculated to decline to 16% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with PulteGroup's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 largest healthcare companies by market cap.Competition should always be encouraged in the business world. After all, competition breeds innovation and innovation results in better advancements that improve the quality of our lives. The improvement in standard of living in just the past few decades is incredible and versus the previous century, it is almost unthinkable how far humanity has progressed.However, it is a debatable topic that some industries should be regulated more by the governments and shouldn't be for profit. One of these industries is the healthcare industry, where literally the lives of people are on the line. In most of the developed countries in the world, healthcare is regulated by the government, with socialized healthcare available to its citizens and residents. In fact, the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where the healthcare industry is for-profit, which is why 11 of the 15 largest healthcare companies by market cap are located in the U.S.15 largest healthcare companies by market capPhoto by CDC on UnsplashOn one hand, allowing the healthcare industry to remain for-profit allows for greater competition and innovation, as companies are highly motivated to invest in and develop new solutions to problems. Many of the advancements made in the healthcare industry come from the U.S. which is also the most technologically advanced country in the world precisely because of the high level of competition and freedom allowed to companies operating within the country, as compared to Western Europe, where focus is higher on consumer rights and companies have to comply with strict regulations that can stifle innovation, and be detrimental to consumers as companies do not have the same level of freedom to operate and developed new technologies. On the other hand, allowing companies freehand to do as they please is a recipe for disaster as well, as profits need to be balanced with the benefit to the general population. This is one place where the U.S. has struggled, with healthcare companies often raising prices significantly enough that if you don't have private insurance, even a normal routine procedure can result in your life savings being drained at a moment's notice.Story continuesThe global healthcare industry, according to The Business Research Company, was worth $6.8 trillion in 2021 and was expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% to reach $7.5 trillion in 2022, which shows that there is a lot of potential for growth in the industry and identifying the companies leading this growth is important in making the best possible investment decisions. Innovation is the driver of success and according to fDi Intelligence, the healthcare industry is among the most innovative industries in the world. Many of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world are among the biggest R&amp;D spenders in the world, while from our list of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap, Siemens Healthineers is one of the highest spenders on R&amp;D, with 2020 expenses exceeding $1.5 billion, which was 9% of the company's total revenue.In the U.S., since universal healthcare does not exist, even a simple procedure can cost tens of thousands of dollars, which in a country where the federal minimum wage is $7.5 an hour, can easily bankrupt someone who doesn't have private insurance. And people who are on the low end of the totem pole in the corporate world or unemployed are more likely not to have insurance. The reason prices are so exorbitant is that insurance companies then haggle with hospitals or healthcare providers to reduce the charges, and a common price is agreed. While this is great news for healthcare companies, and this is why many of them earn hundreds of millions of dollars in profits if not billions, it is not as good for the actual patients, who have the added stress and tension of trying to pay off a bill with savings that they don't have.The presence of technology is ever-increasing in the healthcare industry, and if you're considering which companies have the highest potential for growth, just take a look at the companies increasingly adapting cutting-edge technology to provide innovative solutions in the industry. According to Forbes, the rate of technology adoptions in the healthcare industry increased significantly during the pandemic. More and more hospitals are implementing technological solutions. What seems run of the mill now was once groundbreaking technology, including IV pumps, patient monitors, ventilators and more. Correct implementation of technology will increase efficiency, which in turn means that the benefits of current resources will be maximized and hence, the bottom line will improve. It will be interesting to see in a few years which of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap utilize technology correctly to increase market share and their grip on an extremely profitable industry (see 10 best healthcare dividend stocks to buy).The healthcare segment has various divisions, which includes health insurance, pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare services providers and medical equipment among others. We excluded pharmaceutical companies from our ranking as they would absolutely dominate the list otherwise and claim four out of the top five positions.

RSG is benefiting from its solid operating performance and investor-friendly steps.RSG’s earnings and revenues for 2022 are expected to improve 16% and 19%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures. Factors That Augur WellThe company is focused on increasing its operational excellence by shifting to compressed natural gas (CNG) collection vehicles and converting rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders. This, in turn, will reduce cost and improve profitability of RSG.RSG is focusing on enhancing its operations by streamlining the cost structure, improving the revenue quality and seeking growth through profitable investment opportunities. In 2021, almost 13% of the replacement vehicle purchases were CNG vehicles.Republic Services is highly optimistic about the use of CNG vehicles. This will help it compete effectively on the grounds of maintaining a clean environment. As of Dec 31, 2021, Republic Services operated 40 CNG fuelling stations.We are also impressed with the company’s consistent efforts in rewarding its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, RSG paid out $552.6 million, $522.5 million and $491.2 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $252.2 million, $98.8 million and $399.4 million, respectively.Such moves indicate a company’s commitment to create value for its shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These initiatives buoy investors’ optimism on the stock and positively impact earnings per share.Key RiskRepublic Services' liquidity position is concerning. RSG’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of third-quarter 2022 was 0.70, lower than its prior quarter's figure of 0.73. Decreasing current ratio is not a favorable development. Moreover, a current ratio of less than 1 is not desirable as it implies a company's insufficiency of liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities.Story continuesZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderRepublic Services currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +4.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 4.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share, indicating a change of -14.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.38 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.71 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.16 billion and $58.22 billion estimates indicate +18% and -1.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.43%. The EPS surprise was +10.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Farmland and Agriculture Stocks to Buy. Kenneth Scott Zuckerberg, lead analyst and senior economist with CoBank's Knowledge Exchange division, told S&amp;P Global Commodities Insights in an interview in August 2022 that farmers and customers around the world may have to face a turbulent market well into 2023 given the upside risks to the prices of agricultural commodities and inputs. Prices of primary crops like corn, soybean, and wheat have been accelerating due to the Russia-Ukraine war, weather constraints, and supply chain bottlenecks. According to Zuckerberg, the Russia-Ukraine war will impact the supply of grain and oilseeds for three or more years as Ukraine is one of the world's largest producers of corn, wheat, and sunflower oil, and the war has tightened the supply of these commodities meaningfully.High energy costs have also made the production of fertilizers costly. Lately, fertilizer prices have normalized relatively. Yet, the likelihood of natural gas supply challenges in the European Union from Russia can result in a steep increase in gas prices and costs of fertilizers. Zuckerberg further noted: ""If they [Russia] pull supply, natural gas prices go up ... it means fertilizer prices go up, and we have a restart to the inflation regardless of what the central banks are doing on interest rates."" Given that China is one of the biggest producers, consumers, and importers of food and grains in the world, Zuckerberg explained that:""I think we can't ignore the China-Taiwan situation because once somebody tells you their intention, it is really important to remember that.""Farmland and agriculture stocks are likely to continue to boom given the uncertainties in the sector will not tamper with the global demand for agricultural inputs and commodities. Investors usually prefer to invest in farmland and agriculture stocks because of their diversification and inflation hedge characteristics. Billionaire Bill Gates is the #1 private farmland owner in the United States. Some of the best agriculture stocks to invest in include The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) according to hedge funds. Gladstone Land Corporation (LAND) is a pure play farmland stock that owns and acquires farm-related properties in the US, however, it failed to make our list because there were only 8 hedge funds with bullish positions in the stock. Farmland Partners Inc (FPI) is also a pure play farmland stock that follows a similar business model, however, Farmland Partners Inc also failed to make our list for the same reason. Story continuesOur Methodology We selected the following agriculture stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 11 Best Farmland and Agriculture Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023Kingarion/Shutterstock.comBest Farmland and Agriculture Stocks To Buy Heading Into 202311. Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) was incorporated in 2012 and is headquartered in Saint Louis, Missouri. It operates as a food technology company that unlocks natural genetic diversity of plants. The company has two segments, Ingredients and Fresh. On November 10, Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) reported a Q3 GAAP loss per share of $0.16 and a revenue of $130.18 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.05 and $45.33 million, respectively. Revenue over the period climbed nearly 307% from the prior-year quarter. On September 30, UBS analyst Cody Ross initiated coverage of Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) with a Buy rating and a $5.00 price target. The company is on the brink of transforming its business model into a ""proprietary/partnership, high margin, asset-light model"", which should contribute 69% of the sales mix by 2025, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) was part of 16 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 17 funds in the last quarter. Like The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), Benson Hill, Inc. (NYSE:BHIL) is one of the best agriculture stocks to monitor. 10. ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL) is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel, and it operates as a specialty minerals and chemicals company worldwide. The company has four segments – Industrial Products, Potash, Phosphate Solutions, and Innovative Ag Solutions. It is one of the best agriculture stocks to invest in. In Q3 2022, ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL) reported adjusted EBITDA of $1,049 million, up 139% versus $438 million in the last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 41.6%, up from 24.5% in the prior quarter. On November 17, Barclays analyst Benjamin Theurer maintained an Equal Weight rating on ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL) and lowered the price target on the shares to $11 from $12 after the earnings season. While the analyst remains positive about the broader agriculture space, he believes fiscal 2023 will in part be a year of relatively more normal earnings levels, with results beating performance prior to sanctions against Belarus being introduced and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 17 hedge funds were bullish on ICL Group Ltd (NYSE:ICL), compared to 13 funds in the prior quarter. 9. FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Next on our list of the best agriculture stocks is FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC), a Pennsylvania-based agricultural sciences company that provides crop protection, plant health, and professional pest and turf management products. On December 14, FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) declared a $0.58 per share quarterly dividend, a 9.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.53. The dividend is payable on January 19, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 30. On November 15, Loop Capital analyst Christopher Kapsch upgraded FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $149, up from $132. The earlier downgrade was due to his belief that the stock's valuation had gotten ahead of the story, but FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) has executed well, which helped derisk its earnings progression, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 28 hedge funds were long FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) with collective stakes worth $496.5 million, compared to 29 funds in the last quarter worth $361.2 million. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group held the biggest stake in the company, consisting of 1.2 million shares worth $130 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“FMC is an agricultural sciences company providing solutions for the protection of crops from different pests. Its products are used by farmers to ensure bugs, weeds and fungi do not negatively impact their harvest. Headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the company has a rich history dating back to 1883 when inventor John Bean set out to build a better insecticide spray pump. Over the decades, through acquisitions, FMC became a disparate collection of chemical companies. FMC has transformed itself to solely focus on crop chemicals, having acquired DuPont’s crop chemicals portfolio in 2017, and completed the separation of its lithium business in 2019. FMC is now one of the largest patented crop protection companies globally.Its presence is balanced both geographically around the world, as well as from a crop exposure standpoint, with soybeans being the largest at roughly 20% of total revenue. In terms of products, FMC’s portfolio skews toward insecticides, which account for over 60% of its revenue. The remainder are herbicides (~25%), as well as fungicides and other crop chemicals (~15%).High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for FMC include:Attractive ValuationWe believe FMC’s current stock price is offered at a discount to our determination of the company’s intrinsic value given our estimates of both enhanced margins and higher earnings on a normalized basis.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for FMC, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:FMC is poised to benefit from its focus on crop chemicals, as yield gains are needed to support rising food consumption in emerging markets;Continued margin improvements from its product pipeline. These new products should be particularly effective against insects, weeds and fungi that have grown resistant to traditional crop chemicals; andFurther cross-selling of FMC products to DuPont customers. For example, in Argentina, 78% of the customers it gained from the DuPont acquisition were unique to FMC, providing cross-selling opportunities.”8. CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) is one of the top agriculture stocks to monitor. The London-based company designs, manufactures, commercializes, and finances agricultural and construction equipment, trucks, commercial vehicles, buses, and specialty vehicles in North America, Europe, South America, and internationally.

(NYSE:CNHI) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 25 funds in the last quarter.

(NYSE:CNHI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We sold our position in Iveco Group (Italy), in favor of names that, in our opinion, offer a more favorable risk/return profile. Iveco Group’s arrival in the Fund stemmed from CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)’s demerger of its trucks and commercial vehicles business in early January. We continue to hold CNH Industrial as we believe it holds an attractive valuation at its current price.”7. The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) provides lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, weed, pest, and disease control products, mulch, and water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods.

The NTSB is involved as Boeing is a U.S. company.Fight 302 crashed shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa in March 2019, killing all 157 people on board.Ethiopia's Aircraft Investigation Bureau released its long-delayed report last Friday. It blamed the accident on ""uncommanded"" inputs from Boeing's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System, known as MCAS.The inputs, which were caused by faulty data from an underlying sensor, sent the plane's nose down repeatedly, leading to loss of control as the pilots tried to deal with several warnings in the cabin, the report said.But in its comments, the NTSB said it found the faulty sensor may have been damaged by a bird strike soon after take-off, an assertion that was ignored by the Ethiopian investigators.The Ethiopians did not find any evidence that the sensor was damaged in flight due to lack of any physical clues like a dead bird in the vicinity of the flight's path, their report said.The NTSB, however, said the sensor was never recovered at the crash site in spite of a partial search by both sides a week after the accident.Boeing has previously said the MCAS was a safety feature and the issues identified after the crash of flight 302, which followed one of a similar plane in Indonesia five months earlier, have been rectified.The NTSB also accused their Ethiopian counterparts of focusing on the contributions of the design issues to the accident at the expense of the crew's own training and reaction to the emergency that arose.Story continues""Discussion of crew resource management and performance were still not sufficiently developed in the draft final report,"" the NTSB said.The pilots were supposed to manually reduce throttle after the erroneous feeds from the sensor interfered with the expected automatic sequence, it said.In their report, the Ethiopian investigators found that the crew members were licensed and qualified for flight in accordance with the existing Ethiopian Civil Aviation Rules and Standards, but were startled by the unprecedented change of events and ""confusing alerts"", and blamed it all on the plane's design.""Flight crew situational awareness and ability to perceive each and every thing to the detail was greatly affected with the ever changing flight scenario and unsettling warnings and flight deck effects,"" the report said.The investigation bureau referred Reuters to NTSB's statement when asked for further comments.The accident involving Flight 302 followed another incident five months earlier, when the same model crashed in Indonesia, killing 189 people.The accidents exposed a problem with a system on the plane, and the model was grounded worldwide, costing Boeing some $20 billion and prompting court cases that exposed shortcomings with the certification process.Operators have since resumed flying the 737-MAX after the plane's 20-month grounding. Ethiopia was among the last countries to return the 737 MAX to service.

According to a December survey of 38 economists per Bloomberg, there's a 70% probability the U.S. economy will enter into a recession in 2023.As a result of the expected economic slowdown next year, there is a higher likelihood of lower than expected earnings for the broader market in 2023.Because the market is future looking, broader market valuations have already decreased substantially in 2022. As of the indexes year to date as of December 26, the S&amp;P 500 is down 19.84% and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 33.70%. Even the blue chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated 9.24% in 2022.Many stocks do not do well if company earnings significantly underperform and outlook dissapoints. If earnings and outlook misses substantially, many analysts also lower their future estimated earnings, which can potentially lower valuations further in some instances.Blue Chip CompaniesBlue chips are companies who have substantial competitive advantages that often also have a strong financial history of profitability. Many blue chips have a long history of returning capital back to shareholders via dividends or stock repurchases.While blue chips as a whole have done better than the broader market, some blue chips have not done as well for various reasons.Some blue chips in the tech sector have underperformed because the higher inflation has put pressure on the ad market which has led to slower growth. Many big tech blue chips have also seen their valuations decline given capital has moved from tech to U.S. government bonds considering the rising interest rates.Story continuesIf economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside in the near term. For the quality blue chip companies that grow their earnings, however, there's upside in the long term. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy That Are Down Over 30% YTD, we picked 12 stocks that have competitive advantages that are down over 30% year to date according to FINVIZ.com as of December 26.We ranked the 12 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, also check out 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.12 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy That Are Down Over 30% YTD12. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Year to Date Performance as of 12/26: -32.37%3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a blue chip specialty industrial machinery conglomerate whose shares have declined 32.37% year to date.

(NYSE:TEL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 3rd of March to $0.56. This will take the annual payment to 2.0% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, TE Connectivity's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 15.7%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.72 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.24. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. TE Connectivity has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 12% per annum. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.TE Connectivity Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

According to a December survey of 38 economists per Bloomberg, there's a 70% probability the U.S. economy will enter into a recession in 2023.As a result of the expected economic slowdown next year, there is a higher likelihood of lower than expected earnings for the broader market in 2023.Because the market is future looking, broader market valuations have already decreased substantially in 2022. As of the indexes year to date as of December 26, the S&amp;P 500 is down 19.84% and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 33.70%. Even the blue chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated 9.24% in 2022.Many stocks do not do well if company earnings significantly underperform and outlook dissapoints. If earnings and outlook misses substantially, many analysts also lower their future estimated earnings, which can potentially lower valuations further in some instances.Blue Chip CompaniesBlue chips are companies who have substantial competitive advantages that often also have a strong financial history of profitability. Many blue chips have a long history of returning capital back to shareholders via dividends or stock repurchases.While blue chips as a whole have done better than the broader market, some blue chips have not done as well for various reasons.Some blue chips in the tech sector have underperformed because the higher inflation has put pressure on the ad market which has led to slower growth. Many big tech blue chips have also seen their valuations decline given capital has moved from tech to U.S. government bonds considering the rising interest rates.Story continuesIf economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside in the near term. For the quality blue chip companies that grow their earnings, however, there's upside in the long term.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nike (NKE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Nike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.3% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NKEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NKECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nike here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Nike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NKE a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.7% over the past month to $3.11.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nike may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These traits have been the key burdens on the participating companies' profits. Additionally, adverse currency movements threaten the industry players due to their worldwide presence.However, the industry players are well-poised to benefit from the favorable health and wellness trends, which have been boosting the demand for activewear and athletic shoes. The new and innovative designs, along with increased consumer awareness about leading a healthy lifestyle, will likely continue aiding sales of fitness clothes and footwear. The industry players, focused on product innovation, store expansion, digital investments and omni-channel growth, are expected to gain.The industry participants have been investing in product innovation to gain market share. Investments in products and e-commerce portals bode well for players like NIKE Inc., Deckers Outdoor, Skechers and Caleres.About the IndustryThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry comprises companies that design, source and market clothing, footwear and accessories for men, women and children under various brand names. Product offerings of the companies mostly include athletic and casual footwear, fashion apparel and activewear, sports equipment, bags, balls, and other sports and fashion accessories.The companies showcase their products through their branded outlets and websites. Some companies distribute products via other retail stores such as national chains, online retailers, sporting goods stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.Story continuesA Look at What's Shaping Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry's FutureCost Headwinds: Companies in the industry are witnessing elevated costs due to factors like commodity cost inflation, increased freight costs, reinvestments and other impacts. Supply-chain constraints, extended transit times, and elevated ocean freight and logistic costs have been acting as deterrents. A number of companies expect increased freight and logistic costs to hurt margins in the near term.Elevated marketing expenses, higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses, and increased investments to enhance store and digital operations have been raising SG&amp;A costs. Also, the industry participants are witnessing higher costs to support brand campaigns and digital investments.The exit from the Russia business due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict and COVID-related disruptions in some parts of Greater China are likely to be the key concerns for some players. A tough and competitive labor market remains another concern. These factors pose a threat to the industry players' margins.Consumer Demand Trends: Players in the industry have been benefiting from strong consumer demand for activewear/athleisure products and footwear, which is expected to persist in 2023. Athletic goods and apparel companies offer products from footwear, sweatshirts, leggings, pants, jackets and tops to yoga wear and running clothes for men and women. The increasing fashion sense is boosting the demand for innovative clothes and footwear in the United States.The industry participants have been focused on product innovations, active promotions, store expansion and enhancing e-commerce capabilities to gain market share. Favorable health &amp; wellness trends have been the key to inspiring footwear manufacturers to expand their product portfolio. The companies continue to innovate styles, materials and colors, and incorporate functional designs to grab a large share of the fast-growing market.Moreover, multi-functional shoes that cater to casual and formal looks have been gaining popularity. The increased participation of women in sports and outdoor activities in recent years has been a boon for the industry players.E-Commerce Investments: E-commerce has been playing a crucial role in the athleisure market's growth. The companies in the segment are looking to build a customer base through websites, social media and other digital channels. As consumers continue to shop from home, growth of athletic-inspired apparel and digital sales are likely to continue.Companies focused on expanding their athletic-based apparel lines and building on e-commerce capabilities are expected to witness growth in the long run. Efforts to accelerate deliveries through investments in supply chains and order fulfillment avenues are likely to provide an edge to the industry players.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts, as well as mobile point-of-sale capabilities, to make stores attractive. The efforts to enhance experiences through multiple channels are likely to contribute significantly to improving traffic and transactions both in stores and online.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is an 11-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #214, which places it in the bottom 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects for the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry's earnings estimates for 2022 and 2023 have declined 21.7% and 28.8%, respectively.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry vs. SectorThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry has outperformed its sector but underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the past year.While stocks in the industry have collectively declined 28.1%, the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has dropped 19.5%.

(NKE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-trending-stock-140002790.html,1672063202,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +9.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has gained 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.54 per share, indicating a change of -37.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -18.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -17.1%. This estimate has changed +4.7% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.89 indicates a change of +25% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.7%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $49.9 billion and $53.79 billion estimates indicate +6.8% and +7.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $13.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.2%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $0.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.62%. The EPS surprise was +30.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

187,95268fec-db7e-3c68-b1d5-c0d36adcd260,NKE,2022-12-28,"Positive week for NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) institutional investors who lost 30% over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-nike-inc-nyse-130029681.html,1672059629,STORY,['NKE'],"[A look at the shareholders of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 68% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 30% losses, last week’s 13% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NIKE, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for NIKE ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NIKE?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that NIKE does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NIKE's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NIKE. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Philip Knight (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 17% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.9% and 5.7% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of NIKEWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in NIKE, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$182b, and insiders have US$36b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NIKE. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NIKE better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

188,9cdde606-de96-3353-a11d-0c26de414c78,WFC,2022-12-28,Column: Wells Fargo got slammed with a $3.7-billion penalty. So why doesn't it sound sorry?,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-wells-fargo-got-slammed-130028445.html,1672232428,STORY,"['WFC-PD', 'JPM']","[Then-Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf testifying before Congress in 2016 about the bank's opening of millions of improper customer accounts. He stepped down, but the bank still struggles to recover its reputation. (Cliff Owen / Associated Press)The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau left very little unsaid when it announced, a few days before Christmas, $3.7 billion in assessments against Wells Fargo Bank for more than a decade of legal violations harming its millions of customers.The total included a $1.7-billion civil penalty, the largest imposed by the CFPB in its 11-year history, and an additional $2 billion in redress and restitution for cheated customers.""Put simply, Wells Fargo is a corporate recidivist that puts one-third of American households at risk of harm,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said, calling the giant bank ""one of the most problematic repeat offenders"" in its jurisdiction.One might think that a financial institution so soundly spanked would respond to the punishment with humility and candor. Sadly, no. This is Wells Fargo we're talking about, so in its own news release it described the CFPB's order as an ""agreement ... to resolve multiple issues.""The release didn't even mention the $2 billion in redress and restitution to customers. It highlighted that the CFPB, in its Dec. 20 order, ""recognized"" that the bank had ""accelerated corrective actions and remediation"" since 2020, implying that the bureau was well pleased with the results.Put simply, Wells Fargo is a corporate recidivist that puts one third of American households at risk of harm.CFPB Director Rohit ChopraIn fact, however, Chopra said in his prepared remarks that the bank is ""not making rapid progress"" in fixing its long-standing problems. Indeed, its recent ""product launches, growth initiatives, and other efforts to increase profits"" may even have ""delayed needed reform.""Of course, one doesn't expect PR departments to ballyhoo bad news. But it's still rare to see such a masterpiece of corporate-speak as the Wells Fargo statement crossing one's desk.The bank implied that the CFPB's order merely cleans up some old business ""related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending,"" without going into specifics about what it was accused of, beyond mentioning ""a series of unacceptable practices."" For that, one would have to refer to the CFPB's 32-page consent order itself, which offers considerable detail.Story continuesBefore reviewing the bank's discreditable record, let's examine the regulatory system that has allowed it to get to this point.The fundamental problem is the tendency of U.S. business regulators to go easy on big companies caught violating the law. The bigger and more important the company, the more indulgent its government overseers.In the banking sector, a prime example is JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which has compiled a truly impressive history of corruption and fraud even while operating under supposedly heightened regulatory scrutiny.In 2020, the company got disciplined for a serious, flagrant, years-long plot to rig financial markets through thousands of episodes of unlawful trading in precious metals futures contracts and in U.S. Treasury futures.Dan M. Berkovitz, then a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, called “the scope of misconduct and market harm ... unparalleled.”The government hit JPMorgan with a record $920 million in fines and penalties. Yet the market watchdog organization Better Markets rightly termed the outcome a “sweetheart deal.”That's because the accusation of market-rigging was the third JPMorgan had faced in recent years, including a bid-rigging scheme in the California electricity market in 2010 and 2011 for which the bank paid a $410-million penalty.JPMorgan was already under a sentence of probation imposed in May 2015 for manipulating the foreign exchange market, to which the bank pleaded guilty to a conspiracy count. In that deal, the bank was forbidden to “commit another crime in violation of the federal laws of the United States.”Yet the offenses at the heart of the 2020 enforcement case dated from at least 2008 and continued until at least January 2016, prosecutors said. That means the alleged market rigging was taking place place while the earlier settlement was being negotiated and continued for seven months after the bank promised not to break the law again.In that 2015 settlement, JPMorgan pleaded guilty to a criminal count of conspiracy and agreed to pay $550 million in fines. Four other banks — Citicorp, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS — also pleaded guilty and agreed to pay a combined $2 billion in fines.Prosecutors pledged that there would be no second chances for these offenders. ""We will hold financial institutions accountable for criminal misconduct,” one of the prosecutors said.Instead, despite a new charge of “unparalleled” wrongdoing, JPMorgan's penalty was just rolled over to another three years’ probation.The instruments that regulators and prosecutors use to extract a few bucks from corporate wrongdoers without really punishing them fall into two categories: deferred prosecution agreements, or DPAs, and consent orders.The first are settlements in which the government holds back from bringing a criminal case as long as the target promises not to commit the same crime or another within a specified period. The second are deals in which a company consents to paying a penalty and taking other compliance steps — repaying cheated customers, upgrading its internal anti-fraud compliance and so on — without admitting or denying the regulators' allegations.The deferred prosecution game was exploited to great effect by JPMorgan. In 2014, the bank secured a deferred prosecution agreement related to its alleged failure to alert authorities to what it knew about the Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff, a Morgan client.Yet the conduct charged in 2020 dated from the period covered by the agreement, so that prosecution should have been reinstated. Obviously, unless prosecutors follow through on their promise to enforce the DPA, it's worthless. As Better Markets put it, an unenforced DPA is nothing but ""a farce and a fraud on the public.""As for consent orders, Wells Fargo has piled those up the way a forest deer collects ticks. From a corporation's standpoint, consent orders are terrific because corporations are almost always allowed to sign them without ""admitting or denying"" the regulators' findings of fact or conclusions of law.From time to time, a regulator will call foul on recidivist corporate wrongdoers. In 2015, then-commissioner Kara M. Stein of the Securities and Exchange Commission dissented from a wrist-slap issued by the SEC to JPMorgan and four other banks that had pleaded guilty to the crime of manipulating the foreign exchange market.The SEC granted the five banks waivers from rules requiring that they be disqualified from certain privileges as market participants. As Stein observed, that was the sixth such waiver granted Morgan in seven years; all told, the five banks had received more than 23 such waivers over the previous nine years.""This type of recidivism and repeated criminal misconduct should lead to revocations of prior waivers, not the granting of a whole new set of waivers,"" Stein complained. ""We have the tools ... yet we refuse to use them.""She was right. If regulators repeatedly let corporate wrongdoers off the hook, nothing will stop them from repeatedly breaking the law in the knowledge that they'll just be granted another waiver from the consequences.In its latest news release, Wells Fargo congratulated itself for securing the termination or expiration of four earlier consent orders reached with the CFPB and the comptroller of the currency. In none of them did the bank admit or deny the allegations, though it did pay millions of dollars in penalties.Nor does that scratch the surface. By my count, Wells Fargo has collected at least 14 consent orders from the CFPB, the comptroller and the Federal Reserve since 2011, of which 10 may still be in effect.On one occasion, the bank had to stand up in federal court (so to speak) and admit its criminal activity forthrightly. That was in 2020, when Wells Fargo admitted to collecting millions of dollars in improper fees and interest, harming the credit ratings of some customers, and misusing customers' personal information to open accounts without their knowledge. The bank paid a $3-billion penalty and in return received — wouldn't you know it — a deferred prosecution agreement.Let's now be reminded of what this bank has been up to. The emblematic case is the account-opening scam first uncovered by my former Times colleague E. Scott Reckard in 2013, in which Wells Fargo bankers opened as many as 2 million fake accounts in the names of existing retail customers or nonexistent persons in efforts to meet unrelenting sales pressure imposed from above.The bank said it fired 5,300 mostly rank-and-file employees for this behavior, but plainly it resulted from an unforgiving and unrealistic corporate culture.The CFPB's Dec. 20 penalty covers the bank's record of incorrectly applying borrowers’ payments on auto loans, resulting in improper charges of fees and interest and in some cases improper repossession of borrowers' cars. Of the $2 billion in restitution, a total of more than $1.4 billion is due to 11 million of those borrowers. Most of that has already been paid out.There were multiple problems in home mortgage servicing, including improper denials of loan modification applications and miscalculations of fees and other errors that resulted in foreclosures in as many as 3,200 cases. The bank is ordered to make about $275 million in recompense to affected mortgage customers.The bank had a flawed system for dealing with account deposits it deemed ""suspect"" — freezing not only the suspect deposits but also the customers' entire account and any other accounts they held. That prevented the customers from accessing their money for as long as two weeks. Wells Fargo also charged improper monthly fees and overdraft charges to some customers. The bank will be returning about $300 million to at least 4 million affected customers.Is that all? The CFPB isn't convinced that Wells Fargo has got its house in order. The bank is now on its third chief executive since 2016, when John G. Stumpf, who had served in that capacity since 2007, stepped down in the wake of the account-opening disclosures.Wells Fargo has been trying to restore its reputation ever since, but it has suffered a few missteps. In 2018, for instance, it tried to defend itself against a shareholder lawsuit by asserting that corporate statements that it was working to “restore trust” were merely ""corporate puffery ... on which no reasonable investor could rely.”CFPB officials say that Wells Fargo is not the only bank to mistreat customers in these ways, but it seems to land on regulators' dockets disturbingly often. The bank is still asserting that, as it said in its Dec. 20 news release, it ""has made a series of changes to transform the way it operates."" We'll see if that's finally, the real thing, or just more puffery.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoThe insider, Kleber Santos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$40.98. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Wells Fargo insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$91m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Wells Fargo insiders. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort.

(NYSE:PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review a Biologics License Application (BLA) for its investigational pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate (MenABCWY). Pfizer submitted MenABCWY for the prevention of meningococcal disease caused by the most common serogroups in individuals 10 through 25 years of age.The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA on the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine application is in October 2023.Pfizer’s MenABCWY vaccine candidate combines the components of two vaccines into one, helping protect against the meningococcal serogroups that cause the majority of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) globally.1 In the U.S., approximately 55 million adolescents and young adults are in the age range for meningococcal vaccination (11-23 years old), according to ACIP recommendations.2""The FDA’s acceptance of our application for the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate is an essential step toward helping protect individuals and communities against the most common types of meningococcal disease,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. ""We believe our investigational MenABCWY vaccine, if approved and recommended, could help simplify the meningococcal vaccination schedule for adolescents and young adults, and in turn improve vaccination rates, and provide the broadest serogroup coverage of any meningococcal vaccine. The pentavalent vaccine candidate was well-tolerated in clinical trials, with a safety profile consistent with currently licensed meningococcal vaccines.""The regulatory submission is supported by previously announced positive results from a randomized, active-controlled and observer-blinded Phase 3 trial assessing the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the pentavalent vaccine candidate compared to currently licensed meningococcal vaccines, with the goal of determining immunologic noninferiority. The Phase 3 trial (NCT04440163) evaluated more than 2,400 patients from the U.S. and Europe.Story continuesPotential U.S. Public Health Impact of a MenABCWY VaccineMeningococcal disease is an uncommon but serious illness that can lead to death within 24 hours and, for survivors, can result in life-altering, significant long-term disabilities.3 Together, the five most common meningococcal serogroups account for 95 percent of all IMD cases worldwide, with serogroup B accounting for the majority of disease in adolescents and young adults in the U.S. and Europe.1In the U.S., the current meningococcal vaccination platform for adolescents and young adults includes a routine recommendation for MenACWY vaccines (two doses) and a separate, shared clinical decision recommendation for MenB-specific vaccines (two doses) in order to achieve the broadest serogroup protection available against meningococcal disease. However, less than a third of U.S. adolescents receive even one dose of a MenB vaccine, and fewer complete the series.4,5 If approved and recommended, Pfizer’s pentavalent vaccine candidate could be another option for the current routine recommendations in place for MenACWY vaccines. Pfizer’s pentavalent vaccine candidate could potentially reduce the total number of doses needed for individuals to be fully vaccinated against the five serogroups, thereby simplifying meningococcal vaccination and increasing the number of adolescents and young adults vaccinated.6 Routine use of a MenABCWY vaccine could reduce IMD cases and associated mortality, the rate of long-term sequelae in survivors, and costs associated with controlling outbreaks.7About the Pentavalent Meningococcal Vaccine Candidate (MenABCWY)Pfizer’s pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate combines the components from its two licensed meningococcal vaccines, Trumenba® (meningococcal group B vaccine) and Nimenrix® (meningococcal groups A, C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine); approvals of Nimenrix® and Trumenba® vary by country. Together, the 5 serogroups included in MenABCWY are responsible for the majority of currently circulating meningococcal disease globally.1 Top line results from a randomized, active-controlled and observer-blinded Phase 3 trial of Pfizer’s pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate (NCT04440163) were previously announced in September 2022.

The additional time will help reduce confusion during the upcoming 2023 tax filing season and provide more time for taxpayers to prepare and understand the new reporting requirements.”This lower threshold was enacted in the American Rescue Plan (ARP) back in March 2021. The new rules require users to report payment transactions via payment apps including Venmo, PayPal, Stripe and Square for goods and services meeting or exceeding $600 in the calendar year.The IRS added that it will provide additional details on the delay “in the near future,” along with additional information to help taxpayers and the industry.Related: What To Do if You Are Involved in a Venmo ScamFollowing the agency’s announcement, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has been a staunch critic of the new rule, said in a statement: “I am pleased the Treasury Department and the IRS listened to my request to delay the 1099-K reporting requirement that will harm small businesses and individuals who sell goods online across America.

202,dfd43853-1275-35d2-907d-aeb175bd3ccf,PYPL,2022-12-28,Returns On Capital At PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) Have Stalled,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-paypal-holdings-nasdaq-130045797.html,1672146045,STORY,['PYPL'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ:PYPL) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for PayPal Holdings, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$3.8b ÷ (US$76b - US$43b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, PayPal Holdings has an ROCE of 12%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PayPal Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PayPal Holdings here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has consistently earned 12% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 95% in that time. Since 12% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.On a side note, PayPal Holdings' current liabilities are still rather high at 57% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayThe main thing to remember is that PayPal Holdings has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. However, over the last five years, the stock hasn't provided much growth to shareholders in the way of total returns. For that reason, savvy investors might want to look further into this company in case it's a prime investment.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for PayPal Holdings  that we think you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:6.8% = US$1.4b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.07 in profit.Does International Business Machines Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, International Business Machines has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the IT industry classification.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 5 risks we have identified for International Business Machines by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Story continuesWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining International Business Machines' Debt And Its 6.8% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by International Business Machines, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.52. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Most Overvalued Companies According to the Media.The significant correction in the global equities markets over the past 11 months of 2022 has significantly reduced the number of overvalued stocks in the market. The correction has been due to uncertain economic circumstances stemming from rising inflation globally due to high commodity prices and geopolitical instability. This has caused the US Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world to increase the benchmark interest rates, which has dampened the growth outlook and heightened the probability of a recession.The renowned S&amp;P 500 Index is down over 17% since the start of the year and entered the bear market on numerous occasions this year. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index has lost over 29% of its value year-to-date (YTD) and has been in the bear market territory since August 2022. Publicly listed companies belonging to the cryptocurrency universe, the marijuana industry, and those that benefitted from the stay-at-home trends during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 have also seen a significant correction as they have lost as much as 80% to 90% of their underlying values.However, there are still numerous companies belonging to the healthcare, energy, industrials, media, and tech sectors that are still trading at a premium to their fair value. Recently we brought the most shorted stocks to your attention in an article. Most shorted stocks are the most overvalued companies, according to hedge funds and institutional investors.

This reflects a premium of over 39.3% as compared to the five-year forward P/E multiple of 11.67x. Furthermore, the adjusted PEG ratio of 1.96x is 28.3% higher than the sector median PEG ratio of 1.53x. Analysts think the overall valuation of the company looks expensive. The forward EV/EBIT for International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands at 17.81x, which shows a premium of 30.36% from the five-year average of 13.66x and a premium of 10.42% against the sector median of 16.13x.Here’s what St. James Investment Company said about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (Click here to see the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Flagged Overvalued by Number of Articles: 2Caterpillar Inc.

Furthermore, the company has a leading position in the manufacturing of mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stock is widely regarded as an industrial bell weather.The overvaluation of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) can be gauged by the fact that the stock is currently trading at a forward EV/Sales multiple of 2.52x, reflecting a premium of 54.4% from the sector median of 1.63x. Furthermore, this also represents a premium of 5.30% against the five-year forward EV/Sales multiple for the company.

Despite the broad market downturn, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stock has observed an increase of around 10% since the start of the year due to its defensive capabilities. However, experts now believe there is a high possibility of valuation compression as benchmark interest rates are rising.Diamond Hill Capital shared its outlook on Caterpillar Inc.

Here’s what the firm said:“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.

(NYSE:CAT) was held by 43 hedge funds.8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Flagged Overvalued by Number of Articles: 2Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) in the short term, which would adversely impact the P/S ratio in the future.Here’s what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”7. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Flagged Overvalued by Number of Articles: 2The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is an Arlington, Virginia-based designer, manufacturer, and seller of aerospace and defense equipment and services.The producer of the famous Boeing 747 aircraft is currently trading at a forward EV/Sales multiple of 2.27x, which translates into a premium of over 38.9% from the sector median of 1.63x and a premium of 8.07% against the company’s five-year average EV/Sales ratio of 2.10x. The possibility of an economic slowdown increases the likelihood of order cancellations as global business and vacation traveling have taken a serious hit during previous recessions. Furthermore, defense spending could also take a serious hit as governments would be forced to reduce spending to lower fiscal deficits. Experts think The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is heavily dependent on capital spending and is a cyclical stock in nature. The company lost 70% of its value during the Financial Crisis of 2007 and 65% of its value when the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s.Here’s what Meridian Funds said about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”As of Q3 2022, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was held by 42 hedge funds.6. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Flagged Overvalued by Number of Articles: 3 Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a San Ramon, California-based diversified, integrated oil company that is involved in the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments of the energy value chain.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock is currently trading at an adjusted forward P/E ratio of 8.76x, reflecting a premium of over 15.2% compared to the sector median adjusted forward P/E multiple of 7.60x. The premium valuation assumes the company needs to grow by high double-digits in the long term. This appears a daunting challenge as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has not experienced such an aggressive growth trajectory in the past.Furthermore, in case of a recession, crude oil prices could decline significantly, which would not also play in favor of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The stock has already experienced a meteoric rise of 43.1% since the start of 2022. The premium valuation of the stock was highlighted as the reason for downgrading the stock from a Buy to a Hold rating by Kim Fustier at HSBC. The analyst assigned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock a target price of $177 and added that there is a visible valuation gap between the US-based oil majors and their European counterparts.Here’s what Diamond Hill Capital said about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”In addition to Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) are also among the most overvalued companies according to the media.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Overvalued Companies According to the Media.   Suggested articles:20 Largest Hotel Chains in the World12 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics10 Jim Cramer Stock Picks This WeekDisclosure: None. 10 Most Overvalued Companies According to the Media is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Oil Companies in the World. While as a whole, 2022 has been a difficult year for business, as firms have struggled with high costs and rising interest rates, some industries have fared much better than others due to to the tumultuous global economic environment. One such industry is the oil industry, which saw renewed interest after the push to renewables had ended up reducing its prospects and favorability among investors.The Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in tough sanctions against Russia by the U.S. government which aimed to stem the flow of funds to Moscow so that it couldn't fund its war. The Americans were followed by the British, who also banned all Russian hydrocarbon imports, with the European Union also pitching in by announcing a plan to reduce the imports. The sanctions however led to a meteoric rise in crude oil prices, as all those who stopped buying Russian oil had to look elsewhere to meet their energy demands. Brent crude oil prices, which were already rising before February due to the post pandemic recovery, soared to a massive $139 per barrel in March.Naturally, the higher the price of your product, the more profit you make, and oil companies bathed in billions of dollars of profits this year. The petro majors of the world, or the largest oil companies on the planet, namely Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) raked in $20 billion, $11 billion, $9.5 billion, and $8 billion in net income, which is the amount available to the firm after all of its expenses have been taken out. Saudi Aramco, which is one of the world's largest oil companies, brought in another $42 billion. These profits were met by criticism from the U.S. administration, who asked the American companies to increase their production in order to bring the prices down. However, the oil companies, beholden to their shareholders, did not increase capacity, countering that any capacity increase today will yield results years into the future - when oil will be much cheaper than it is today.Story continuesHowever, with 2022 coming to an end, crude oil prices have now reversed most of their gains and even entered into negative territory in late November. Primary reasons for this are the worries of a recession in the U.S. and other advanced economies and the Chinese struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic three years after the first case was reported.Today we will look at the biggest oil companies in the world, with the notable picks being Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation (SHA:600028.SS)20 Biggest Oil Companies in the WorldPhoto by David Thielen on UnsplashOur Methodology We studied the oil industry to sift out the largest firms in terms of their revenue.

Tesla's ticker page was among the top three visited on Yahoo Finance, underscoring the ongoing angst on the always volatile stock.Tesla's decline finally took a bit of a breather on Wednesday, as it was up slightly above the flatline.But in the wake of the latest drop, the startling stats on Tesla's stock price (and anything tied to it) became that much more jaw-dropping:One-month: -41%Three-month: -60%Six-month: -55%Year-to-date: -70% (S&amp;P 500 -19%)Market cap lost year-to-date: $241 billionElon Musk net worth lost year-to-date: -$141 billionAnalysts contend the bottom is not yet in sight for the stock despite the bruising sell-off into 2023.""Musk set off this five-alarm fire on Tesla's stock and he is the only one that can extinguish it. It's a perfect storm between the Musk Twitter fiasco and now demand cracking,"" Wedbush analyst and vocal Musk critic Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance.In large part, the fact no one on the Street is trying to make a bottom call on Tesla's stock reflects the mounting bad news swirling around the company.First are the negative optics on demand both in the U.S. and China.Tesla said on its website last week it will offer $7,500 discounts on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles delivered in the U.S. in December. That coincides with analysts slashing fourth-quarter delivery estimates ahead of them being reported in early January.Then the elephant in the room remains — Musk's continued chaotic running of Twitter and how it may impact the operations of Tesla.The prospect of Musk selling more shares to fuel his turnaround at Twitter have also weighed on the stock. Musk said in a new Twitter spaces chat a week ago he wouldn't sell anymore Tesla shares until 2024 at the earliest. He has this year made similar proclamations only to subsequently sell more stock.Story continuesRege-Jean Page looks at Elon Musk as they arrive at the In America: An Anthology of Fashion themed Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York, U.S., May 2, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew KellyIn other words, investors simply do not believe Musk in this regard — and they are voicing that view loudly.Package all this up, along with the fact Tesla shares still trade on rich valuation multiples relative to the broad market, and you have a selling event that may not have run its course until a clear positive development emerges. (Musk handing over the CEO reigns at Twitter would be a huge help, analysts say.)Added Ives: ""We believe the stock is oversold, but it will be a rough ride ahead.""Sounds about right.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

The PNC Foundation also has partially underwritten FRP's award-winning series Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.The Realities Around UsStudies have shown about 6 in 10 parents say it's important for their children to see diversity reflected in the characters they view on screen, and that kind of positive representation not only goes a long way in affirming their experiences, it also provides opportunities for them to better understand cultures different from their own. 1""When our partners at Fred Rogers Productions shared the Alma's Way concept with us, we knew we wanted to play a part in bringing this important worldview and learning opportunity to young children,"" says Sally McCrady, chair and president of the PNC Foundation.

""The show has a very diverse development team, with a lot of us having lived in New York and a variety of other places.""The show's title refers to ""Alma's Way"" of seeing the world. Manzano wanted children to see that everyone's way is different and valid. In every story, Alma speaks directly to the audience in ""Think Through"" moments, where she reflects on a situation, considers others' points of view and makes tough decisions - all critical components of learning to think for herself.""A guiding principle Sonia put into place was, ‘I want kids to know that they have a mind and they can use it,'"" Olufemi says.""If You Can See It, You Can Be It""Alma, her family and some of her neighbors are Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, Dominican and even Bangladeshi, showing the breadth of the population in the neighborhood. Viewers get a lens into characters' lives and cultures, showing their worlds as they are, from the music they listen and dance to, to the Spanglish Alma speaks, to the mofongo Abuela Cecilia cooks - the recipe is even posted on the Alma's Way website.2The team wants to show kids ""if you can see it, you can be it,"" so the characters have a wide range of professions. Alma's Mami is a musician and music teacher and Papi is a veterinarian, while her Tía Gloria is a New York City transit conductor and Uncle Nestor is a playwright and musical director of a Bomba ensemble.""Studies in children's media show that positive representation of specific cultural and racial groups has a huge impact on how kids view themselves,"" Olufemi says. ""Likewise, not seeing someone whose hair or skin looks like yours. For example, I grew up reading Seventeen magazine and, at the time, none of the makeup shades they advertised worked for me. That means you don't exist. You grow up feeling outside, like you don't represent any sort of beauty or anything in the world.""Eddie Mambo, Alma's cousin, has cerebral palsy and is another example of intentional inclusion.""It was really important to us to have a character with a visible disability so they know he is different,"" Olufemi says. ""But there's no special episode about Eddie. He just is who he is.""Beyond the BroadcastAside from the PNC Foundation's involvement with Alma's Way and Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, PNC Grow Up Great and FRP have partnered since 2016 for Be My Neighbor Days that are celebrated in nearly 45 PNC markets across the country.""We have a mutual interest in families and getting them engaged, and that's where Be My Neighbor Days really took off,"" says Paul Siefken, president and CEO of Fred Rogers Productions, and ex officio member of the PNC Grow Up Great Advisory Council for PNC Grow Up Great.Siefken also noted that thinking about diversity, equity and inclusion should be key component when thinking about the work FRP does ""rather than an add-on.""""We're looking at how we can celebrate racial and ethnic identities in these events,"" he adds. ""We do this by working with community leaders and organizers on how Be My Neighbor Days can represent the people in the community and celebrate the children in that community in a meaningful way.""Delivering the MessageThat same commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion flows into its programming.While technology and the way we deliver media changes over time, the basic tenets of early childhood development remain the same, Siefken says.""It's still about children learning how to manage their feelings, interact with people and navigate the world they're living in,"" he explains. ""We have experts who have studied the way children's world view develops, so we can be sure we're speaking to them in an age-appropriate level. Daniel is for ages 2-4; Alma is for 4-6. It's a whole lifetime of difference in advancement, so the social-emotional learning is very different.""This early childhood tenet has led to a space where young viewers can learn and delight in the diverse cultural world of Alma's Way - a show with a little girl who has ""something say.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/733298/Animated-Series-Features-World-Through-Eyes-of-Latina-Character]"

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Target Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$170.2mUS$3.79bUS$3.96bUS$4.60bUS$5.87bUS$6.53bUS$7.08bUS$7.54bUS$7.92bUS$8.25bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 11.17%Est @ 8.41%Est @ 6.48%Est @ 5.13%Est @ 4.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$160US$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.6kUS$4.3kUS$4.4kUS$4.5kUS$4.5kUS$4.5kUS$4.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$182bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$182b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$96bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$133b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$146, the company appears quite undervalued at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Target as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.829. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TargetStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Multiline Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

Welcome to Target Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 16, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.John Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our third quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the fourth quarter and beyond. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the third quarter and his perspective on the upcoming holiday season. Brian?Storemike-petrucci-c9FQyqIECds-unsplashBrian Cornell: Thanks, John. As I begin the call today, I want to highlight the proactive leadership position we will continue to take as the operating environment changes. Just as we took decisive action in the second quarter to right-size our inventory, we're moving proactively in a period of rapidly softening demand and elevated uncertainty to successfully navigate near-term challenges alongside our team and in step with our guests. As we look specifically at third quarter results, they demonstrate how our business continues to serve our guests even in the face of an increasingly challenging backdrop. Because of the deepening level of trust we've established with our guests over the last several years, our top line continues to benefit from growth in guest traffic and unit share gains across all of our core categories.Story continuesThis is particularly notable as consumers are showing increasing signs of stress and pulling back from discretionary purchases, and it reinforces the value of having a balanced multi-category portfolio, which allows us to satisfy our guests' ever-changing wants and needs. In today's environment, that means we continue to benefit from strong growth and market share gains in the categories our guests are leaning into most right now, including Food &amp; Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials. Q3 comparable sales grew 2.7% on top of 12.7% a year ago and 20.7% in the third quarter of 2020. As you recall, early in the second quarter, we announced we would be taking decisive inventory actions based on the rapid change in consumer buying patterns that emerged near the end of the first quarter.These actions were designed to ensure we could continue to provide what our guests know and love about Target. More specifically, the effort was designed to free up space in our stores and hours for our team to continue offering fresh inventory and a reliable, uncluttered shopping experience for our guests, setting up our business to deliver strong growth in Q3. Among the drivers of our comparable sales, third quarter traffic expanded 1.4% on top of 12.9% growth a year ago. In addition to traffic growth, we saw a 1.3% increase in average ticket as guests continue to rely on Target for convenient, reliable one-stop shop. Across our merchandise categories and similar to the second quarter, we saw a very strong growth in our frequency businesses, led by double-digit growth in both Beauty and Food &amp; Beverage.That strength offset persistent softness in our discretionary categories, which worsened at the end of the quarter. Christina will provide more detail in a few minutes. While overall Q3 comp growth was nearly identical to our second quarter performance, we experienced dramatically different trends within the quarter. More specifically, through the first two months of the quarter, we had seen comp growth of well over 3%, and then saw a deceleration to just under 1% in October. Even within the month of October results in the back half of the month were much softer than in the first half and the mix of our sales tilted much more heavily towards promotions. This rapid change in trend is consistent with what we're seeing in syndicated data on broader industry trends and the feedback we're hearing from our guests.More specifically, consumers are feeling increasing levels of stress, driven by persistently high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and an elevated sense of uncertainty about their economic prospects. With high rates of inflation contouring the road, their purchasing power, many consumers this year have relied on borrowing or dipping into their savings to manage their weekly budgets. But for many consumers, those options are starting to run out. As a result, our guests are exhibiting increasing price sensitivity, becoming more focused on and responsive to promotions and more hesitant to purchase at full price. On the profit line, we saw an expected improvement in the third quarter as we move beyond the bulk of those costs from our second quarter inventory actions.However, Q3 profitability came in well below our expectations, driven by several factors. First and foremost, we faced an unexpected gross margin rate headwind from a higher-than-expected mix of promotional sales as guests moved away from full price purchases. In addition, like the rest of the industry, we're facing a growing financial headwind from shortage, which is running hundreds of millions of dollars higher than a year ago. Along with other retailers, we've seen a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business. As a result, we're making significant investments in training and technology that can deter that and keep our guests and store team members safe. Looking ahead and taking recent trends into account, our team is making adjustments in real-time with agility and flexibility in light of the revised expectations for both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter.It's in tough environments like these that we're most fortunate to have a durable business model and a strong balance sheet, allowing us to maintain our focus on long-term investments and market share opportunities at a time when many others will be forced to pull back. And to create additional capacity for us to continue investing in long-term growth and market share while also delivering strong bottom line performance, we are undertaking an enterprise-wide effort to identify opportunities to simplify and enhance the efficiencies of our business. I want to make it clear. This effort is not about slashing resources, instead, it's about optimizing our operations to match the scale of our business. This effort is particularly important today because of the rapid and unanticipated level of scale our business is added since 2019 as total revenues have grown from less than $80 billion in 2019 to a projection of well over $100 billion this year.While our team has done an excellent job of staying agile and quickly accommodating all that growth, we now have an opportunity to look from top to bottom across all of our operations to ensure they are fully optimized for the size of our business. We're still in the process of fully scoping out this effort, but we believe it presents an opportunity to save a total of $2 billion to $3 billion over the next three years in support of our investments in long-term growth, along with our profit goals. In the near term, our team is energized and laser-focused on bringing the best of Target to our guests throughout the holiday season, knowing it's critically important for Target to be there for them during the busiest time of the year. Our team is committed to offering value across our entire assortment through great everyday prices, unbeatable value on our owned brands and accessible opening price points in every category.In addition, we'll highlight our compelling and simple promotions, free services like Drive-Up and in-store pickup and new accessible payment options. And of course, we'll provide additional savings opportunities through our RedCard and Target Circle programs, neither of which has a membership fee. So as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to thank the entire Target team for your energy, your spirit, your care for each other and your passion for our guests and our brand. You're the reason that Target has such a positive impact on the communities where we live and work and the reason we're known as a welcoming and inclusive brand. Thank you, and happy holidays to all of you. With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina.See also What Are the Most Valuable Brands in the World? and 12 Best Performing Dividend Stocks.Christina Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. The current retail environment requires tremendous levels of flexibility, resilience, stamina and focus, a balance our team continues to carry out at every guest interaction. Consumers are strained as they work to support their families' day-to-day needs while looking for the occasional affordable luxury, prepping for the changing seasons and planning for the holidays. It's a difficult balance to strike in getting increasingly difficult each week as more and more of their household budget goes towards the needs of the family, which limits the amount available for discretionary purchases. So it follows that of the many considerations that our guests are currently juggling, we consistently hear that value remains at the top of the list.We see our guests holding out for and expecting promotions more than ever, spending less on regularly priced items. When they shop our frequency categories, some guests are trading into smaller pack sizes, opening price point options or owned brands to reduce their spending on a single trip. Others are opting for larger pack sizes or stocking up when items are on promotion, knowing they will receive greater per unit value. And these trends only became more pronounced towards the end of the third quarter when spending patterns change dramatically. With inflationary food prices absorbing more of their spending, those costs are crowding out other categories, including spending on discretionary items, and in some cases, even household essentials.However, we also know both from our recent performance and from guest surveys that despite the pressures they're facing, our guests want to celebrate the holidays in person with loved ones, and they're looking for Target to provide them safety, ease and joy as they prepare for every celebration. These themes played out in the third quarter as guests responded increasingly to promotions, even as they celebrated key seasonal moments like back-to-school, college and Halloween. Among our frequency categories, Beauty continues to drive strong performance, delivering sales growth in the mid-teens. Skin care, hair care and cosmetics, all performed very well and our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings nearly tripled their total sales volume when compared to this period a year ago.Food &amp; Beverage continues to outperform the market with low double-digit growth and strength across the portfolio, gaining both dollar and unit share every week throughout the quarter. Comparable sales in Essentials categories grew in the low single digits, reflecting particular strength in pets and health. While already soft, sales trends in our discretionary categories softened even more in the last few weeks of the quarter, a trend that's persisted into the first few weeks of November. But importantly, despite this challenging environment, we still saw unit share gains in all five of our core merchandising categories in the quarter, a sign that when guests are looking for convenience and value on both wants and needs, they're increasingly turning to Target.Apparel comps were down only slightly in Q3, driven by growth in kids, men's, seasonal and new fashion forward assortments, offset by softness in swim, women's accessories and basics. In Home, sales declined in the mid-single digits despite strong performance in seasonal areas. Hardlines sales were also down mid-single digits reflecting continued softness in home electronics and sporting goods. Additionally, we saw a meaningful deceleration in toys this quarter, most notably in October. This is a trend we will continue to monitor closely as we move throughout the holiday season. Across the portfolio, owned brands continue to outperform their national brand counterparts, growing at double the rate of the total enterprise in the third quarter.Because of our unique industry-leading, in-house design and sourcing capabilities, Target's exclusive owned brands provide tremendous quality at incredibly competitive prices, a great combination anytime, but never more so than in an inflationary environment. So as we turn our focus to Q4, we'll do what we always do, work tirelessly to deliver value and solutions to our guests while also delivering affordable joy at a time when they need it most. As we've outlined this morning, we're taking a prudent approach to our inventory planning and sales expectations for the fourth quarter in light of the concerning industry trends we've seen over the past several weeks. But even with this cautious stance, we're focused on providing our guests with affordability and ease at every interaction with the Target brand.One of the signature ways we plan to stand out this holiday season is through our focus on the combination of newness and value, which cut across all our core categories. Given that the gift-giving season is underway and our guests are turning to Target more and more for their Food &amp; Beverage needs, it's an ideal time for our recently announced partnership with British retailer, Marks &amp; Spencer, who has collaborated with us to offer a limited time assortment of gourmet, premium food and chocolates, that's sure to be a perfect gifting solution this holiday season. Despite recent trends in toys, we know they will play a critical role for our guests over the holiday season, and we have all the top toys and exclusives this year at incredible prices.Back by popular demand, our exclusive assortment from FAO Schwarz features more than 120 toys. And for all the Marvel fans out there, the first-of-its-kind collaboration between Target and Disney will feature exclusive Black Panther merchandise and experiences, including the only-at-Target, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever War on the Water LEGO set. And the power of these partnerships doesn't stop there. We've added nearly 50 Disney shop-in-shop experiences this year, bringing the total to well over 200 of these shops across the country. In partnership with Apple, we've more than tripled the number of shop-in-shops since last year, and our Target Circle members have access to free trials of some incredible Apple services, including a free four-month trial of Apple Fitness+.And with Ulta Beauty at Target, we'll have opened another 250 locations this year and now have more than 350 locations open across the chain. Through all our new tried-and-true and exclusive holiday offerings, we'll remain laser-focused on supporting our value proposition with key deals starting earlier than ever. Week-long Black Friday deals and our guest-favorite Deal of the Day offers are available now and feature our best plan prices for the season, with prices up to 50% off across toys and games, electronics, kitchen appliances and more. Besides industry-leading promotions, we are offering compelling, easy to shop, everyday price points on key items like $3 Christmas ornaments, $5 holiday Wondershop and candle assortments, and $10 gifting assortments across categories like Beauty, Apparel and Home.And to reinforce our commitment to value, we'll be offering free and easy payment and fulfillment options, including our recently launched reloadable RedCard, which provides all the benefits of our RedCard debit and credit programs, including free shipping and 5% off every purchase, all without the need for a credit check or an existing bank account. Combine this with our easy, convenient and free same-day service options like Drive-Up and order pickup, all with no membership fees and our free-to-join loyalty program, Target Circle, we have an unmatched combination of value-added and affordable shopping experiences to help our guests celebrate and amplify the joy of the holidays. Throughout the season, we will remain nimble and respond to changes in consumer promotional and macro trends, always in service of optimizing current and long-term performance.And despite the challenges facing our business and our guests, we have a not-so-secret-weapon to help us provide joy and value for our guests, a world-class team. Like Brian, I want to pause and add my sincere gratitude for the Target team. No matter what is thrown your way, you execute with grace compassion and consistency, a combination that leads our guests to return to our stores and website time and time again. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.John Mulligan: Thanks, Christina. Across the operations team, we focus every day on delivering strong execution, even as we continue to keep our eyes on and invest in projects that will support Target's long-term profitable growth. As you know, throughout the year, our supply chain and transportation teams have been continuously navigating through an unpredictable environment, and these volatile conditions continued in the third quarter. The good news is that the lead times in global shipping has started to move in the right direction. More specifically, compared with the second quarter, lead times improved by about 15% in Q3, and we're more than three weeks shorter than a year ago. While we were really pleased to see this improvement, the acceleration was faster than we expected, causing many overseas orders to arrive earlier than needed.As a result, the team has been reducing lead times on our future orders just as they extended them during the pandemic. In addition, to prevent early arrivals from entering our distribution and store network before they are needed, the team has implemented multiple strategies and tactics, including new processes to efficiently segment shipping containers as they arrive at domestic ports, allowing early arriving containers to age before sending them downstream into our regional distribution centers. So today, even as we continue to look heavy on the balance sheet, our inventory is in a much healthier position than earlier in the year. Because the heaviness you're seeing today is due to the early arrival of fresh inventory, we are planning to sell.For example, by early November of this year, nearly 90% of our key Q4 programs had already moved into our distribution centers and stores. In contrast, last year, just over half our key programs were in the network as of the same time frame. Similar to our experience with lead times, we saw improvement across multiple dimensions of our transportation costs in the quarter, even as those costs remain above pre-pandemic levels. Container rates in global shipping have come down by about one-third in recent months, and we'll realize that benefit in 2023 as we renegotiate our staggered contracts with shipping partners. And importantly, we expect to see further reductions in those rates going forward as they remain about 3 times higher than we were paying in 2019.Similarly, domestic transportation rates have come down since the beginning of the year, but remain higher than a year ago and double the rates we were facing in 2019. And of course, fuel costs, which are a major driver of our domestic transportation expense, are still running more than double the amount we were paying in 2019 despite having moderated in recent months. Now I'll turn to the work of our properties team, where we're still wrapping up some projects but close to completing our supply chain and store projects for the year. On the distribution side, we're continuing our work to build replenishment capacity across the country, given the amount of growth we've delivered over the last few years. The other big addition to our distribution infrastructure is the build-out of our sortation center strategy.A year ago, we were operating a single sort center here in the Minneapolis market. And this year, we've opened five more with several more on track to open in 2023. These centers, which are typically a little bigger than a single store, increase our speed and meaningfully reduce our last-mile delivery costs in the markets where they operate. They also create backroom fulfillment capacity in the stores they serve, as they eliminate the need for each individual store to sort the boxes they've packed for delivery. On the store side, we are on track to complete about 200 full remodel projects this year in which we update every part of the store to reflect our latest thinking and offer a modern and inspirational shopping experience for our guests.Beyond full remodels, we're also on track to complete about 200 fulfillment retrofits this year in which we optimize their capacity and efficiency in supporting our same-day services. And finally, the team is on track to complete our new store program for 2022, in which we plan to add 23 new locations to the chain. The size of these new stores ranges widely from 19,000 to 145,000 square feet as we continue to open the right size store for the neighborhood we're serving. And as we've mentioned in recent calls, based on evolving conditions in the commercial real estate market, we've been finding more and more opportunities to open larger locations that can offer the full range of our assortment, along with a full suite of fulfillment options to serve our guests.In light of that opportunity, just over a week ago, we opened the first example of a new larger store prototype in the Houston, Texas market. At nearly 150,000 square feet, this new format incorporates our latest thinking in store design, featuring a more open layout, localized elements to inspire and serve our guests, 5 times more space to support our digital fulfillment services and sustainable features in support of our Target-forward goals. While we'll continue to open new stores of all sizes in the next few years, we plan to lean into this new layout when appropriate and incorporate its features into other projects, including remodels. Among the many innovations we've incorporated into this new location in Houston, we've added two new Drive-Up services.The first is the ability for a guest to order a beverage from Starbucks on their way to pick up their Drive-Up order. We started testing this new service in the second quarter with a limited menu in a small number of stores, allowing us to collect feedback and fine-tune operations before expanding it more broadly. Based on the success of that pilot, earlier this month, we rolled it out to more than 200 additional stores across the country, just in time for the holidays. The other emerging capability is the ability for a guest to return a purchase through our Drive-Up service. We began testing this service only a month ago with our team members in a small number of stores, consistent with our test-and-iterate approach. Based on the operational success of that initial test, in early November, we expanded the service to our guests in that same small set of stores, and we'll look to apply any learnings from that guest-facing test before rolling out the service more broadly next year.So now before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to pause and thank our teams across the country who have worked tirelessly to ensure we are staffed and ready to serve our guests during the upcoming holiday season, our busiest time of the year. Consistent with prior years, before determining our seasonal hiring goals, we focused first on providing opportunities to our existing team to support their desired hours and backup training interests. And today, based on all that hard work in preparation, I'm happy to report that we're entering the holiday season in a very healthy staffing position, reflecting our success in hiring throughout the year, the significant wage investments we've made throughout the country, an increase in the number of team members who are looking to pick up extra hours and an 18% increase in applicants for seasonal positions compared with a year ago.As Brian mentioned, it's in times like these that we feel most fortunate to have a durable business model, which can sustain us through an ever more challenging economic and consumer backdrop and allow us to emerge with additional profitable growth and market share opportunities over time. That's why we're ensuring our teams are staying focused on our guests and taking the right actions to continue deepening our relationship with them. If we maintain that guest focus, I'm confident we'll find ourselves in an even stronger competitive position over time. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.Michael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. I want to start where John just ended and reiterate how closely we're listening to our guests, ensuring we understand how they're feeling and how that is affecting their shopping behavior and moving quickly to serve their rapidly-changing needs. Obviously, if recent softening consumer trends continue through the fourth quarter, that will put some pressure on our near-term financial performance. But with a durable model and an agile team, we can navigate those challenges and emerge even stronger in the long-term while continuing to deepen our relationship with guests and build long-term preference for Target. Once again, this quarter, I'm going to begin my remarks by covering our inventory position, given that it continues to be an important area of focus.And like last quarter, I'm going to base my discussion on comparisons to 2019, given the highly volatile conditions that have affected inventory since the onset of the pandemic. As you saw on our balance sheet this morning, we owned $17.1 billion of inventory at the end of the third quarter, which is $5.7 billion higher than the end of Q3 2019. In percentage terms, this year's number represents an approximate 50% increase from three years ago, a deceleration from three-year growth of 68% as of the end of the second quarter. Of the dollar increase in our inventory since 2019, about two-thirds or $3.9 billion is aligned with our sales growth over that same three-year period. The remaining one-third or about $1.8 billion is new inventory that's arrived early relative to when it would have been received in pre-pandemic years.This early inventory is being driven by two related factors. The first is our explicit decision to add cushion to our lead times this year in order to mitigate the risk we were facing a year ago when the bulk of our global shipments were arriving late. The second factor is the unexpectedly rapid acceleration in the global supply chain that we saw in Q3, which caused us to receive shipments even earlier than scheduled. It's also important to note that the composition of our inventory continues to evolve as we've leaned into frequency categories where we're seeing robust growth and taken an increasingly cautious position in discretionary categories. More specifically, the percent of our inventory units in discretionary categories was 8 percentage points lower than at the end of Q2 and lower than in 2019 as well.With that context, I'll turn to our third quarter financial performance, beginning with the top line. Total sales grew 3.3% in the third quarter, the same as in Q2, driven by a 2.7% increase in comparable sales, combined with the benefit of new stores. Total revenue grew 3.4% in Q3, reflecting a 9.5% increase in other revenue, which was driven by the growth in our Roundel ad business. Traffic continues to be an important driver of our growth, having expanded 1.4% in Q3 on top of nearly 13% growth a year ago. In addition, this quarter, we benefited from a 1.3% increase in average ticket. Among our sales channels, stores continue to drive our growth as we saw a 3.2% increase in store comparable sales in Q3 on top of nearly 10% growth a year ago.Comparable sales in our digital channel grew 0.3% in the quarter on top of nearly 30% last year. Same-day services led our digital growth, most notably through our Drive-Up service, which delivered high single-digit growth on top of more than 80% growth last year. As Brian mentioned, while our overall Q3 comp increase was consistent with Q2, we saw a dramatic change in the pace and composition of our business toward the end of the third quarter. More specifically, within the quarter, comparable sales grew 2.8% in August, rose to 4% in September and decelerated to 0.9% in October. Also notable, even within the October period, there was a dramatic change in the pace of our sales. As you'll recall, the month began with an initial round of holiday promotions from Target and some of our competitors, and in that week, we saw a high single-digit increase in comp sales compared with last year.However, for the remainder of the month, we saw a low single-digit decline in comp sales over those last three weeks. Nearly all of the slowdown was driven by our discretionary categories, Apparel, Home and Hardlines, as our guests became increasingly cautious in their spending in those categories at both Target and throughout the industry more broadly. So far in the month of November, trends have been largely consistent with what we were seeing at the end of October, in terms of our comp trends, the mix of sales between frequency and discretionary businesses and the focus on promotions by our guests. While our Q3 gross margin rate of 24.7% was more than 3 percentage points higher than in Q2, it came in far short of our expectations, driven by three factors.The primary driver was a higher-than-expected markdown impact from promotions as our guests became increasingly price-sensitive and concentrated their discretionary spending on items on promotion, most notably in the latter weeks of the quarter. While we anticipated a highly promotional environment this fall, given the excess inventory we had been seeing across retail, this enhanced focus on promotions reflects an increasing level of stress on consumers as they navigate through multiple headwinds, including persistent inflation and rapidly rising interest rates. A second factor that's impacting our gross margin is inventory shortage, or shrink, which is a growing problem facing all retailers. At Target year-to-date, incremental shortage has already reduced our gross margin by more than $400 million versus last year, and we expect it will reduce our gross margin by more than $600 million for the full year.As Brian mentioned, this is an industry-wide problem that is often driven by criminal networks, and we are collaborating with multiple stakeholders to find industry-wide solutions. For example, because stolen goods are often sold online, Target strongly supports the passage of legislation to increase accountability and prevent criminals from selling stolen goods through online marketplaces. A third factor that affected our Q3 gross margin was the incremental cost of managing early inventory. In the near-term, these pressures should begin to recede as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year as receipt flow naturally moderates following the holiday season and we'll begin to benefit from the reduction in order lead times John mentioned earlier.And finally, regarding gross margin, category mix moved from being a slight headwind in Q2 to a small tailwind in Q3, contributing about 20 basis points of gross margin benefit in the quarter. This change in mix impact might seem counterintuitive given some of the category trends I highlighted earlier. However, underneath the surface of discretionary comps when compared to our second quarter results, comp sales in Apparel, a high-margin discretionary category, got stronger in Q3, while comps in Hardlines, a lower-margin discretionary category saw a deceleration in the third quarter. Moving down to the SG&amp;A expense line. We saw a small amount of deleverage in Q3, even as we continue to benefit from disciplined cost management across the organization.In spite of that discipline, we're facing inflationary cost pressures across multiple expense lines in the P&amp;L. Within compensation, expenses reflect ongoing investments in hourly team member pay and benefits, partially offset by a year-over-year rate benefit from lower incentive compensation expense. Altogether, on the operating income line, on both a dollar and rate basis, we saw a year-over-year decline of about 50% in the third quarter. I want to emphasize that we're not happy with this performance and expect to deliver much stronger dollar and rate performance over time. Now I want to turn to capital deployment. And as always, I'll start by reiterating our priorities, which have been consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria.Then we look to support our dividend and build on our 50-year record of annual dividend increases. And finally, we devote any excess cash beyond these first two uses to repurchase our shares over time within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. Beginning with our first priority, capital expenditures have come in at about $4.3 billion through the first three quarters of the year, and we're now expecting our full year CapEx will come in around $5.5 billion in light of continued inflationary pressures affecting the cost of this year's projects. We paid just under $500 million in dividends in the third quarter, up from $440 million a year ago, reflecting a 20% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in our average share count.And finally, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter, given current financial performance and the working capital investments we've made to support in-stocks and early receipts. In the near-term, we will continue to take a very cautious approach to share repurchase in light of the volatility of the environment and our commitment to maintaining our middle A credit ratings. So now I want to close my Q3 review with a discussion of our after-tax return on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months of the third quarter of this year, our after-tax ROIC was 14.6% compared with 31.3% a year ago. While this is a disappointing decline, a mid-teens after-tax return on capital is still very healthy in absolute terms and a testament to the durability of our business.Importantly, we expect to see a significant recovery from this number over time as we move beyond the unusual headwinds that have been affecting our business this year. Now let me turn briefly to our expectations for the fourth quarter. In the current environment, we're facing an even higher degree of uncertainty than a quarter ago given the volatility we've been seeing recently. And in light of the dramatic changes in shopping patterns we've seen both at Target and across the industry, we believe it's prudent to plan for a wide range of comparable sales outcomes in the fourth quarter that's centered around a low single-digit comp decline, consistent with recent trends. Underlying the sales expectation, we're planning for softer discretionary category comps than we've seen in the last two quarters, partially offset by the benefit of continued strong growth in our frequency businesses.If these sales trends persist, we'd see far less of a benefit from leverage on fixed expenses than we've seen so far this year. In addition, we'd expect greater markdown pressure from Q4 promotions given the increase in price sensitivity our guests have shown recently and our commitments to end the year with a clean inventory position, especially in those categories where trends have softened. And as I mentioned, we're planning for additional pressure from inventory shrink, given the worsening trends that have emerged so far this year. Altogether, these expectations lead to a wide range for our expected Q4 operating margin rate centered around 3%. The single-most sensitive input to this profit projection is the level of demand for our discretionary businesses.If that demand improves from recent trends, we would expect fewer markdowns and would likely outperform our updated profit expectations; while if demand softened further, profit could see additional pressure. As we look beyond the holiday season, we're planning for a continued challenging environment as we move into next year. And as John and Brian already pointed out, we are fortunate to have a durable model that is well-positioned to continue serving our guests even in the toughest of times. In addition, we have a significant opportunity to harness efficiencies in support of our long-term growth and profit goals. At the end of 2019, our operations had been built to support a business that delivered $77 billion in sales that year. And our long-term algorithm at the time was anticipating low single-digit top line growth in the years ahead.If things had played out that way, we might be looking at a total sales number in the low to mid-$80 billion range this year. Instead, even in the midst of a very challenging environment, we're positioned to deliver total sales of well over $100 million this year. So today, we have a compelling opportunity to look across our operations with an eye to simplifying and optimizing those operations for a more than $100 billion business. And today, as we look at the operations we have and where we think they can be, we believe there's a $2 billion to $3 billion savings opportunity over the next three years. To be clear, this isn't about slashing resources. And in particular, we're focused on continuing to invest in our team, which is our most valuable asset.As Brian said, we are in the initial stages of scoping this opportunity and we expect to share detail on our progress at our 2023 Financial Community Meeting. In the meantime, I want to join Brian and wishing all of you a happy holiday season, and I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for making Target a great place to work and a store that's ready to bring joy to millions of our guests throughout this season and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.Brian Cornell: Before we turn to your questions, I want to relay a few thoughts that I shared with our Target team earlier today. While the circumstances we're facing are difficult and certainly not what anyone would wish for, we need to embrace the moment, focus on what we can control and lean into our strengths. Because even as we face multiple challenges, all at the same time, we have an even longer list of strengths on our side. And there are quite a few headwinds, but we've shown time and time again that our strengths can overcome any challenge we face. We have nearly 2,000 well-located, well-maintained store locations. We have a rapidly growing set of owned brands that are already generating more than $30 billion in annual sales.And we have a unique and growing list of national brand partners, including Starbucks, CVS Health, Levi's, Apple, Disney and Ulta Beauty. Our unmatched product design, development and sourcing capabilities allow us to offer an unbeatable combination of price, quality, design and fashion throughout our own brand portfolio. We have a durable operating model and a balanced portfolio of merchandise categories, which allow us to pivot quickly in a rapidly changing environment. Our operations are profitable, generate robust cash flow and are backed by a strong balance sheet that enables continued investment during lean times. And of course, we have a unique, amazing, passionate team that has only grown stronger over the last few years. So this morning, I've asked our team to focus on what they do best, moving with agility and responding to the environment in real-time, delivering outstanding execution throughout the holiday season and beyond and doing it all as one team, aligned in support of our guests and each other.While we'd all prefer to be operating in a more robust environment, today, we have the opportunity and all the resources we need to continue playing offense while many others cannot. By harnessing the strength of our assets and our amazing team, I'm confident we'll continue to grow guest engagement and deliver compelling growth on both the top and bottom line over time. With that, we can move to Q&amp;A. Now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

For more companies that sometimes end up employing more than a million people, head on over to 5 Biggest Employers in the World. Employment or the number of people that have a full time job is a crucial factor for any economy. Growth in employment, and the corresponding fall in unemployment, signals economic progress as more people have more money available to make purchases. However, as has been evident this year, too much employment often ends up worrying policymakers as well, since it can contribute to inflation and end up permanently increasing prices.The biggest example of this factor is the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike cycle for 2022. Throughout the course of this year, the Fed has raised the rate at which banks can lend money to each other in order to bring down inflation. As part of its decision making process, the central bank has been on the lookout for several metrics, one of which is the employment rate. The importance of unemployment to inflation was summed up by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Mr. Jerome Powell, who in a speech in late November at the Brookings Institution, outlined that:Finally, the labor market, which is especially important for inflation in core services ex housing, shows only tentative signs of rebalancing, and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.The Fed, as counterintuitive as it sounds, is hoping for unemployment to rise and job growth to reduce in order to slow down the economy and ensure that inflation in the U.S. comes down to the 2% goal. It isn't alone in this fight, and the Bank of England, in a recent statement tied together the link between higher costs, higher wages, low unemployment, and then higher prices, as part of a vicious cycle when it outlined:Story continuesThere is also pressure on prices from developments in the United Kingdom. Businesses are charging more for their products because of the higher costs they face. There are more job vacancies than there are people to fill them, as fewer people are seeking work following the pandemic. That means that employers are having to offer higher wages to attract job applicants. Prices for services have risen markedly.Today we will take a look at which companies are the largest employers in the world, but, if we were to include government bodies in our list too then you'd find that the United States Department of Defense (DoD) is one of the largest employers all around with a 2.9 million strong workforce. Other large government employers are the People's Liberation Army of China and the Russian Ministry of Defense. However, on the corporate side of things, some examples are Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Volkswagen AG (FRA:VOW3.DE).

The value of the retailer’s stock is decreasing, and their third-quarter earnings were disappointing.Take a Look Back: 2022 Year in ReviewLearn: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Target is considered a store for higher-income shoppers than say Walmart, for example, so in the wake of inflation, many shoppers switched from Target to Walmart for their needs. “Amid high inflation, shoppers are opting to trade down to cheaper retailers, brands, and products. Walmart has noted how it has been seeing shoppers with a household income of $100,000+ devote a greater share of their wallet to Walmart, boosting their results,” Tim Campbell, Director of Insights at CommerceIQ, said.But, how has this impacted Target shoppers? GOBankingRates talked to experts to see how Target consumers were affected, and what they can expect to see in 2023.Excess Inventory Leads to Big DiscountsExcess inventory was a huge problem for Target this year, however, that translated to good news for consumers. If you saw incredible deals–especially for the holidays, that’s due to a surplus of inventory the retailer had. Because of the extra inventory, customers might have seen more mess in terms of aisle organization, but Campbell says that’s probably going to be cleaned up next year. “The inventory glut at Target caused by overly optimistic forecasts for growth in discretionary goods in 2022 will likely be fully resolved in 2023, so shoppers can expect to see more orderly stores with better merchandising.”As for low prices, Campbell says consumers will still benefit from those in 2023, especially from Target’s brands. Look for big deals from all 45 of Target’s private label brands including A New Day, Market Pantry, Cat &amp; Jack, Room Essentials, Everspring, Good &amp; Gather, up &amp; up, and Universal Thread, to name a few.Take Our Poll: Do You Think Student Loan Debt Should Be Forgiven?Don’t Expect Discounts on FoodThough consumers can look forward to Target reducing the cost of clothing and electronics, if you’re shopping for groceries, you won’t see much of a price reduction. During times of inflation, consumers tend to cut out discretionary spending, but they still need groceries. Target reported that their food and beverage sales surpassed every other category of spending in 2022. Needless to say, they don’t have to slash prices for customers to buy, so there probably won’t be any major sales.Story continuesPaper Coupons Aren’t Always Accepted AnymoreIf you were relying on coupons to shop at Target, you might want to switch to digital ones only, as it will be a bit more difficult to use your paper ones. Recently, due to an increase in fraudulent coupons, Target now only accepts coupons that can be validated through their master file of barcodes. Because of this, customers have reported that their paper coupons are getting rejected more frequently than before.Your best bet is to use Target coupons you find in the Target app, as those are automatically valid, and don’t have to be checked against the database of barcodes.More In-Store Displays Elevate Shopping ExperienceIn spite of the rising cost of goods, Target made it a point to stand out among the competition with engaging in-store displays. “Despite recessionary trends, Target remains committed to remodels that upgrade the look and feel of their in-store experience,” Campbell said, citing Target’s partnership with Ulta as an example. Customers looking to try before they buy will find a lot of opportunity to do so inside the Target stores.Target Expected To Continue To Appeal to High-Income ShoppersAs Campbell discussed, Target caters to a customer within a certain income bracket. Surprisingly, even after a lackluster year, the retailer has no plans to try and rebrand who they appeal to. Though there will continue to be a lot of sales, Target will still offer goods that other retailers just won’t. ​​For example, the company recently announced a partnership with British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer to sell a limited-time assortment of gourmet premium food and chocolates. It’s items like those that will continue to set Target apart as the retailer hopes to hold onto its spot as a store for higher income shoppers. Technology Industry Analyst Jeff Kagan says if they can do that, they’ll survive. “Target wants and needs a strong economy and low inflation to flourish and grow as a whole. However, they are more insulated from tough economic times compared to some of their competitors who have [lower income] shoppers.”Going into 2023, keep an eye out for the best sales by using the Target app, and expect prices on clothing and electronics to stay lower for a while.More From GOBankingRatesZelle Scams on Facebook Marketplace: How To Recognize and Avoid ThemTake a Look Back: 2022 Year in ReviewThe 10 Best Cash Back Credit Cards for 20236 Best Ways to Help You Keep Your Identity and Credit SafeThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Did Inflation Affect Target Shoppers in 2022?]"
224,acda6443-a8e5-3ca0-aa4a-011cf62ef9f7,TGT,2022-12-28,Target Corporation (TGT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporation-tgt-trending-stock-140002024.html,1672149602,STORY,['TGT'],"[Target (TGT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this retailer have returned -13.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Target belongs, has lost 8.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Target is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -55.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.54 points to a change of -59.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.9%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.61 indicates a change of +73.5% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $30.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1%. The $108.43 billion and $111.58 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.3% and +2.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.4%. EPS of $1.54 for the same period compares with $3.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.62%. The EPS surprise was -28.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 largest healthcare companies by market cap.Competition should always be encouraged in the business world. After all, competition breeds innovation and innovation results in better advancements that improve the quality of our lives. The improvement in standard of living in just the past few decades is incredible and versus the previous century, it is almost unthinkable how far humanity has progressed.However, it is a debatable topic that some industries should be regulated more by the governments and shouldn't be for profit. One of these industries is the healthcare industry, where literally the lives of people are on the line. In most of the developed countries in the world, healthcare is regulated by the government, with socialized healthcare available to its citizens and residents. In fact, the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where the healthcare industry is for-profit, which is why 11 of the 15 largest healthcare companies by market cap are located in the U.S.15 largest healthcare companies by market capPhoto by CDC on UnsplashOn one hand, allowing the healthcare industry to remain for-profit allows for greater competition and innovation, as companies are highly motivated to invest in and develop new solutions to problems. Many of the advancements made in the healthcare industry come from the U.S. which is also the most technologically advanced country in the world precisely because of the high level of competition and freedom allowed to companies operating within the country, as compared to Western Europe, where focus is higher on consumer rights and companies have to comply with strict regulations that can stifle innovation, and be detrimental to consumers as companies do not have the same level of freedom to operate and developed new technologies. On the other hand, allowing companies freehand to do as they please is a recipe for disaster as well, as profits need to be balanced with the benefit to the general population. This is one place where the U.S. has struggled, with healthcare companies often raising prices significantly enough that if you don't have private insurance, even a normal routine procedure can result in your life savings being drained at a moment's notice.Story continuesThe global healthcare industry, according to The Business Research Company, was worth $6.8 trillion in 2021 and was expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% to reach $7.5 trillion in 2022, which shows that there is a lot of potential for growth in the industry and identifying the companies leading this growth is important in making the best possible investment decisions. Innovation is the driver of success and according to fDi Intelligence, the healthcare industry is among the most innovative industries in the world. Many of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world are among the biggest R&amp;D spenders in the world, while from our list of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap, Siemens Healthineers is one of the highest spenders on R&amp;D, with 2020 expenses exceeding $1.5 billion, which was 9% of the company's total revenue.In the U.S., since universal healthcare does not exist, even a simple procedure can cost tens of thousands of dollars, which in a country where the federal minimum wage is $7.5 an hour, can easily bankrupt someone who doesn't have private insurance. And people who are on the low end of the totem pole in the corporate world or unemployed are more likely not to have insurance. The reason prices are so exorbitant is that insurance companies then haggle with hospitals or healthcare providers to reduce the charges, and a common price is agreed. While this is great news for healthcare companies, and this is why many of them earn hundreds of millions of dollars in profits if not billions, it is not as good for the actual patients, who have the added stress and tension of trying to pay off a bill with savings that they don't have.The presence of technology is ever-increasing in the healthcare industry, and if you're considering which companies have the highest potential for growth, just take a look at the companies increasingly adapting cutting-edge technology to provide innovative solutions in the industry. According to Forbes, the rate of technology adoptions in the healthcare industry increased significantly during the pandemic. More and more hospitals are implementing technological solutions. What seems run of the mill now was once groundbreaking technology, including IV pumps, patient monitors, ventilators and more. Correct implementation of technology will increase efficiency, which in turn means that the benefits of current resources will be maximized and hence, the bottom line will improve. It will be interesting to see in a few years which of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap utilize technology correctly to increase market share and their grip on an extremely profitable industry (see 10 best healthcare dividend stocks to buy).The healthcare segment has various divisions, which includes health insurance, pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare services providers and medical equipment among others. We excluded pharmaceutical companies from our ranking as they would absolutely dominate the list otherwise and claim four out of the top five positions.

To determine the market cap of the largest healthcare companies, we checked their market cap from Yahoo Finance, converting to USD the market cap of companies which were based outside the U.S. Just the 15 largest healthcare companies in the world have a market cap of over $1.1 trillion!

227,8335eb6b-37cf-30b8-8e99-bd474138d50c,ISRG,2022-12-28,"With 85% ownership, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-ownership-intuitive-surgical-inc-130024676.html,1672146024.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TROW']","[A look at the shareholders of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuitive Surgical, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intuitive Surgical. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuitive Surgical's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Intuitive Surgical is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.3%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. holds about 6.9% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$423m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Intuitive Surgical. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Intuitive Surgical better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

228,c0834b19-7535-3c5f-9fc9-75f2823e17eb,WRK,2022-12-28,Investors in Westrock Coffee Company (NASDAQ:WEST) have made a decent return of 31% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-westrock-coffee-company-nasdaq-150007022.html,1672153207,STORY,['WRK'],"[The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). For example, the Westrock Coffee Company, LLC (NASDAQ:WEST) share price is up 31% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market decline of around 24% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! We'll need to follow Westrock Coffee Company for a while to get a better sense of its share price trend, since it hasn't been listed for particularly long.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Westrock Coffee Company Westrock Coffee Company wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.Westrock Coffee Company grew its revenue by 26% last year. That's a fairly respectable growth rate. While the share price performed well, gaining 31% over twelve months, you could argue the revenue growth warranted it. If revenue stays on trend, there may be plenty more share price gains to come. But before deciding this growth stock is underappreciated, you might want to check out profitability trends (and cash flow)The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. You can see what analysts are predicting for Westrock Coffee Company in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWestrock Coffee Company shareholders should be happy with the total gain of 31% over the last twelve months. A substantial portion of that gain has come in the last three months, with the stock up 22% in that time. Demand for the stock from multiple parties is pushing the price higher; it could be that word is getting out about its virtues as a business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

SBH is benefiting from a growing e-commerce business. The beauty products provider benefits from strength in its strategic growth pillars and is undertaking prudent buyouts to fuel growth. However, the company faces escalated cost inflation and supply chain-related issues.Let’s delve deeper.Online Business Aids GrowthSally Beauty is undertaking a number of efforts to augment its robust omnichannel platform. Robust investments to enhance the digital space are yielding. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, global e-commerce sales, at constant currency (cc), rose 30% to $90 million, contributing 9.3% to total consolidated net sales. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that e-commerce has started to comprise a bigger portion of the business as it continues to scale digital capabilities and utilize new tools and resources to fuel customer engagement. Sally Beauty Supply’s (SBS) e-commerce sales at cc grew 20% to $33 million, reflecting 6% of segment net sales. In the Beauty Systems Group (BSG), e-commerce sales at cc jumped 37% to $57 million, contributing 13.9% to the segment’s net sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else is Driving Growth?The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is focused on its four strategic growth pillars to boost the top line. These include leveraging the digital platform, driving loyalty and personalization, undertaking product innovation and enhancing the supply chain. In this regard, the company is making progress in loyalty and personalization. During fiscal 2022, management made several product innovations in the Sally and BSG segments.Beginning in fiscal 2023, Sally Beauty will leverage its omni-channel capabilities and modern retail infrastructure to aid growth. Management is on track to focus on its three key strategic initiatives, which include enhancing customer centricity, growing high-margin-owned brands and carrying out innovations while increasing the efficiency of operations and optimizing its capabilities. Talking about store optimization, management has been piloting store closures in several markets to maximize the value of its large store portfolio and provide a seamless omni-channel experience to its customers.Sally Beauty intends to strengthen its business on the back of strategic acquisitions. In September 2020, Sally Beauty’s subsidiary BSG acquired La Maison Ami-Co Inc. — a professional beauty products distributor in the Canadian province of Quebec. The deal augments its business in Quebec along with increasing the reach of BSG’s professional beauty products in its Chalut store network as well as full-service business.Story continuesIs All Rosy for Sally Beauty?Sally Beauty continued to battle inflationary pressures and supply chain headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share, down from 64 cents in the year-ago quarter. Consolidated net sales of $962.5 million dropped 2.8%. Comparable sales were in line with the year-ago quarter’s levels. The adverse impact of inflationary pressures influencing consumer behavior and supply chain challenges at Beauty Systems Group was a deterrent.In the quarter, Sally Beauty’s consolidated gross profit came in at $463.5 million, down 7.5% from $501 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted gross margin contracted 60 basis points (bps) to 50.1% due to the sales mix shift between Sally Beauty and Beauty Systems Group and increased distribution and freight costs in both units. In fact, management expects the external environment to remain challenging in the future. Certainly, rising inflationary pressure has been altering consumer spending and increasing labor costs.That being said, let’s see if the aforementioned upsides can help SBH counter these hurdles.The company’s stock has gained 2.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 18.1% growth.3 Solid Retail BetsWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, Dillard's, Inc.

The leading off-price retailer’s growth initiatives to enhance offline and online businesses are working favorably.TJX’s stock has increased 27.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 4.4% growth.Let’s discuss this further.Marketing Efforts SolidThe TJX Companies remains committed to boosting growth through effective marketing initiatives and loyalty programs. The company’s aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) are adding growth. To fuel growth, management is on track to attract new shoppers of every age, including many Gen Z and millennial shoppers. Also, its treasure hunt shopping experience is gaining traction among shoppers. The TJX Companies’ gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) have helped improve customer engagement.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else is Working Well?The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been expanding its footprint fast in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia.

The TJX Companies has been witnessing solid demand for an in-person shopping experience in the last few years. Its flexible buying supply chain and store formats aid the company in opening stores across a wide customer demographic.With more consumers resorting to online shopping, the company has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. We believe that The TJX Companies’ off-price model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and efficient supply-chain management are likely to aid its performance. Management is committed to driving traffic and sales in the fiscal fourth quarter. In this regard, it is committed to providing products at great value throughout the store and online. The company expects to deliver an impressive assortment of branded gifts during the holiday season to fuel sales.Story continuesHurdles on the WayThe TJX Companies is grappling with increased freight costs. To some extent, the company’s merchandise margin was hurt by incremental freight pressure in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company also witnessed incremental wage costs, which weighed on the pretax profit margin. The TJX Companies saw additional wage costs of 80 basis points (bps). The company’s fiscal third-quarter gross profit margin was 29.1%, down 0.4 percentage points. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that for modeling purposes, it is currently projecting nearly 130 bps of incremental freight expense and 70 bps of additional wage costs for fiscal 2023.We believe that the upsides mentioned above will likely keep driving The TJX Companies’ growth.Eye These Solid Retail PicksWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks — Dillard's, Inc.

Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2021 Form 10-K and fiscal 2022 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, ma'am. Please go ahead.Photo by Artem Beliaikin on UnsplashBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we will be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, third quarter results were above our expectations as we delivered stronger value throughout our stores. Operating margin for the period was 9.8% versus 11.4% last year, reflecting the deleveraging effect from the comparable sales decline as well as pressure from higher markdowns and unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs.Story continuesEarnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022, were $1 on net income of $342 million. This compares to $1.09 per share or net earnings of $385 million for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021. Total sales for the quarter were $4.6 billion, in line with the prior year, with comparable sales down 3% on top of a robust 14% gain in the third quarter of 2021. The first 9 months earnings per share were $3.08 on net earnings of $1.1 billion, compared to $3.82 per share on net income of $1.4 billion for the same period in 2021. Sales for the year-to-date period totaled $13.5 billion with comparable store sales down 5% versus a strong 14% increase last year. For the third quarter at Ross shoes was the best performing business, while Florida and Texas were the top performing regions as they were bolstered by the outperformance of border and Forex locations.At dd's DISCOUNTS, sales trends improved versus the first half, but continue to trail Ross's results due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are having a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. Inventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of the year with total consolidated inventories at the end of the quarter up 12% compared to last year. Average store inventory during the quarter were up 4% versus 2021 and down compared to pre-pandemic loans. Packaway merchandise represented 41% of the, total compared to 31% last year, when we used packway merchandise to fuel robust sales gains. Turning to store growth. We completed our expansion program for 2022 with the addition of 28 new Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS in the third quarter.For the year, we added a total of 99 locations comprised of 71 Ross and 28 dd's DISCOUNTS. We now expect to end the year with 1,693 Ross stores and 322 dd's DISCOUNTS locations for a net increase of 92 stores. Now, Adam will provide further details on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance.See also 12 Best Affordable Energy Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Aggressive Stocks To Buy Now.Adam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales were down 3% in the quarter. Although traffic improved from the second quarter, it still declined versus the prior year. Partially offsetting these declines was a higher average basket size. Operating margin of 9.8% for the third quarter was down 160 basis points from last year. Cost of goods sold grew by 230 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin declined 165 basis points, primarily due to higher markdowns. Distribution costs were up 140 basis points, mainly due to unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and deleverage from our new distribution center, while occupancy delevered by 20 basis points. These higher expenses were partially offset by a 75 basis point decrease in buying costs, mainly from lower incentives.Lastly, pressure from domestic freight expenses eased in the third quarter and improved 20 basis points as we anniversaried the freight headwinds that began in the second half of last year. SG&amp;A for the period improved by 70 basis points as deleverage from the negative comparable sales was more than offset by lower incentives. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $244 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year. Now, let's discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We continue to expect a very promotional holiday selling season and ongoing inflationary headwinds to pressure our low to moderate-income customers. That said, we face our easiest sales and earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter and are raising our guidance given our third quarter sales momentum and improved holiday assortments.For the 13 weeks ending January 28, 2023, we now expect comparable store sales to be flat to down 2% on top of a 9% gain in the prior year. As a result, earnings per share are forecasted to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.26. The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are projected to be flat to up 3%. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 9.7% to 10.5% versus 9.8% last year. This mainly reflects the anniversarying of significant cost pressures from ocean freight and lower incentives, partially offset by the deleveraging effect from lower same-store sales, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher markdowns. Net interest income is estimated to be about $14 million.Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. And weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 342 million. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are now projected to be in the range of $4.21 to $4.34 compared to $4.87 last year. Now, I will turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.Barbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. Despite the many challenges over the last few years, coupled with today's uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we remain optimistic about our future growth prospects. Our top priority is and always will be delivering fresh and exciting named brand merchandise at compelling discounts every day in our growing store base of over 2,000 locations. With consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience, this bodes well for our ability to expand our market share and profitability in the future. At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:V) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 29.1x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Visa as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Visa peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Visa.Is There Enough Growth For Visa?Visa's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 24%. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 33% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 15% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.3% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why Visa is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Visa's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Story continuesHaving said that, be aware  Visa is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of Visa's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our overview and go directly to the 5 Best Stocks In Each Sector.When it comes to investing in the stock market, having a diversified portfolio certainly does wonders for long-term investors. There is an old adage, ""Don't put all of your eggs in one basket,"" and it is often quoted by legendary investors like Warren Buffett, underscoring the importance of having a diversified portfolio.What is diversification, you may ask? Diversification involves mitigating risk by investing in a variety of relatively less correlated assets/industries. Diversification can greatly help to reduce risk and improve the potential for long-term returns. When it comes to investment in the stock market, diversification can be achieved by investing in a range of stocks from different sectors, industries, and geographic regions.There are several benefits to diversification in stock investing:Risk reduction: By spreading investments across a variety of stocks, the risk of loss is reduced as the performance of one stock is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall portfolio. This is because the returns of different stocks tend to be uncorrelated, meaning they are not influenced by the same factors.Improved returns: While diversification may reduce the risk of loss, it can also potentially lead to improved returns over the long term. This is because a diversified portfolio is more likely to capture the overall performance of the market rather than being reliant on the performance of a single stock or sector.Flexibility: Diversification allows investors to adjust their portfolios to changing market conditions by adding or removing stocks as needed. This flexibility can help investors to capitalize on opportunities and minimize potential losses.Warren Buffett famously made a bet on the S&amp;P500 that the market index would beat the returns generated through active investing by hedge fund managers. To no surprise, Warren Buffett came out as a winner as no hedge fund was able to beat the market from the period of January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017.Story continuesAlthough 2022 was not a good year for the stock market in general, there were certain sectors that generated high returns for investors. Energy stocks, for example, soared as oil and gas prices skyrocketed after the war in Ukraine and the increased global demand.

Bitcoin has cratered over 65%. But gold? It’s up 1.3%. The classic inflation hedge has worked its magic in a wild year for investors, but it wasn’t the strong performance many goldbugs were expecting.The lack of impressive returns has mostly been the result of central banks worldwide hiking interest rates aggressively to fight inflation. Rising rates have increased the value of gold’s competition—the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries—leading prices to stagnate under $2,000 per troy ounce.“What should have been smooth sailing for gold became the perfect storm,” Mobeen Tahir, an investment strategist at WisdomTree, explained in a CNBC interview last week. “A rising U.S. dollar and rising Treasury yields became headwinds for gold.”But in recent weeks, with the strength of the U.S. dollar fading, gold prices have surged to a six-month high. And the precious metal got another boost from China’s decision to further ease its COVID-19 restrictions this week.Gold futures rose roughly 1% to $1,822 per troy ounce on Tuesday after trading as high as $1,838 in the morning hours.Analysts believe gold will see a demand boost as China, the world's largest single market for the metal, reopens. There are also a slew of potential tailwinds for gold heading into next year.If the Federal Reserve pauses or slows the pace of its rate hikes, treasury yields fall, or U.S. economic data deteriorates while inflation remains high, gold will outperform.“These are sort of Goldilocks conditions for gold. Perfect for conditions for gold,” Tahir said.But in the World Gold Council’s 2023 Gold Outlook, analysts said they expect a “a stable but positive performance for gold” next year amid competing headwinds and tailwinds.On one hand, mild recessions tend to bode well for gold, as do a weakening U.S. dollar and rising geopolitical tensions. On the other, inflation is set to fall in 2023, which may lead investors toward riskier assets.Story continues“Lower inflation should mean potentially diminished interest in gold from an inflation-hedging perspective,” the analysts wrote.Higher bond yields have also historically driven investors away from gold, but the World Gold Council’s analysts said they believe yields aren’t high enough to hurt prices significantly.“Although higher bond yields are associated with lower gold returns and might now be deemed attractive by some investors, current yield levels are historically not a hindrance to gold doing well, particularly when accounting for a weaker U.S. dollar,” they wrote.For investors, WisdomTree’s Tahir noted, it’s important to remember that “every gold rally has a silver lining.”“We may see a lot of investors express their bullish view on gold via silver next year,” he said, noting that the two precious metals often move in tandem, with silver commonly seeing better returns.Silver prices rose nearly 1.5% on Tuesday and are up roughly 15% over the past month.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches—living with mom and dadMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

The real slid 1.0% against a rebounding dollar . Central bank data showed borrowing costs in bank loans in Brazil rose in November to the highest level in more than five years, while default ratios continued to grow, under the effects of an aggressive monetary tightening cycle to tame inflation. Meanwhile, Brazil's sovereign floating rate bond redemptions will hit a record high next year, underscoring the fiscal challenge facing President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as he raises the spending ceiling to fund a social welfare package. The real has been the best performing currency in the region, up 5.7% so far this year. Financial markets had been expecting the central bank's benchmark rate - currently at 13.75% - to fall in March but they have started to price in a rate hike since Lula presented his social package, which bypasses the constitutional spending cap and which Congress approved last week. ""The peak of CPI inflation is past us, disinflation is in progress, however the risks are present, specially from the fiscal fundamentals,"" said analysts at Rabobank in a note.

The deaths threaten to keep anger fired up despite a lull in violence over the festive period in the heavily Catholic country.The clashes with the Dec. 7 ouster of former president Pedro Castillo after he tried to illegally dissolve Congress to avoid an impeachment vote he feared losing. He was voted out of office shortly after and arrested for alleged ""rebellion"". He denies the charges.His arrest triggered an outpouring of anger at the country's political elite and Congress, widely reviled as corrupt and self-serving, especially in Peru's poor southern mining regions where rising food and energy costs have hit people hard.As new President Dina Boluarte tried to stem the protests, which saw blockades of highways, buildings set on fire and airports invaded, the government declared a nationwide state of emergency on Dec. 14, curtailing some civic rights and allowing the armed forces to support the police maintaining public order.A day later on Dec. 15 protesters in Ayacucho invaded the runway of the regional airport, a block away from Prado's garage, where he lived and worked on Calle Los Angeles, which ran parallel to the airstrip. The airport was forced to suspend flights.The army was sent in to wrest back control.Story continuesA security camera near the airport shows protesters invading the runway around 2 p.m., some throwing rocks and burning tires while troops gathered. Military helicopters circled above. The public ombudsman said gas grenades were thrown onto protesters below.By 5 p.m. the violence spread outside the limits of the airport, and the shooting in the streets began. By the end of the night the clashes would leave 10 people dead or fatally wounded. The most recent died on Dec. 21.At 5.55 p.m., security camera footage from a store on Calle Los Angeles opposite Prado's home shows a group of protesters and others standing in the street.The crowd is suddenly startled by something off camera and starts running. On the sidewalk on the far side of the road a person falls and lies still. A group of people come to check on the person, including Edgar who is seen walking the opposite way from the crowd and seemingly out of the entrance to his home. He kneels over the person and stays with them while others run off.A minute later the footage shows Edgar is shot and collapses. He died the next morning on Dec. 16 from hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock, pulmonary and hepatic lacerations, and open chest trauma caused by a gunshot to the chest, according to his autopsy.""The military is supposedly trained to fight terrorism, not take the lives of our residents,"" his sister Edith told Reuters, adding that he had not been involved in the protests. ""He was basically murdered by the military.""She said Edgar left the house he shares with her after gunfire hit their gate and he saw protesters being hurt, a narrative that appears to tally with footage seen by Reuters. She showed Reuters bullet casings and marks on the door frame.""The only thing I want is justice for my brother.""LETHAL FORCE A 'LAST RESORT'The military say they had come under serious attack, which gave them cause to respond with force.At 1 p.m. on Dec. 15 a military unit that was heading from the town center to the Ayacucho airport was attacked by a crowd with ""blunt objects, explosives and handmade firearms"", the armed forced said in a statement a day after.This, the army said, put the troop's ""physical integrity at risk"" and that they acted within ""established legal procedure, strictly applying current norms regarding the use of force"".Peru's military regulations say that in a state of emergency, members of the armed forces can use firearms ""in self defense or defense of other people, in the case of imminent risk of death or severe injury, or to avoid particularly dangerous crimes that pose a threat to life.""It also says use of lethal force should be a ""last resort"".Reuters made repeated attempts to interview Peruvian police and military leaders by phone and in person. A reporter went to the military base in Ayacucho to speak to the local general in charge of operations, but was denied access.The United Nations has called for investigations into child casualties in the protests. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has condemned violence by both security forces and protesters and called for dialogue.The deaths have become a lightning rod for anger in poor Andean and Amazonian areas, when many feel overlooked despite local oil and copper wealth. Many want major political change and constitutional reform.""They aimed bullets of war at our brothers,"" said Rocio Leandro Melgar, a protest leader in Ayacucho, who blamed the government for allowing the violence to happen.""We'll keep moving forward, things can't stay like this.""'GUNFIRE EVERYWHERE'Other footage from a security camera at a parking garage near the airport shared with Reuters shows a man standing next to a building looking up the road. Something strikes his arm and he runs to hide behind a tree.A few seconds later a second man is seen running through the tree-lined plaza opposite. The person runs across the road towards the parking garage camera and suddenly falls to the ground still. The owner of the parking garage said the person died.Multiple residents in the same neighborhood surrounding the airport said sporadic gunfire continued well into the night.Edith Aguilar says her son, Jose Luis, 20, was working at a local soft drinks factory until 6.30 p.m. on the day of the protests and was killed on his way home from work. Autopsy reports shared with Reuters show he died from severe head trauma from a gunshot.""There was gunfire everywhere,"" Aguilar, who lives in the area around the airport said. ""You couldn't even go outside.""Aguilar said her sister-in-law called her asking whether her son had made it home. She had seen him walking in the street earlier and had heard someone matching his description had been killed.""My son was coming back from work,"" Aguilar said. ""It's a lie, those people who say we're terrorists.""The most recent fatality, 19-year-old Jhonathan Alarcon, died from internal bleeding on Dec. 21, a week after he was shot in the hip during the Ayacucho protests, according to his aunt who spoke to Reuters and data from Peru's ombudsman.In an act of protest, his family on Dec. 22 took his coffin to the plaza where he was shot, laying it on the ground while a band played music. One mourner shouted protest slogans from a megaphone underneath a big red banner commemorating the victims of what it called a ""massacre"".""They didn't need to shoot like that,"" Luzmila Alarcon, Jhonathan's aunt who also attended the protest, told Reuters at his memorial service. ""It looked like a clash between soldiers, but it was citizens versus the military.""She said the deaths would spur more anger as people looked to find someone to hold accountable.""It can't be possible that no government or no authority takes responsibility for this,"" she said. ""They weren't stray bullets or accidents. They were direct shots by the military ... This isn't the way to calm the population.""(Reporting by Alexander Villegas; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Daniel Wallis)]"

Despite recent setbacks in Peru and Argentina, left-wing governments in the region rule at the highest rate in over two decades, in what has come to be known as the second “pink tide.”A resurgence of the far-left surge of the late 1990s, newly-elected leaders across the region have prioritized environmental issues, blaming neoliberal policies for fueling the climate crisis and contributing to worsening inequality.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureAfter victories in the five largest economies in Latin America, the left-wing governments have the chance to enact meaningful forestry, agricultural, and energy reforms over the course of next year and beyond. Here’s a look at their plans, and the challenges they face.Charted: Latin America’s pink tidedatawrapper-chart-Fm30iSeeing the Amazon forest for the treesSince the onset of his presidential campaign, Lula has stressed the importance of reversing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, pledging to undo the environmental destruction seen under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.Lula was largely successful at turning the tide of deforestation during his previous term as president, cracking down on illegal logging and creating new methods to track forest loss. In 2004, the year after he took office, the Amazon lost 7 million acres of trees. By 2012, a year after the end of his tenure, the annual losses were down to 1.1 million acres. That number rose precipitously after the new Bolsonaro administration weakened a number of laws regulating loggers and agricultural businesses. During his first three years in office, the Amazon lost 8.4 million acres, a 52% increase over the previous three-year period. As the world’s largest carbon sink, preserving and repopulating rainforests like the Amazon is essential to achieving the climate goals of the Paris agreement.Story continuesLula has argued that Brazil can remain a major agricultural producer without needing to clear another acre of rainforest, pledging to eventually reach zero deforestation in the Amazon. To get there, Lula will have to work with a hostile congress and weakened environmental institutions.Mexico’s saying no to GMOIn 2021, Mexico’s president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as AMLO) announced plans to phase out imports of genetically-modified corn by 2024, excluding production meant for livestock. AMLO campaigned on a promise to ban genetically-modified crops in Mexico, deeming them detrimental to traditional agricultural practices and possibly hazardous to human health. He has stated that the ban on corn is a first step towards promoting organic, regenerative agriculture in Mexico.An unprecedented decision in the Americas, US farmers have repeatedly claimed that this trade restriction breaks the USMCA, the free trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the US. While open to negotiations, the Mexican government has stated its intention to protect itself in a possible trade dispute with the US and Canada, an already tenuous relationship after a recent disagreement over Mexico’s nationalized energy sources.AMLO has also pushed for a ban on the common herbicide glysophate, a key ingredient in Monsanto’s popular weedkiller, that has been linked to cancer. Colombia, where glysophate has been sprayed over coca plantations as part of the country’s war on drugs, imposed a ban on the substance in 2015, a decision that turned into a long court battle. The country’s newly elected leftist president Gustavo Petro plans to expand this ban as he rethinks Colombia’s approach to the war on drugs, including proposals to decriminalize cocaine and end all aerial spraying of coco plants.The environmental degradation caused by illegal mining practices in the Madre De Dios province of Peru.Canary in the metal minesPedro Castillo’s ousting earlier this month put an abrupt end to his term as Peru’s first indigenous president, and spurred a series of fervent protests in the rural, poor communities that made up much of his support. Castillo’s supporters accuse multinational corporations and establishment politicians of sabotaging the socialist leader, while his opponents say he was a destabilizing figure and a threat to democracy.The demonstrations have been largely concentrated in mining communities around the country, where poor, mostly indigenous workers are employed by foreign companies for low wages. Castillo promised aggressive mining reforms during his campaign and supported a number of strikes and blockades during his time in office. One of the world’s largest exporters of copper and gold, Peru is also one of the poorest and most unequal countries in Latin America.Next door in Chile, the government of left-wing president Gabriel Boric campaigned on an aggressive overhaul to the tax code focused on foreign mining companies. Recently, the Chilean government floated a 1% increase on copper mining royalties for any company that produces more than 50,000 tons per year, and a 4% increase for companies with production over 200,000 tons, with all new revenue redirected to newly-enacted social welfare programs.In response, a number of mining companies have threatened to pull out their investments, while Boric has repeatedly vowed to pass aggressive environmental regulations in the industry and create a state-owned lithium company.Venezuela only talks the talkPresident Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela struck a forceful tone at the COP27 conference in November, denouncing the extraction of natural resources in service of unrestrained capitalism as the root cause of climate change. “The cause [of climate change] is the dream of seeking to find happiness in accumulating possessions,” Maduro said, quoting his political mentor and predecessor Hugo Chávez. “People think they have a right to grab and own and destroy anything that stands in their way to accumulating capital.”Missing from the speech? Any mention of Venezuela’s current oil industry, which produces more than 2 million barrels of oil each day. Once the richest economy in South America, the petrostate is still among the largest exporters of oil in the world, even after a series of strict sanctions on the industry were imposed by the US and other Western nations in recent years.Additionally, Venezuela has the fastest-growing rate of deforestation in Latin America. This is mainly due to Maduro’s 2016 decision to open up the massive Orinoco region bordering the Brazilian Amazon for the mining of gold and other valuable minerals. Reports from the region include gang warfare, heavily polluted rivers, and a largely avoidable malaria epidemic.Venezuela’s poor environmental record notwithstanding, the US has recently opened up to reconsider part of the sanctions imposed on the country under the Trump administration in a bid to compensate for the sanctions-hit Russian crude. As Venezuela faces a series of political, economic, and social challenges, it looks like environmental progress will be put on the back burner.Related Stories:🪓 Brazil is failing to stop illegal logging of the Amazon💊 In Colombia, women’s health paid the price of misguided drug control policies🛢️ The Tienditas bridge serves as a powerful symbol of improving ties between Venezuela and ColombiaMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Dividend Stocks Paying Over 6%. Market volatility, growing fears of recession heading into 2023, and rising concerns about the global economic outlook have investors fleeing from growth equities into value and dividend plays to defend their portfolios, in order to benefit from upside potential. Investors with long-term horizons and low risk appetites usually pile into dividend-paying stocks, which have historically proven to be effective hedges against inflation. According to Morgan Stanley, high yielding dividend stocks outpaced the broader market largely in 2021 and 2022, partly due to energy stocks, as the accelerating price of oil boosted energy firms’ cash stockpiles. Similarly, the packaged food sector has dividends with a stable growth outlook, supported by resilient demand and high margins, in addition to solid cash flow to pay debts and make consistent payouts to shareholders. Regulated electric and gas utilities have mature businesses and analysts expect dividend growth of 6% annually through 2024 in the sector. Furthermore, despite credit losses rising in a recession scenario, banks could raise their dividends by up to 36% year-over-year in 2023 as per Morgan Stanley. A look at the returns of the S&amp;P 500 Index stocks over the last 50 years indicates that firms with increasing free cash flow and dividends have outperformed over the long-term and experience lesser volatility compared to non-dividend payers or dividend slashers. Investors are always on the hunt for dividend stocks which offer growth potential and stability (see 12 Best Performing Dividend Stocks) to navigate the turbulent markets. Popular American television personality Jim Cramer, who frequently analyzes Wall Street equities on his show Mad Money on CNBC, also recently backed dividend stocks which have a history of consecutively growing dividend payouts over the years.

We believe the market has undervalued its enduring competitive advantage due to its low cost iron and copper mining operations which has allowed the company to deliver consistent profits and cash flows across the inevitable ups and downs of the global metals cycle. While the variability of commodity prices prevents BHP from scoring in the top ranks of measured quality, we are willing to bear some of that uncertainty in return for a more attractive valuation given the company’s strong business fundamentals.”8.

They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”6. Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Dividend Yield as of December 27: 8.79%Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) was founded in 1942 and is headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

As of December 27, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)’s dividend yield came in at 8.79%, making it one of the best dividend stocks to monitor. On December 9, Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba upgraded Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) to Overweight from Equal Weight and raised the price target to $20 from $14.50. China's reopening will continue to benefit miners, but the path forward will be ""bumpy,"" the analyst told investors in a research note. He sees iron ore price momentum heading into the first half of 2023, which is supported by lower supply and China winding down its COVID Zero policy. Additionally, share catalysts for a re-rating include a potential transaction that would ""unlock value"" from Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)’s base metals unit, contended the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 27 hedge funds were long Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), and William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 20.7 million shares worth $276 million. In addition to AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:VALE) is one of the top dividend stocks to invest in according to smart investors. Here is what GMO LLC had to say about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at Vale (NYSE:VALE), the world’s largest iron ore producer, as a case study for how shareholders can be rewarded. Vale’s stock price is about where it was at the beginning of last year. Despite the market’s lack of enthusiasm, the company generated about $20 billion of free cash flow last year. Not bad for a company with a market cap of a little over $100 billion and no substantive debt as of the end of March. 4 What did the company do with all that cash? Last year, Vale paid out about $9 billion in regularly scheduled dividends and distributed another $10 billion between extra dividends and share repurchases. Combined with dividends distributed in the first quarter of this year and a recently announced share repurchase, Vale has returned or announced the return of over $33 billion since the beginning of last year, almost a 32% yield relative to the market cap of the company. Not a bad way to win.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Stocks Paying Over 6%.    Suggested articles:10 Jim Cramer Stock Picks This Week17 Biggest Energy Companies in the US12 Biggest Metaverse Companies in the World Disclosure: None. 11 Best Dividend Stocks Paying Over 6% is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(VZ) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-trending-140002608.html,1672063202,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -1.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has lost 4.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.18 points to a change of -3.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.05 indicates a change of -2.6% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $35.15 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.2%. The $136.75 billion and $139.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.4% and +1.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $34.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +3.13%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Q3 revenue was $5.93 billion, down 12% sequentially and down 17% year-on-year. We delivered record data center and automotive revenue, while our gaming and pro visualization platforms declined as we work through channel inventory corrections and challenging external conditions. Starting with data center. Revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially and 31% year-on-year. This reflects very solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges, new export controls and lingering supply chain disruptions. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by leading U.S. cloud providers and a broadening set of consumer internet companies for workloads such as large language models, recommendation systems and generative AI.As the number and scale of public cloud computing and internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases. We will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly. Other vertical industries, such as automotive and energy, also contributed to growth with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations and analytics. During the quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H100 based products to China, and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China.That said, demand in China more broadly remains soft, and we expect that to continue in the current quarter. We started shipping our flagship H100 data center GPU based on the new Hopper architecture in Q3. H100-based systems are available starting this month from leading server makers including Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro. Early next year, the first H100 based cloud instances will be available on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. H100 delivered the highest performance and workload versatility for both, AI training and inference in the latest MLPerf industry benchmarks. H100 also delivers incredible value compared to the previous generation for equivalent AI performance it offers 3x lower total cost of ownership while using 5x fewer server nodes and 3.5x less energy.Earlier today, we announced a multiyear collaboration with Microsoft to build an advanced cloud-based AI supercomputer to help enterprises train, deploy and scale AI including large state-of-the-art models. Microsoft Azure will incorporate our complete AI stack, adding tens and thousands of A100 and H100 GPUs, Quantum-2 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking and the NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite to its platform. Oracle and NVIDIA are also working together to offer AI training and inference at scale to thousands of enterprises. This includes bringing to Oracle cloud infrastructure the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack and adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and H100. Cloud-based high-performance is adopting NVIDIA AI enterprise and other software to address the industrial scientific communities' rising demand for AI in the cloud.NVIDIA AI will bring new capability to rescale high-performance computing as a service offerings, which include simulation and engineering software used across industries. Networking posted strong growth driven by hyperscale customers and easing supply constraints. Our new Quantum-2 40 gigabit per second InfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet networking platforms are building momentum. We achieved an important milestone this quarter with VMware, whose leading server virtualization platform, vSphere, has been rearchitected over the last two years to run on DPUs and now supports our BlueField DPUs. Our joint enterprise AI platform is available first on Dell PowerEdge servers. The BlueField DPU design win pipeline is growing and the number of infrastructure software partners is expanding, including Arista, Check Point, Juniper, Palo Alto Networks and Red Hat.The latest top 500 list of supercomputers released this week at Supercomputing 22 has the highest ever number of NVIDIA-powered systems, including 72% of the total and 90% of new systems on the list. Moreover, NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 of the Green500 list, demonstrating the energy efficiency of accelerated computing. The number one most energy-efficient system is the Flatiron Institute's Henry, which is the first top 500 system featuring our H100 GPUs. At GTC, we announced the NVIDIA Omniverse Computing System, or OVX, reference designed featuring the new L40 GPU based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. These systems are designed to build and operate 3D virtual worlds using NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise. NVIDIA OVX systems will be available from Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro by early 2023.Lockheed Martin and Jaguar Land Rover will be among the first customers to receive OVX systems. We are further expanding our AI software and services offerings with NVIDIA and BioNeMo large language model services, which are both entering early access this month. These enable developers to easily adopt large language models and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, tech summarization, chatbox, co-development, protein structure and biomolecular property predictions. Moving to gaming. Revenue of $1.57 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 51% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations. We believe Channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit Q4.Sell-through for our gaming products was relatively solid in the Americas and EMEA, but softer in Asia Pac as macroeconomic conditions and COVID lockdowns in China continued to weigh on consumer demand. Our new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture had an exceptional launch. The first Ada GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090 became available in mid-October and a tremendous amount and positive feedback from the gaming community. We sold out quickly in many locations and are working hard to keep up with demand. The next member of the Ada family, RTX 4080 is available today. The RTX 40 series GPUs features DLSS 3, the neural rendering technology that uses AI to generate entire frames for faster game play. Our third-generation RTX technology has raised the bar for computer graphics and helped supercharge gaming.For example, the 15-year old classic game Portal -- now reimagined with full ray tracing and DLSS 3 has made it on Steam's top 100 most wish-listed gains. The total number of RTX games and applications now exceeds 350. There is tremendous energy in the gaming community that we believe will continue to fuel strong fundamentals over the long term. The number of simultaneous users on Steam just hit a record of 30 million, surpassing the prior peak of 28 million in January. Activision's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 set a record for the franchise with more than $800 million in opening weekend sales, topping the combined box office openings of movie blockbusters, Top Gun: Maverick; and Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. And this month's League of Legends World Championship in San Francisco sold out in minutes with 18,000 Esports fans packed the arena where the Golden State Warriors play.We continue to expand the GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. In Q3, we added over 85 games to the library, bringing the total to over 1,400. We also launched GeForce NOW on the new gaming devices, including Logitech, Cloud G, handheld, cloud gaming Chromebooks and Razr 5G Edge. Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $200 million was down 60% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations. These dynamics are expected to continue in Q4. Despite near-term challenges, we believe our long-term opportunity remains intact, fueled by AI, simulation, computationally intensive design and engineering workloads. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Services, our first software and infrastructure as a service offering, enabling artists, developers and enterprise teams to design, publish and operate metaverse applications from anywhere on any device.Omniverse Cloud Services runs on Omniverse cloud computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OVX for graphics and physics simulation. NVIDIA HDX for AI workloads and the NVIDIA graphics delivery network, a global scale distributed data center network for delivering low-latency metaverse graphics on the edge. Leaders in some of the world's largest industries continue to adopt Omniverse. Home improvement retailer, Lowe's is using it to help design, build and operate digital twins for their stores. Charter Communications and advanced analytics company, HEAVY.AI are creating Omniverse power digital twins to optimize Charter's wireless network. And Deutsche Bahn, operator of German National Railway is using Omniverse to create digital twins of its rail network and train AI models to monitor the network, increasing safety and reliability.See also 15 Biggest Dry Bulk Shipping Companies in 2022 and 20 Companies That Sponsor H1B Visas.Moving to automotive. Revenue of $251 million increased 14% sequentially and 86% from a year ago. Growth was driven by an increase in AI automotive solutions as our customers' DRIVE Orin-based production ramps continue to scale. Automotive has great momentum and is on its way to be our next multibillion-dollar platform. Volvo Cars unveiled the all-new flagship Volvo EX90 SUV powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. This is the first model to use Volvo's software-defined architecture with a centralized core computer containing both, DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Xavier, along with 30 sensors. Other recently announced design wins and new model introductions include Hozon Auto, NIO, Polestar and XPeng. At GTC, we also announced that NVIDIA DRIVE Thor Superchip, the successor to Orin in our automotive SoC roadmap.DRIVE Thor delivers up to 2,000 teraFLOPS of performance and leverages technologies introduced in our Grace Hopper and Ada architectures. It is capable of running both the automated drive and in-vehicle infotainment systems, simultaneously offering a leap of performance while reducing cost and energy consumption. DRIVE Thor will be available for automakers 2025 models with Geely-owned automaker ZEEKR as the first announced customer. Moving to the rest of the P&amp;L. GAAP gross margins was 53.6% and non-GAAP gross margins was 56.1%. Gross margins reflect $702 million in inventory charges largely related to lower data center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million. Year-on-year, GAAP operating expenses were up 31%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 30%, primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to headcount growth and salary increases and higher data center infrastructure expenses.Sequentially, both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense growth was in the single-digit percent, and we plan to keep it relatively flat at these levels over the coming quarters. We returned $3.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 23. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect our data center revenue to reflect early production shipments of the H100, offset by continued softness in China. In gaming, we expect to resume sequential growth with our revenue still below end demand as we continue to work through the channel inventory correction. And in automotive, we expect the continued ramp of our Orin design wins.All-in, we expect modest sequential growth driven by automotive, gaming and data center. Revenue is expected to be $6 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be $63.2 million and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.56 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million to $550 million.Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be attending the Credit Suisse Conference in Phoenix on November 30th, the Arete Virtual Tech Conference on December 5th, and the JPMorgan Forum on January 5th in Las Vegas. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 are scheduled for Wednesday, February 22. We will now open the call for questions.

Here to break it down is Futurum Research principal analyst Daniel Newman. Daniel, so we saw Micron claiming its inventories are now well above target levels. What exactly happened here with this chip glut?DANIEL NEWMAN: Well, just like we ended up in a shortage, nobody really expected so much demand to come on so quickly. And chipmakers weren't able to ramp up the inventory quickly enough. And so as that demand kind of swelled and stayed intact for more than a year following the initial pandemic, as people bought cars, gaming consoles, PC, servers in the data center, the same thing happened on the way down. We saw what happened with the Fed.We raised rates. We see we're heading into a recession. Discretionary income is down. People's balance sheets at home are not as good as they were. And all of a sudden, all these companies that ramped up have all this extra inventory. And effectively, we don't have the demand we had. And so now the inventory is there, and prices are coming down, and chipmakers are hurting.SEANA SMITH: And Daniel, we certainly have seen a number of chip makers respond and start to shift their operations or how they're approaching business over the coming quarters. Micron cutting 10% of its workforce as that demand drops. When it comes to these inventory levels, the fact that they are so swelled at this point, how long until those inventory levels, I guess, get to more appropriate or what is, I guess, considered a historic norm?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, we're hearing different things from different leaders in these companies. We've heard from Nvidia's leadership that it should be some time at the end of this quarter, which, for them, ends in January. We heard Sanjay Mehrotra of Micron say probably in the second half of this year. I think some of the specificity is going to go around, whether are they data center chips, are they automotive chips, are they gaming consoles, are they PCs.Story continuesEach of these have their own sort of boom and bust cycles, but of course, we're seeing sort of an overall bust cycle right now. I like the chip companies that are more centric to things like cloud data center and automotive. And those that are really heavily into gaming and PC, I think a lot of their demand got pulled forward. And you could see it a longer time. So that's why Mehrotra said second half of this year, Nvidia's gaming chips, parts of Intel and AMD, they're probably looking at second half or later before they really start to see normal demand come back.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Daniel, so I covered the auto sector. And we're still seeing a lot of the chip crunch happening there across a number of automakers. You mentioned that it's specific to different sectors. What is it about these chips that the auto sector needs is just-- is not-- the industry is not actually pumping out enough of them?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, it's really interesting. The automotive sector depends a lot on these lagging edge semiconductors, which is 14 nanometer and above. These are often produced by the likes of Tower Semiconductors, GlobalFoundries. A lot of what we're hearing, the resiliency, the fabs being built are more of these newer leading edge. These are the 5 and 7 nanometer process.So what's happened is we have all this demand peaking for automotive. You've got cars now that have more semiconductors in them than ever before, but we haven't really increased the production of capabilities like we're doing, and we haven't finished yet, but on a lot of these leading edge with the CHIPS Act. So we don't have the production capabilities to kind of get up to all this demand we had for automotive. And so we're still seeing car prices are still pretty high. Used car demand is still a little bit swelled. And all these chip makers are going to need to keep ramping up production to ever catch up on these automotive designs that are semiconductor intensive.SEANA SMITH: Daniel, we heard from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger back in October. And he said, quote, ""It's just hard to see any points of good news on the horizon."" We know that Intel then issued a muted outlook. They also announced job cuts. Do you see is there any reason to be optimistic about this sector heading into the new year?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, if you zoom out overall, it's really hard to see a world that isn't going to be accelerated by technology, whether that's supercomputing in AI. Whether that's the next generation of vehicles, data centers and the cloud, and the software that enterprises run to operate, all these things require semiconductors. Over the next 12 months, during a tight recessionary period, I believe companies are going to try to do more with what they have technology wise, which means less buying of PCs and servers, which means a tougher outlook in the short-term.But in the long run, the amount of software, the digitalization of everything means more semiconductors. You really got to follow those boom and bust cycles. We are in a bust cycle that was accelerated by a crazy boom. But the semiconductor tends to run pretty closely with those economic up and downs. I think as we start to come out of this economic downturn, you'll see the semiconductor volume pick up in a big way, as it's going to be critical to the advancement of our infrastructure and of business.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Daniel, so do you think that the CHIPS Act will kind of help that boom-bust, smooth it out a bit more? And who can really actually benefit in terms of the companies from that act?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, some of this demand planning, the supply chain issues that we have, the hyperdependency we've created with Taiwan, I mean, we definitely put ourselves in a bit of a difficult situation. We, of course, have great relations with Taiwan, but there's a lot of microaggression going on with China that's creating some discomfort. We've got some new tariffs and some new regulatory policy going against certain chips shipping over to China.We need to bring more production here to the United States. We need to bring more production on the leading edge. We need to bring more, as I mentioned with automotive, on some of those lagging, older process technologies, 14 nanometer and above. I think Intel has got the biggest opportunity to benefit. But we're seeing Micron, IBM. I mean, TSMC is reaching out for money. And all the fabless companies can benefit from some of the dollars that are there for innovation, R&amp;D, and design in the extension of the CHIPS and Sciences Act.But I like Intel's prospects. If they can get policymakers behind them, this could be a good moment for Intel. But of course, TSMC has had so much success. It'll be interesting to see does our government back the Taiwanese manufacturer to do more leading edge here, or does more dollars go to Intel, which may be a good idea for the national security and resiliency that we are needing in the future.SEANA SMITH: Certainly a number of stories to keep an eye on when it comes to the chip sector in 2020. Daniel Newman, as always, thanks so much for joining us here this afternoon.]"

However, the company’s opioid-related litigation expenses pose a threat.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have gained 54.4% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 11.9%. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 20.6% in the same time frame.McKesson — with a market capitalization of $54.4 billion — is a healthcare services and information technology company. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 10.1% over the next five years. The company beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed twice, the average surprise being 4.79%. Its earnings yield of 6.5% also compares favorably with the industry’s 4.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring It?McKesson continues to actively pursue deals, divestitures and acquisitions to drive growth. In April 2022, the company completed the divestiture of its retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom to Aurelius. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, the company completed the sale of its Austrian business to Quadrifolia management and the remaining share of its German joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance. McKesson is currently progressing with the divestiture of its European business. These divestitures will allow the company to focus on its key growth market — the United States.In June, McKesson formed a joint venture with HCA Healthcare HCA to create a fully integrated oncology research organization. Per the deal, McKesson and HCA will integrate their respective research units, US Oncology Research (USOR) and Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI). The newly created entity, with the combined capabilities of SCRI and USOR, is expected to boost clinical research, ramp up the development of drugs, lead to better data and analytic capabilities, and pave the way for a wider portfolio of clinical trials. The deal between McKesson and HCA was completed in October.Story continuesMcKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses, and stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics, courtesy of several patent expirations in the next few years, and an aging population.During the fiscal second quarter of 2023, McKesson’s growth was led by its strong performance across all segments, except the International segment, which was marred by unfavorable currency movement. The divestiture of McKesson’s Austrian business also hurt its growth.The company removed a major overhang during the fiscal first quarter by signing a settlement agreement related to the opioid-related claims of all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories. These developments will close the long-pending litigations that have been hurting the company’s goodwill, while also reducing legal expenses.McKesson’s agreements with the U.S. government for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting and storage programs and COVID-19 tests proved beneficial.What’s Hurting the Stock?McKesson’s broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities is likely to drive expenses for the company in the short term. The company had to pay up to approximately $7.4 billion to the Settling Governmental Entities, per the settlement agreement.Estimates Trend  For fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $275.4 billion, suggesting an improvement of 4.3% from the year-ago period’s reported figure. The same for adjusted earnings per share stands at $24.78, suggesting growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.McKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation price | McKesson Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV and Merit Medical Systems MMSI, carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

265,e6da902f-5ea3-3a8e-a49f-59a0613208a1,MCK,2022-12-28,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of McKesson Europe AG (HMSE:CLS1),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-mckesson-europe-095247148.html,1672134767,STORY,['MCK'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of McKesson Europe AG (HMSE:CLS1) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for McKesson Europe Is McKesson Europe Fairly Valued?We have to calculate the value of McKesson Europe slightly differently to other stocks because it is a healthcare company. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (0.03%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 4.5%. Relative to the current share price of €20.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= €0.8 / (4.5% – 0.03%)= €18.6dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McKesson Europe as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 4.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Story continuesSWOT Analysis for McKesson EuropeStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.Current share price is above our estimate of fair value.OpportunityHas sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Lack of analyst coverage makes it difficult to determine CLS1's earnings prospects.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals How Fast Is Air Products and Chemicals Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Air Products and Chemicals grew its EPS by 8.2% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While Air Products and Chemicals did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. If EBIT margins are able to stay balanced and this revenue growth continues, then we should see brighter days ahead.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

What's going on there with that?ALLIE CANAL: Well, with ""Avatar,"" it was better than opening weekend. We saw opening weekend for ""Avatar"" miss expectations there. But the film secured an additional 95.5 million domestically. As that global total nears the coveted $1 billion mark, box office analysts are very encouraged by these numbers, especially since we had very severe winter storms throughout the United States that likely impacted theatrical attendance overall. Now all that being said, ""The Way of Water"" likely will not be the number one movie of 2022. That is going to go to ""Top Gun, Maverick,"" which has secured $1.4 billion globally.Also ""Jurassic World Dominion,"" that had a $1 billion haul worldwide. So we will see if this ""Avatar"" sequel can eclipse that number. But box office watchers are really focused on that slow burn through the holiday week into 2023. There's not that much competition. The next big blockbuster is the third iteration of the Ant-Man franchise, which is expected on February 17.But also on premium formats, the ""Avatar"" sequel has performed very well. IMAX shares closing the day up 3.3% today after the company announced that the sequel had earned $105.5 million in IMAX global box office in less than two weeks. And that's the fastest film to hit that $100 million milestone for IMAX since April 2019. So it seems like what people have been saying, what analysts have been saying, that you have to play the long game with the ""Avatar"" sequel, that could be true. But we'll see what 2023 brings.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: We talked about James Cameron, that long burn, that slow burn. He's been known for that. So we'll see with ""Avatar.""ALLIE CANAL: He's number one.

276,903d5081-5f3c-308c-9792-9b61f7676cc8,DIS,2022-12-28,30 Highest Grossing Movies of All Time Adjusted for Inflation,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-highest-grossing-movies-time-162231238.html,1672158151,STORY,['DIS'],"[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 30 Highest Grossing Movies of All Time Adjusted For Inflation. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 10 Highest Grossing Movies of All Time Adjusted for Inflation.Streaming had been emerging as the preferred form of entertainment consumption even before the pandemic, thanks to the success of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Because of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), most people could access most movies, TV shows, documentaries and stand-up shows in one location, paying a reasonable fee each month. Streaming allows people to watch shows whenever they want, and led to the term binge-watching, where people could watch an entire season in one sitting rather than having to wait a week for a single episode.When the pandemic hit and people were locked in their homes and movie theaters were shuttered down completely, a new audience realized the comfort of watching movies from the comfort of their beds, without having to pay exorbitant rates for overpriced snacks and drinks, and then missing part of the movie having to go to the toilet. Statistics back this argument as well: according to The Dartmouth, 28% of people strongly preferred to watch a movie in a movie theater for the first time, while just 15% preferred to stream it. In June 2020, when the pandemic was at an early peak, the percentage of people who preferred to go the movie theater dropped to just 14% while 36% preferred to stream movies. This shows a shifting trend in people's preferences and means that the movie industry is at a crossroads. Based on these statistics, it looks like largest media companies which have a strong future and are more likely for stronger growth, and hence, are a good option to invest in, are those companies which recognize this switch and adapt accordingly.30 Highest Grossing Movies of All Time Adjusted For InflationBillion Photos/Shutterstock.comTake The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) for example. The company is home to one of the biggest film studios in the world in Walt Disney Studios, which includes many other major film studios such as Lucasfilm, Pixar, 20th Century Animation, 20th Century Studios, Marvel Studios and Searchlight Pictures. Despite the size and earnings of Walt Disney Studios, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has realized that only creating and releasing movies in the traditional method is not sustainable in the long run and diversification is needed. Hence, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) created Disney+, a subscription video on-demand streaming services. While the subscription service primarily provides access to TV shows and movies created by Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Television, there are content hubs for different brands including the aforementioned Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. While Disney initially had a streaming deal with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), it has seen massive success for Disney+, with more than 162 million subscribers right now. This shows that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is well-positioned to take advantage of customer's changing preferences which could usher in a new era of growth for the company.Story continuesYou would think that the film studios with the highest grossing movies of all time adjusted for inflation would also attract the most investors. However, whatever amount a movie grosses represents only the revenue it earns and it doesn't represent net profit or return on investment. In fact, if you were considering the most profitable movies of all time, some of the highest grossing movies of all time wouldn't even come anywhere near, despite earning billions in the box office. For example, The Blair Witch Project, one of the most popular budget horror flicks of all time, earned close to $250 million after an initial outlay of just $35,000, while the total cost after incorporating everything including marketing and promotion was closer to $8 or $9 million. Even considering $9 million as the total spend, this is a return of almost 2,800%. Contrast that to Avatar, which unadjusted for inflation, is the highest grossing movie of all time, which earned nearly $3 billion on a budget of $237 million, a return of over 1,200%, less than half of the Blair Witch Project. However, even this doesn't represent the true picture, as the actual determination is more complex.Take Titanic for example. James Cameron's movie of a doomed love story on a doomed ship had a total expenditure, including market, of around $437 million, earned $2.2 billion. That doesn't really compare to the Blair Witch Project, but it is important to know that box office receipts don't all go to film studios, which is a very important consideration for anyone considering to invest in a company which owns film studios. Instead, studios generally get half of the receipts but the longer the movie is played in theaters, the bigger the cut for the film studio. As one of the longest running movies in theaters, Titanic saw its studio get a much bigger piece of the pie than others, which means that Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA), producer of the movie, got to take home a bigger percentage of revenue than most other film studios.This is why it is always important to consider returns in percentage terms rather than in absolute value, as the former truly reveals how much you earned for every dollar you spent. If one of the 30 highest grossing movies of all time adjusted for inflation earned $1 billion but cost $350 million to make, or an indie movie made $100 million but cost $1 million to make, you were much better off investing in the latter.The reason that we've considered the highest grossing movies of all time adjusted for inflation is because otherwise, we'd basically only be considering movies in the last few decades rather than truly considering all movies that were ever released. While it is tricky to consider the impact of inflation and subsequent adjustment, IMDB has done a remarkable job, which is what we've used as a source. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the movies which put their respective film studios on the map, if not enhance their reputation spectacularly, starting with number 30:30. Furious 7Adjusted box office: $1.65 billionThe Fast and Furious series may not be the most thought-provoking series, but it certainly delivers on the action, and blockbuster action movies always sell.29. Enter the DragonAdjusted box office: $1.65 billionBruce Lee's final movie before his death, Enter the Dragon is considered to be among the best martial arts movies in history, with its influence felt in both the U.S. and China, and it has had a lasting impact on action movies since.28.

Ben-HurAdjusted box office: $1.82 billionBen-Hur is one of the best books ever written, and its movie went on to earn 11 Academy Awards, with no movie having earned more.21. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom MenaceAdjusted box office: $1.83 billionThe fourth film in the Star War series, Episode 1 was released in 1999 and is the third most successful movie in the series.20. The Jungle BookAdjusted box office: $1.83 billionThe Jungle Book has been reimagined many times, but it is the 2016 version which has led to it entering the list of the highest grossing movies of all time adjusted for inflation.19. Jurassic WorldAdjusted box office: $1.88 billionJurassic World revived the Jurassic Park franchise, and was surprisingly successful among both critics and the wider audience.18. Spider-Man: No Way HomeAdjusted box office: $1.92 billionThe third part of Marvel's reimagining of Spider-Man was also its most critically and commercially successful movie.17. One Hundred and One DalmationsAdjusted box office: $1.95 billionOne Hundred and One Dalmations is one of the very few animated movies in our list.16.

The film was distributed by Warner Bros., owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD).15. The Lion King (1994)Adjusted box office: $2.15 billionThe Lion King features twice in this list, and nothing can beat the original. From the soundtrack to the story to voice acting, the movie was a marvel on all fronts and represented the peak of Disney's Renaissance Era.14. Avengers: Infinity WarAdjusted box office: $2.17 billionSetting up the scene for Avengers: End Game, Infinity War is one of the most expensive movies ever made.13. JawsAdjusted box office: $2.17 billion47 years after Jaws was released, director Steven Spielberg, whose movies are featured several times in this list, expressed regret for his movie resulting in the decimation of the shark population.12.

Our Alexandra Canal joins us now with the details. Allie, how much did weather affect the-- because the-- because the gross for the first weekend it was out was kind of disappointing so did this make up for that?ALEXANDRA CANAL: You know, box office analysts seem pretty encouraged by this number. Certainly, the intense storms, the weather that we saw across the United States did contribute to a dip in overall moviegoing. But still, domestically, according to Box Office Mojo, the film has grossed roughly $287 million. Per deadline, that number could jump to as much as $294 million once we receive the official results from Monday. A lot of folks off of school, off of work so there is some encouraging signs that we could even see higher levels after the results from yesterday.And that internationally, the film grossing roughly $600 million overseas. And we always knew that the international box office was going to be a big driver for this film. Very similar to the original ""Avatar."" And these numbers actually make this film, nearing $900 million, the fifth-highest grossing film of 2022.And if we take a look at the top four, you'll see ""Top Gun Maverick"" high and above the rest, about $1.5 billion there. Globally, that was followed by ""Jurassic World Dominion,"" ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"" and then ""Minions, The Rise of Gru"" rounding out the top four.So the sequel, I will say, for ""Avatar,"" is outpacing the original film. And that went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time. So there are those signs that we could see more sustained momentum, especially as there's not that much competition. The next big movie is the new iteration of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise coming out February 17.Story continuesSo from now until February 17, it's pretty much just ""Avatar."" But the film is roughly less than half of what it needs in order to be profitable. So James Cameron and Disney are hoping that word of mouth can sustain it over time.JARED BLIKRE: And just real quick, he's-- this is just the first in a number of planned equals. That-- and at least another one is already shot, in the bag. Is that right?ALEXANDRA CANAL: And exactly. At least another one is already shot. I mean, it's been 13 years in the making for this sequel. So there was some concern that maybe people weren't as interested as they were in the past. But it seems like at least right now, people are curious. They want to see it.The visuals have been amazing. There's been some question marks about the plot points. But overall, I do think people are gonna go out and see this movie.JULIE HYMAN: So when you talk about no competition between now and February 17, really in the theaters, there's a lot of competition at home, right? And that's really the big differentiation point between now and when the last ""Avatar"" came out.One of the things that's competing for people's attention was ""Glass Onion,"" which was the-- I guess you could call it the ""Knives Out"" sequel. Although, I was just reading that the director of the movie and the creator of the movie said, he didn't even like that it said ""Knives Out"" on the title of the movie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: No, he's like this is its own movie.JULIE HYMAN: Because it just has one character that carries over, the detective. But do we have any indication as to how that did yet?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, Netflix is gonna release its top 10 list later this afternoon. So we'll find out exactly how well this film did then. But I do think we're gonna see Netflix brag about this movie during its fourth-quarter earnings review.The actual reviews on Rotten Tomatoes has been very strong. And 93% critic and audience score. The film was released in limited theatrical markets over Thanksgiving weekend. And although Netflix did not release the exact box office total, industry estimates had it placed at around $13 million.So there was a lot of talk that Netflix potentially left money on the table by not having a longer, more expansive theatrical release. And this film could be a critical turning point when we think about how streaming companies view the box office, that relationship with the box office.How can it leverage it in order to monetize more effectively? Because we're in this moment that Wall Street has been super critical about all of these media companies. Are you generating a profit? Are you, you know, increasing your free cash flow?

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Exelon The CalculationAs Exelon operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%. Compared to the current share price of US$43.0, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$1.5 / (6.4% – 2.0%)= US$34.1dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Exelon as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Story continuesSWOT Analysis for ExelonStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

282,3e673ef0-4e90-3fca-98d5-9caf59499198,HP,2022-12-28,Helmerich & Payne (HP) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helmerich-payne-hp-great-momentum-170005324.html,1672160405,STORY,['HP'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Helmerich &amp; Payne currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if HP is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this oil and gas well-drilling contractor holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor HP, shares are up 4.51% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry is up 5.14% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 0.51% compares favorably with the industry's 5.86% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Helmerich &amp; Payne have risen 25.87%, and are up 94.67% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 6.11% and -17.27%, respectively.Investors should also take note of HP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, HP is averaging 1,038,480 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with HP.Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HP's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.72 to $4.46 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that HP is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Helmerich &amp; Payne on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Lupa is the first exploration well to be drilled in the production license 229E.Located 27 kilometers northeast of the Goliat field, the well was drilled in a water depth of 403 meters using the Transocean Enablers drilling rig.

The find is expected to contribute to the future gas supply from the Barents Sea. Eni will consider tying back the discovery to existing infrastructure on the Goliat field later.The latest discovery strengthens Eni’s position in the north and could be a step toward achieving additional gas infrastructure in the Barents Sea.

We're pleased with our fourth quarter results and are optimistic about fiscal 2023. My primary things will focus on 3 areas this morning: North America Solutions pricing and margin cycle dynamics; H&amp;P's international opportunities; and our technology and sustainability investments. Our financial results improved substantially quarter-over-quarter as pricing increases, and better contract economics took hold across more of our FlexRig fleet. You may recall from our previous earnings calls this year, we made the point that our rig pricing needed to improve to a level that provides at least a 50% gross margin in order to achieve returns above our cost of capital.I'm encouraged to report that our leading-edge pricing levels are now delivering margins in line with that goal. These are results not seen since the 2012, 2014 upcycle. Strong demand from customers coupled with rollovers of term contracts, should help drive average pricing higher across our active fleet and we believe there is significant momentum heading into fiscal 2023. We plan to maintain a posture of fiscal discipline in our North America Solutions segment and continue to move our average rig margins toward leading-edge pricing and margins. As such, we expect our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 to follow the improving trend of the past 2 fiscal quarters. We are also seeing continued demand for our technology solutions.These solutions have and are anticipated to continue to add significant value for our customers. Many of our technology products and automation solutions are in high demand and are quickly becoming integral parts of the bid process, daily operational workflows and performance-based contracts. These solutions are contributing to H&amp;P becoming the leading drilling solutions provider to many of our customers. Our technology team is creating an exciting future where digital technology will be the key determinant that drives customer value by enabling safer, more efficient and reliable operations. In short, our people are actively caring culture, our rigs, technology and commercial models will continue to differentiate H&amp;P's drilling solutions. Let me now turn to some observations on pricing and margins in our asset intensive business.A key metric to be mindful of here is how much of our customer demand can be satisfied by contractual churn rather than by introducing additional supply into the market. We've talked about churn on previous calls. In this instance, we define churn as the situation where a rig is released from one customer and then re-contracted to another customer within an economically reasonable amount of time, enabling the rig to maintain a high level of activity. During the past 2 quarters, the demand for FlexRig has primarily been satisfied with readily available hot rigs. This allows us to postpone the investment of bringing a rig out of stack and thus exercise capital discipline. Here's an example. In our fourth fiscal quarter, only 1 rig was reactivated out of stack in the quarter.That same quarter, however, we experienced a churn of 14 rigs, and in the third fiscal quarter our churn was 18 rigs with 3 rigs reactivated. The takeaway is that the majority of customer demand in the past couple of quarters has been satisfied by rig churn, not rig reactivations. The reasons for higher or lower churn in the market have typically revolved around acquisitions, efficiency gains, acreage, budgets and supply chain delays. We are seeing churn from both large and small customers, and we suspect this is happening across the market. Currently, while much of the rig demand is being satisfied through churn, there appears to be enough incremental demand growth to reactivate some rigs out of stack as we move into 2023. We mentioned in our October press release announcing our supplemental shareholder return plan and fiscal 2023 CapEx budget that we would reactivate up to 16 rigs.This will allow us to attain a maximum of 192 active FlexRigs for fiscal 2023, sometime during the second fiscal quarter. Regarding these planned reactivations, we are requiring term contracts of at least 2 years. As of today, roughly two-thirds are already committed with the majority of those rigs going to large, publicly traded E&amp;Ps. As in prior years, we expect most of these 2023 rig adds to begin working toward the front half of our fiscal year. Having said this, we also still anticipate contractual churn throughout the year similar to what we experienced in 2022, possibly averaging around 15 rigs per quarter. Understanding these pricing dynamics, holding the line on capital discipline, and not chasing market share is something we believe is crucial to creating a healthy and sustainable company over the longer term.This discipline extends to not only exercising prudence and fiscal restraint, but also careful consideration to putting capital to work in order to take advantage of longer-term growth opportunities. Having this mindset is enabling improved returns for our stakeholders including investors who are returning to invest in the energy space. Moving to our International Solutions segment, the company plans to deploy capital and preparation for more substantial growth in the future. We're seeing opportunities to bid in areas of existing operations as well as in countries that would be new to H&amp;P. Most of the opportunities are where unconventional drilling is in its very early stages, such as in the Middle East. The other opportunity here is the scarcity of digital solutions being applied in many key energy producing regions around the globe.We believe our proven drilling solutions and technologies can provide significant value to national oil companies by jumpstarting the unconventional learning curve. As we look to the future, we believe our international business is an important avenue of growth and serves as a potential outlet for some of our currently idle super-spec rigs in the U.S. International growth also adds diversification to the company's revenue streams over the long-term, and this current allocation of investment capital plays a pivotal role in the execution of our strategy. Shifting to the energy transition, we continue to further our strategy of deploying capital and expertise to companies playing an active role in the transition. As an example, our investments in geothermal are helping to develop an alternative low carbon 24/7 power source.We are providing FlexRigs and our digital technology solutions to enable enhanced geothermal systems and closed loop drilling concepts. Notably, we have made encouraging progress in field trials with 2 of our geothermal investees, Fervo and Eavor. Regarding Fervo, this past September, we completed drilling their enhanced geothermal system pilot project in Nevada, which involves the first 2 horizontal geothermal wells ever drilled in the U.S. And we are currently drilling Eavor's closed loop pilot project in New Mexico. Once complete, we expect this closed loop project to be the deepest and hottest directional geothermal well in history. Our strategic alliances with Fervo and Eavor, and all of our investees has put us firmly on the path toward the advent of next generation geothermal, as H&amp;P takes the lead in unconventional geothermal drilling.We are hopeful that these pilot projects lead to scalable low carbon geothermal developments utilizing FlexRig solutions. Our second sustainability report will be published soon, and we will continue to provide the transparency that is important to our stakeholders. Our team is working hard to continue to raise the bar as a responsible leader in the energy services sector. In summary, we enter fiscal 2023 with momentum and increased confidence that our initiatives in our North America Solutions segment have gained traction and are delivering positive financial results. We are also excited about the longer term prospects and opportunities before us, particularly in our International Solutions segments. Finally, we believe, we've achieved a balanced and responsive capital return methodology with our supplemental shareholder return plan.These actions align with the company's long history of financial stewardship by increasing the company's financial returns through long-term investment in the business, and increasing cash returns to shareholders through the augmentation of our longstanding dividend commitment. For over the past 10 years, we have returned $2.4 billion in dividends. In closing, during my 35-year career, I have never witnessed a higher level of alignment and communication with our customers, resulting in greater transparency and value delivered. As a service and solutions company, the successes H&amp;P has achieved and plans to achieve would not be possible without our devoted, customer focused and hardworking employee base, which I'm proud to say continues to set the standard for our industry.And now, I'll turn the conference call over to Mark.See also 25 Most Visited Countries in the World and 25 Most Technologically Advanced Countries in the World.Mark Smith: Thanks, John. Today, I will review our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2022 operating results; provide guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2023 is appropriate and comment on our financial position. Let me start with highlights for the recently completed fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the company generated quarterly revenues of $631 million versus $550 million in the previous quarter. The increase in revenue relates to continued price increases in the quarter for the North America Solutions fleet. Correspondingly, total direct operating costs incurred were $412 million for the fourth quarter versus $377 million for the previous quarter. The sequential increase was driven by some structural inflation, but to a greater extent maintenance and supply expensive volatility that we typically see in North America Solutions quarter-to-quarter, which ended up being on the higher end of the range this quarter.General and administrative expenses totaled $47 million for the fourth quarter, and $182 million for fiscal 2022, which is in line with our expectations. In other income expense was a loss of approximately $9 million, which was primarily driven by a lump sum distribution for participants exiting our pension plan. Our Q4 effective income tax rate was approximately 38%, which is higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily because of foreign income taxes and permanent book to tax differences. As we crossed the line to become profitable towards the end of the fiscal year, we accrued additional U.S. cash taxes in fiscal 2022, of which approximately $45 million remains that we plan to pay with the extended filing of our tax return in January of 2023.To summarize fourth quarter results, H&amp;P earned a profit of $0.42 per diluted share versus $0.16 in the previous quarter. Earnings per share were negatively impacted by a net $0.03 loss per share of select items, which was primarily made up of the aforementioned contingent item. Absent the select items adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.45 in the fourth fiscal quarter, compared with an adjusted $0.27 during the third fiscal quarter. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 totaled $251 million, which was within the range we established in November of 2021. For John's previous comments on market churn, we limited our rig reactivations mid-fiscal-year and keeping with our strategy of capital discipline. H&amp;P generated $234 million in operating cash flow during fiscal 2022.As we discussed last quarter, our cash flow generation fully funded CapEx and our base dividend in Q3. And this quarter, we were able to do the same and even added some cash to the balance sheet as well. We will discuss accretive FY 2023 cash generation later in these remarks. Turning to our 3 segments beginning with the North America Solutions segment, we averaged 176 contracted rigs during the fourth quarter, up from an average of 174 rigs in fiscal Q3. We exited the fourth fiscal quarter with 176 contracted rigs as expected. Revenues were sequentially higher by $66 million due to pricing increases for our rigs in the spot market and continued repricing of term rollovers. Segment direct margin was $204 million just below the top end of our July guidance and sequentially higher than the third fiscal quarter by $36 million.In addition, reactivation costs of $7.5 million were incurred during Q4 compared to $6.5 million in the prior quarter. The Q4 reactivation costs are primarily related to the rigs being prepared for deployment in the first few months of fiscal 2023. Total segment per day expenses, excluding recommissioning cost and excluding reimbursables increased to 16,453 in the fourth quarter from 15,490 per day in the third quarter. This was above our expectation due primarily to normal maintenance of supplies expense volatility, as well as inflation that I mentioned previously. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023 for North America Solutions, as of today's call, we have 180 rigs contracted, and we expect to end our first fiscal quarter with between 181 and 186 working rigs with expectations for a few additional as in early January, and with line of sight for up to 192 rigs by the end of fiscal Q2.Our current revenue backlog from our North America Solutions fleet is roughly at $864 million for rigs under term contract. As of today, approximately two-thirds of the U.S. active fleet is on a term contract, or increase in term value of approximately $235 million from June 30 to September 30 is due to: one, the reactivation is in the first 2023 fiscal quarter requiring term contracts; and two, term extensions as well as some performance contracts for strategic customers. However, from now through March 31, we have about 65 rigs rolling off of term contracts, with almost half rolling off on March 31. As a result of these more legacy type term rigs rolling off a tailwind is created for the average pricing level of rigs remaining under term contracts.Accordingly, in an oversimplified example, if all of these rigs rolled to the spot market, we would expect the average pricing of our remaining term rigs to benefit roughly 1,500 per day over each of the next couple of quarters as lower price term rigs were simply removed from the average. For reference, we expect the average revenue per day for our term rigs in the first fiscal quarter to be about $30,000 per day. We still expect the percentage of U.S. fleet on term to be between 50% and 60% by the end of fiscal 2023. In the North America Solutions segment, we expect direct margins in fiscal Q1 to range between $250 million to $270 million inclusive of the effect of about $8.5 million in reactivation costs. As of the recent start of fiscal year 2023, we increased field labor related rates to respond to market conditions and assist in talent retention and attraction.As a reminder, our contracts are structured to pass through such labor related costs increases over a 5% threshold. Therefore, significant labor increases are largely margin neutral at the time of adoption due to contractual protections. Also, approximately 70% to 75% of our daily costs are labor related and these recent increases are approximately $650 per day. Our direct margin guidance is inclusive of our expectations for labor and materials inflation in the first fiscal quarter. Regarding our International Solutions segment, as expected International Solutions business activity increased by 3 rigs to exit the quarter with 12 rigs; having added 2 in Argentina and late in the quarter 1 in Colombia. As we look toward the first quarter of fiscal 2023 for International, we expect to add another rig in Argentina and benefit from a full quarter of the recently added rig in Colombia.In our October press release, we mentioned upgrading 5 Argentina rigs to super-spec. These upgrades are performed in Argentina using local currency and are intended to meet ongoing customer demand for unconventional drilling. We will have 9 of 12 FlexRig fleet is working by December 31 and plan to upgrade the 5 that are not super-spec by the end of this fiscal year. We also expect to continue to incur more expenses as we further develop our Middle East hub inclusive of preparation to export super-spec FlexRigs that will be targeted at reasonable unconventional drilling operations. Aside from any foreign exchange impacts, we expect to have between $7 million to $10 million direct margin contribution in the first quarter. While it will not contribute to activity until the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, you may have read reports of our recent investment in rig contract with Tamboran Resources in Australia.Australia was on our long-term planning horizon for opportunities around the burgeoning unconventional plays globally. And we look forward to adding value by bringing your unconventional expertise and experience to this long-term project. Our customer has key acreage in an emerging unconventional gas play in the Beetaloo Basin. And there are no current super-spec rigs in Australia that are suitable for such drilling. H&amp;P's first rig in Australia is being scheduled to ship during the first half of the year. And if our customers successful with their delineation work, we're hopeful that this will be a new region for international growth. Turning to our Offshore Gulf of Mexico segment, we have 4 of our 7 offshore rig  platform rigs contracted, offshore generated direct margin of $9 million during the quarter, which was within our guided range.As we look toward the first quarter of fiscal 2023 for the offshore segment, we expected it will generate between $8 million to $10 million of direct margin. Now, let me look forward to the first fiscal quarter and full fiscal year 2023 for certain consolidated and corporate items. As we increase our rig count, capital expenditures for the full fiscal 2023 year are expected to range between $425 million to $475 million. This capital outlay is comprised of 3 domestic buckets plus international and corporate spend. As discussed on the July call, our North America segment CapEx has 3 buckets, maintenance reactivation and conversion. Our bucket of maintenance CapEx cost is anticipated to push above the high end of our historical range of $750,000 to $1 million per active rig.The fiscal 2023 range is expected to be between $1.1 million and $1.3 million per active rig. As mentioned in our October press release, the reasons for this are twofold. One is due to the reduced spending during the pandemic years when the company judiciously preserved capital spending by utilizing component equipment from idle rigs. Now we're making up for those capital spending deferments. The second reason is the current inflationary environment and supply chain challenges. The second bucket for our North America segment is new for 2023 and includes rig specific reactivation CapEx that is required for the plan to redeployment of up to 16 rigs that have been stacked for some time, much of the spend will be incurred to overhaul componentry that we optimally utilize during the protracted downturn.Such discreet reactivation CapEx is anticipated to range from $1 million to $4 million for each of the 16 rig reactivations planned in the first half of fiscal 2023 depending on the unique rigs particular componentry involved. The final bucket for NAS is the conversion bucket, which relates to the continuation of our walking rig conversion program. We plan to convert 1 rig a month for the first 6 months of fiscal 2023 for reactivation in the U.S. market. As a reminder, our skidding to walking conversions are approximately $7 million per rig. The International segment also has 3 areas of spend concentration: first, we are converting 6 stacked rigs in the U.S. from skidding to walking in the second half of the fiscal year and also incurring recommissioning CapEx for those 6 conversions, which will be exported; second, as mentioned earlier, we're upgrading 5 total rigs in Argentina the super-spec; and third, maintenance CapEx for the International and Offshore segments are collectively expected to be $1 million to $2 million per active rig.Finally, corporate capital investments are expected to be about 10% of our fiscal 2023 CapEx. Two-thirds of this is information technology related, including hardware lifecycle replacements, enhanced data capabilities, and further improvements to our infrastructure, communications and cybersecurity. Depreciation for fiscal 2023 is expected to be approximately $400 million. A few overarching comments and capital expenditures are in order; first, CapEx is up year-over-year, as we are investing to maintain our U.S. fleet with modest growth this year, as well as investing in international growth for future year margin generation as well as geographic margin diversity. It is important to note that after our planned 16 U.S. rig reactivations and our planned 6 international rig exports, we will have 32 remaining stacked super-spec FlexRigs located in the U.S. for future growth domestically or internationally in upcoming years.Second, if you exclude the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 capital intensity, which we measure as CapEx as a percentage of revenue should be among the lowest it has been in the last 10 years in fiscal 2023 This reduced capital intensity results in return and cash flow generation which I will comment on more in a few minutes. Finally, like fiscal 2022, we are committed to our CapEx guidance for fiscal 2023 barring any unexpected investment opportunities in the international markets. Our general and administrative expenses for the full fiscal 2023 year are expected to be approximately $195 million, which is up from the year recently completed, which had an average of 163 rigs working. While this annual G&amp;A spend, there's just under the $50 million per quarter run rate we had going into the pandemic, when we had approximately 195 rigs working.We're expecting to operate about the same number of rigs in an inflationary environment. And at the same time, we're building capabilities to support future international growth. In essence, we're doing a bit more with a little less for support costs. Specifically, we expect about $50 million of expense in Q1 with the remainder spread proportionally over the final 3 quarters. Our investment and research and development remains largely focused on solutions important to our customers such as drilling automation, wellbore quality and power management. We anticipate R&amp;D expenditures to be approximately $28 million in fiscal 2023. As a result of our return to profitability, we are once again becoming a U.S. quarterly estimated taxpayer. We are expecting an effective income tax rate range of 23% to 28% with the variance above U.S. statutory rate of 21% driven by state and foreign taxes.Based upon estimated fiscal 2023 operating results and CapEx, we are projecting a consolidated cash tax range of $190 million to $240 million, of which $45 million relates to fiscal 2022 taxes to be paid in fiscal 2023, resulting in a cash tax range of $145 million to $195 million related to fiscal 2023 activity. Of note, we currently estimate that the impact of our deferred tax liability roll off for fiscal 2023 is less than $10 million. It should be noted these ranges do not include approximately $28 million in federal tax receivables on September 30, 2022, of which about $25 million were subsequently collected in October after the fiscal year end. Now, looking at our financial position. Helmerich &amp; Payne had cash and short-term investments of approximately $350 million as September 30, 2022 versus $333 million at June 30.Including availability under revolving credit facility our liquidity remains at approximately $1.1 billion. We again expect changes in the components of working capital to reduce cash in fiscal 2023, as was the case in fiscal 2022. Whenever revenue increases, as we expect with pricing uplifts across the fiscal year, rising receivables create a use of cash. Fiscal Q1 is expected to experience lower cash flow from operations in the following quarters due to the planned rig reactivations and ongoing price increases. Earlier, I mentioned the cash flow generation expected for fiscal 2023. As John mentioned, moving through fiscal 2023, our returns as measured in ROIC should be back in line with level seen in 2014 and earlier. These levels are expected to be well into the double digits as an average across the fiscal year and, therefore, in excess of our estimated weighted average cost of capital.As announced in our October press release subject to ongoing board approval, we plan to pay supplemental dividends across fiscal 2023 of approximately $100 million, which is approximately 50% of the remaining cash flow after CapEx and after our established base dividends. So in essence, these results in a full two-thirds of cash flow after CapEx return to shareholders, with one-third retained for flexibility. As of today, with this flexible $100 million unallocated, we would expect to end the fiscal year with between $430 million and $490 million of cash and $60 million to $120 million of net debt. However, that is not the intention. Rather going forward, we will reassess this allocation throughout the year with an eye toward opportunistic share repurchases, additional dividends and/or accretive investment opportunities.That said, our current plans for capital allocation look to further add to our longstanding priority, the returning cash to shareholders and add to the roughly $2.7 billion of cash that we have return to shareholders during the past 10 years through dividends and share repurchases. That concludes our prepared comments for the fourth fiscal quarter. Let me now turn the call over to Ashley for questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Colgate-Palmolive Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, John Kooyman, sold US$200k worth of shares at a price of US$77.06 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$79.94, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 13% of John Kooyman's holding. John Kooyman was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.1% of Colgate-Palmolive shares, worth about US$69m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The Colgate-Palmolive Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Colgate-Palmolive insiders. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Not to be a downer but circumstances don’t appear particularly compelling for the bulls. At the top, global recession fears rise as multiple countries struggle with inflation and coronavirus-fueled disruptions.Closer to home, the Federal Reserve presents significant worries for market participants. Recently, the November jobs report came in hotter than expected. While typically a positive dynamic, the resultant framework – more dollars chasing after fewer goods – repudiated the central bank’s efforts to contain inflation through higher rates.Translation? More than likely, the Fed will double down on its hawkish monetary policies. And that means stocks to buy that feature stable or relevant businesses should outperform the others.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMSFTMicrosoft$238.73CVXChevron$177.40CLColgate-Palmolive$79.45ALLAllstate$136.37COSTCostco$462.65DLTRDollar Tree$141.91AWKAmerican Water Works$153.02Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comWhile consumer technology firms typically don’t represent stocks to buy for stability’s sake, an exception can be made for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Unlike your typical aspirational tech player, Microsoft has become fully integrated into everyday life. For instance, its Windows operating system dominates the desktop market. And although smart devices may dominate the retail segment, desktops still undergird professional operations.In other words, it’s difficult to be productive with a tablet no matter how cute it is. Further, with major enterprises announcing layoffs, people fluent in digital business architectures will likely succeed. Cynically but realistically, this dynamic puts Microsoft in the driver’s seat.Most importantly, solid all-around financials undergird MSFT stock. From a stable balance sheet to solid long-term revenue growth to a high-quality business profile, you can’t go wrong with Microsoft.Story continuesNot surprisingly, then, analysts love MSFT, rating it a consensus strong buy. Out of 28 of Wall Street’s experts, no one has a sell rating and only three stated that it’s a hold. Thus, MSFT is one of the stocks to buy ahead of a slow 2023.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWith Russia’s utterly shocking invasion of Ukraine, a lot has been made of the relevancies of hydrocarbon specialists such as Chevron (NYSE:CVX). One of the big oil firms, Chevron covers all the bases of the industry, ranging from upstream (exploration and production), midstream (storage and transportation), and downstream (refining and marketing). Naturally, CVX won big in 2022, gaining over 46% on a year-to-date basis.Still, questions surround the sustainability of Chevron and its ilk. With countries waking up to the dangers of energy dependency on unreliable partners, many fast-tracked renewable energy initiatives. The thing is, such projects will take time to implement. And some regions just don’t have the geographical or climate-based endowment to support renewable infrastructures.Therefore, CVX represents one of the stocks to buy for ongoing relevancies. To be fair, analysts have started to shy away from Chevron, rating it a consensus hold. Nevertheless, hedge funds – or smart money – built up their position in CVX significantly. In this case, I think they’re on the right path.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comOne of the more boring stocks to buy that you can think of, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) won’t get your blood flowing. However, boring is good during uncertain times. Primarily, Colgate-Palmolive benefits from inelastic demand. Stated differently, no matter what happens to the underlying products’ pricing, they benefit from consistent, predictable demand.For example, people should usually aim to brush their teeth three times a day, along with flossing at least once a day. Now, whether a recession materializes or not, dentists will still recommend a typical teeth-cleaning regimen. Further, with economic pressures building, some folks might skip a dental appointment or two – just like during the Covid-19 days.According to analysts, CL rates as a consensus moderate buy. It’s not the most confident of assessments: among 13 analysts, six rated it a buy, and seven rated it a hold. Nevertheless, generally rising interest among hedge funds makes Colgate an interesting potential candidate for stocks to buy.Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs you’ll see down below, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) doesn’t exactly win on every financial and investment metric. However, if you’re looking for stable stocks to buy, you shouldn’t ignore ALL (or its closest rivals). Since the start of the year, ALL returned nearly 14% of equity value for its stakeholders. In contrast, a theoretical share of the S&amp;P 500 during the same period would have netted you a 19% loss.I’ll take the 14%, thank you very much! Better yet, the framework should still be positive for ALL stock. Fundamentally, the underlying company benefits from a hostage audience. For instance, most states in the U.S. require auto insurance. Plus, with employers likely to force their workers to return to the office, the morning commute will be back. Cynically, this dynamic supports ALL as one of the stocks to buy.Now, while Gurufocus.com rates Allstate as modestly undervalued, you should be aware that its profit margins (on a trailing 12-month basis) sit in negative territory. Also, hedge funds dropped some exposure in the third quarter of this year. Still, Wall Street rates ALL as a consensus moderate buy.Costco (COST)Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession PickSource: ShutterstockWith circumstances cloudy for 2023, investors ought to consider warehouse-style retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) as one of the stocks to buy. Fundamentally, I appreciate how the business can easily adapt to varying circumstances.Let’s say that inflation continues to worsen next year despite the Fed’s best efforts to contain it. By logical deduction, Costco offers a practical mechanism to beat rising prices. Through bulk purchases, consumers can mitigate the erosion of the dollar’s purchasing power.On the other hand, if deflation becomes the norm, Costco has an answer to that too. With the company featuring a consumer demographic with a higher-than-average income, it caters to the affluent and upwardly mobile. Additionally, higher income usually equates to higher educational attainment, a positive during an economic downturn. Wall Street analysts also have the same idea, assigning COST a moderate buy consensus view. Out of 25 experts, 18 rated COST a buy while seven rated it a hold.Dollar Tree (DLTR)store front of a Dollar Tree location with green signageSource: shutterstock.com/Jonathan WeissDepending on how severe a potential slowdown might be in 2023, investors ought to consider Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) as a candidate for stocks to buy. Under the principle of the trade-down effect, consumers probably won’t drop from a top-tier retailer to a discount dollar store. Instead, they’ll taper down their purchases until finding a reasonable balance between price and quality.However, it’s also important to note that the biggest beneficiaries of the Covid-19 crisis were affluent. In other words, the widening wealth gap indicates that much of the country is hurting. Another major crisis could send blistering demand to Dollar Tree (and admittedly its ilk). Therefore, it might make sense to plan DLTR as one of the stocks to buy now. Presently, analysts rate Dollar Tree as a consensus moderate buy. However, it’s a tricky narrative. Among 15 experts, nine rated it a buy, five a hold, and one a sell. To be fair, hedge funds have also been limiting their exposure. Still, with price sensitivity likely to become a major issue, it’s worth keeping close tabs on DLTR.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comProbably the riskiest idea on this list of stocks to buy, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a public utility that specializes in water and water treatment services. Fundamentally, the business features relevance because of its underlying predictability. I’m not going to say it has the cleanest financials. However, water represents our most precious resource. Therefore, its management will only become more critical over time.Of course, the main distraction for AWK is its market loss. Since the start of the year, AWK dropped more than 17% in equity value. Quite frankly, the volatility is not that far removed from the aforementioned benchmark equity index. Still, in the trailing half-year period, AWK gained over 11%. And in the trailing month, shares swung up nearly 3%.To be fair, hedge funds reduced some of their exposure in Q3 this year (relative to Q2). Nevertheless, over the past several quarters, these institutional investors have been building a sizable position. Ultimately, then, AWK is one of the stocks to buy ahead of potential uncertainties.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Comcast Comcast Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, for US$397k worth of shares, at about US$44.50 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$35.00. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Comcast insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Comcast Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Comcast. In total, Independent Director Kenneth Bacon dumped US$72k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Comcast insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$1.4b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Comcast Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Comcast stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Comcast you should know about.But note: Comcast may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

You can skip our industry analysis and go directly to the 5 Best Streaming Stocks To Buy Now.Almost every three decades, Hollywood undergoes a complete transformation. The shift from silent movies to talkies in the 1920s, the boom of broadcast television in the 1950s, the “I Want My MTV” cable from the 1980s, and the internet-based streaming services in the 2000s are all examples of these seismic transformations. The introduction of YouTube in 2005 by a group of ex-PayPal employees can be considered the spark of the streaming service era. YouTube, only after a year of its launch, was acquired by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for $1.65 billion, which seemed like an unnecessary investment at the time as the company had not generated any substantial profit, although, for corporations like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), it was clear that streaming is the next frontier in media entertainment.There are currently more than 200 streaming services available for consumers worldwide that offer all sorts of media entertainment, including videos, music, games, etc. With time, the streaming market is getting crowded and competitive, and companies are trying to be at the top by following new trends and ideas that might give them an edge over the others. One such trend is the localization of content that caters to the audience of a specific region through translations and subtitles of their favorite content in their respective languages. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently launched localized versions of its Amazon Prime in Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines to get its hold on Southeast Asia’s biggest market. Original content has also been the focus of these streaming services as an extension to localized content. Recently, original content production by streaming platforms has become popular. The Oscar-winning Korean movie “Parasite” by Amazon Prime, one of the most viewed Korean TV series “Squid Games” and the first German Netflix Show “Dark” by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) are a few examples of original content produced by streaming platforms.Story continuesThe shift to digitization after the outbreak of COVID-19 also served as a tailwind for the streaming industry. The subscriber count of streaming services skyrocketed during the pandemic as the world was almost entirely bound to their homes which increased the demand for streaming service providers. During the pandemic, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reached a milestone of 200 million subscribers, and Disney+, which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), hit a subscriber count of 100 million.In the coming years, the streaming service industry will continue to grow as the demand for both new content as well as revamped, and rebooted content keeps fueling the growth of the industry. In 2021, the global market size of the streaming service industry was valued at $375.1 billion. The market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 18.45% to reach $1,721.4 billion by 2030.Our MethodologyWe selected 11 best streaming stocks to buy now based purely on hedge fund sentiment towards those stocks.

Here is what the fund said:The Portfolio first bought Roku in Q3’20. It was a company we followed closely given our investment in The Trade Desk and its importance in connected television (CTV). Roku continued to impressively grow its CTV market share and it took some extra work to understand the underlying dynamics causing Roku’s success. I think there is some misunderstanding surrounding the connected television landscape.

293,9e4f8ad0-9ed9-3e67-a293-df79fb0ac7d6,CMCSA,2022-12-28,Houston: A City With a 'Big Heart' and a Bigger Lesson,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/houston-city-big-heart-bigger-162000690.html,1672158000,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 27, 2022 / Comcast CorporationComcast Corporation, Tuesday, December 27, 2022, Press release pictureThe city of Houston is sometimes known as The Big Heart. And just days before Thanksgiving, I met Gayla Hall and found out why that is.Gayla, like so many in the city, came downtown to St. John's Bread of Life to ensure her family had enough food on the table to celebrate the holiday-and household supplies and pantry staples to sustain them long after. As Comcast volunteers carefully and caringly placed these essentials in the trunks of cars, I met with Gayla and a few others to surprise them with perhaps one of the ultimate essentials of these times: a brand-new laptop.Surely, Gayla could have used the device herself. Still, she told me she wasn't keeping it. Instead, she was going to give it to her 87-year-old mother. Throughout the pandemic, Gayla's mother has been communicating with her doctors over the phone. Now, with her new laptop, she can meet with them ""face-to-face,"" ensuring she gets better treatment, faster.That day in Houston, I was reminded once again of the power of a home-based high-speed Internet connection as well as a high-quality device to get online. But Gayla reminded me of something else, too, that being our own capacity to help empower others to change their own lives for the better.The Power of Digital NavigatorsI've been speaking a lot lately about the impact of Digital Navigators - and during my visit to Houston I witnessed that power first-hand. Digital navigators are people - volunteers and paid staff - who help other people get online, get them signed up for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), assist them in setting up new devices, and teach them how to navigate the Internet. Simply put, digital navigators remove critical barriers to Internet adoption - and in doing so, are a uniquely human solution to help close the digital divide.At Comcast, we are investing in digital navigators through Project UP, our 10-year, $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity. And in Houston, I got to announce a $150,000 grant to support a new digital navigator pilot program with the City of Houston Mayor's Office of Complete Communities and SERJobs. This program will bring trusted tech experts to four of Houston's historically under-resourced neighborhoods - Acres Homes, Kashmere Gardens, Magnolia Park-Manchester, and Sunnyside. These experts will provide one-on-one support to hundreds of Houstonians whose lives will change as they are able to take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.Story continuesOne of the most inspiring events during the trip to Houston took place at Acres Homes Multi-Service Center. There, we surprised high school students and senior citizens with 100 free laptops. The high school students shared stories about the value that Internet access and devices bring to their own education; they also shared wonderful stories about how their own parents, grandparents, and neighbors get online. In their own ways, they serve as digital navigators.And the senior citizens, who were participating in an interactive digital navigator training, told me why the workshop was so uniquely valuable to them. Jana, for instance, is a retired music teacher. She promised her mother that she would share her music lessons with the world, and she is determined to learn how to get those lessons online. Jana is another example of the power of digital navigators.The Power of Community PartnersI was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. And although my hometown is 1,440 miles away from Houston, the two cities share legacies of racial segregation and sweeping disparities in opportunity and resources. During my keynote speech at the 100 Black Men of Houston Education Summit, I shared the story of how my parents were determined to do all they could to give me the tools essential to defy expectations. For the most part that meant encyclopedias and trips to museums and libraries.The truth is, to succeed today, a high-speed Internet connection at home is essential. So, I asked the educators gathered to spread the word about our Internet Essentials program. Since 2011, Comcast has connected more than 10 million Americans to the Internet at home, many for the first time. That's more than 10 million lives changed forever.As I said at the Summit, the Internet is power. It is the power to seek opportunity and knowledge, to learn new skills and find community, to stay informed, to organize - to limit the time you spend on chores and errands to spend more time with the people you love. A high-speed Internet connection is not a perk or a privilege. It's a precondition for full participation in society as a whole. It's how you succeed. It's how you excel. It's how you become exceptional.The Power of Comcast VolunteersMy trip to the Big Heart had one final takeaway: our power to change lives is greater when we work together. Through Team UP, Comcast's volunteer program, we bring local employees together with local non-profit organizations to support those in need within our own communities - and last month in Houston, that's exactly what we did.At St. John's Bread of Life, where I met Gayla, Comcast volunteers helped pass out Thanksgiving meals to needy families, and we gave away 100 laptops to families there as well. And at the Career and Recovery Resources Center in downtown Houston, a team of Comcast employees and volunteers gathered to paint an inspiring mural on the side of the building, alongside local artist Gonzo247. The ""Make Your Wake"" mural he designed represents the idea of riding out whatever challenges life brings our way and emerging safely through the storms.Wherever I travel - to Houston and Detroit, to San Francisco and Fresno - I am in awe of the grit and the generosity of our employees and our partners. It is clear that in the 21st century, opportunity awaits everyone online. Working together, I believe we have the once-in-a-generation chance to empower everyone to seize it.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: http://www.comcastcorporation.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/733324/Houston-A-City-With-a-Big-Heart-and-a-Bigger-Lesson]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. United Rentals (URI) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 25, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $10.17 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $10.17 Most Accurate Estimate and the $9.93 Zacks Consensus Estimate, United Rentals has an Earnings ESP of 2.35%.URI is just one of a large group of Construction stocks with a positive ESP figure. Fluor (FLR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on February 28, 2023, Fluor holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.51 a share 64 days from its next quarterly update.Fluor's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.66% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.51.Story continuesURI and FLR's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Here to break it down is Futurum Research principal analyst Daniel Newman. Daniel, so we saw Micron claiming its inventories are now well above target levels. What exactly happened here with this chip glut?DANIEL NEWMAN: Well, just like we ended up in a shortage, nobody really expected so much demand to come on so quickly. And chipmakers weren't able to ramp up the inventory quickly enough. And so as that demand kind of swelled and stayed intact for more than a year following the initial pandemic, as people bought cars, gaming consoles, PC, servers in the data center, the same thing happened on the way down. We saw what happened with the Fed.We raised rates. We see we're heading into a recession. Discretionary income is down. People's balance sheets at home are not as good as they were. And all of a sudden, all these companies that ramped up have all this extra inventory. And effectively, we don't have the demand we had. And so now the inventory is there, and prices are coming down, and chipmakers are hurting.SEANA SMITH: And Daniel, we certainly have seen a number of chip makers respond and start to shift their operations or how they're approaching business over the coming quarters. Micron cutting 10% of its workforce as that demand drops. When it comes to these inventory levels, the fact that they are so swelled at this point, how long until those inventory levels, I guess, get to more appropriate or what is, I guess, considered a historic norm?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, we're hearing different things from different leaders in these companies. We've heard from Nvidia's leadership that it should be some time at the end of this quarter, which, for them, ends in January. We heard Sanjay Mehrotra of Micron say probably in the second half of this year. I think some of the specificity is going to go around, whether are they data center chips, are they automotive chips, are they gaming consoles, are they PCs.Story continuesEach of these have their own sort of boom and bust cycles, but of course, we're seeing sort of an overall bust cycle right now. I like the chip companies that are more centric to things like cloud data center and automotive. And those that are really heavily into gaming and PC, I think a lot of their demand got pulled forward. And you could see it a longer time. So that's why Mehrotra said second half of this year, Nvidia's gaming chips, parts of Intel and AMD, they're probably looking at second half or later before they really start to see normal demand come back.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Daniel, so I covered the auto sector. And we're still seeing a lot of the chip crunch happening there across a number of automakers. You mentioned that it's specific to different sectors. What is it about these chips that the auto sector needs is just-- is not-- the industry is not actually pumping out enough of them?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, it's really interesting. The automotive sector depends a lot on these lagging edge semiconductors, which is 14 nanometer and above. These are often produced by the likes of Tower Semiconductors, GlobalFoundries. A lot of what we're hearing, the resiliency, the fabs being built are more of these newer leading edge. These are the 5 and 7 nanometer process.So what's happened is we have all this demand peaking for automotive. You've got cars now that have more semiconductors in them than ever before, but we haven't really increased the production of capabilities like we're doing, and we haven't finished yet, but on a lot of these leading edge with the CHIPS Act. So we don't have the production capabilities to kind of get up to all this demand we had for automotive. And so we're still seeing car prices are still pretty high. Used car demand is still a little bit swelled. And all these chip makers are going to need to keep ramping up production to ever catch up on these automotive designs that are semiconductor intensive.SEANA SMITH: Daniel, we heard from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger back in October. And he said, quote, ""It's just hard to see any points of good news on the horizon."" We know that Intel then issued a muted outlook. They also announced job cuts. Do you see is there any reason to be optimistic about this sector heading into the new year?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, if you zoom out overall, it's really hard to see a world that isn't going to be accelerated by technology, whether that's supercomputing in AI. Whether that's the next generation of vehicles, data centers and the cloud, and the software that enterprises run to operate, all these things require semiconductors. Over the next 12 months, during a tight recessionary period, I believe companies are going to try to do more with what they have technology wise, which means less buying of PCs and servers, which means a tougher outlook in the short-term.But in the long run, the amount of software, the digitalization of everything means more semiconductors. You really got to follow those boom and bust cycles. We are in a bust cycle that was accelerated by a crazy boom. But the semiconductor tends to run pretty closely with those economic up and downs. I think as we start to come out of this economic downturn, you'll see the semiconductor volume pick up in a big way, as it's going to be critical to the advancement of our infrastructure and of business.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Daniel, so do you think that the CHIPS Act will kind of help that boom-bust, smooth it out a bit more? And who can really actually benefit in terms of the companies from that act?DANIEL NEWMAN: Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, some of this demand planning, the supply chain issues that we have, the hyperdependency we've created with Taiwan, I mean, we definitely put ourselves in a bit of a difficult situation. We, of course, have great relations with Taiwan, but there's a lot of microaggression going on with China that's creating some discomfort. We've got some new tariffs and some new regulatory policy going against certain chips shipping over to China.We need to bring more production here to the United States. We need to bring more production on the leading edge. We need to bring more, as I mentioned with automotive, on some of those lagging, older process technologies, 14 nanometer and above. I think Intel has got the biggest opportunity to benefit. But we're seeing Micron, IBM. I mean, TSMC is reaching out for money. And all the fabless companies can benefit from some of the dollars that are there for innovation, R&amp;D, and design in the extension of the CHIPS and Sciences Act.But I like Intel's prospects. If they can get policymakers behind them, this could be a good moment for Intel. But of course, TSMC has had so much success. It'll be interesting to see does our government back the Taiwanese manufacturer to do more leading edge here, or does more dollars go to Intel, which may be a good idea for the national security and resiliency that we are needing in the future.SEANA SMITH: Certainly a number of stories to keep an eye on when it comes to the chip sector in 2020. Daniel Newman, as always, thanks so much for joining us here this afternoon.]"

Micron, Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM), Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC: SSNLF), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) repeatedly cut their sales projections this year.However, the industry expected chip sales to double by 2030, surpassing $1 trillion globally. Micron eyed a facility in upstate New York that could cost up to $100 billion, partly funded by U.S. government incentives.Some chip makers like Lattice Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ: LSCC) saw the inventory buildup as an opportunity.Price Action: MU shares traded higher by 0.68% at $50.54 in the premarket on the last check Tuesday.Story continuesSee more from BenzingaBloomberg Disowns Reports Of Acquisition Plans For Dow Jones And Washington PostWhat's New In Wuhan?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Aon Aon Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Eric Andersen, for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$283 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$301. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 5.7% of Eric Andersen's holding.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 4.40k shares for US$1.3m. But insiders sold 9.65k shares worth US$2.7m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Aon than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Aon better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Aon Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Aon insiders own about US$713m worth of shares (which is 1.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Aon Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Aon, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example, Aon has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is significant) we think you should know about.Of course Aon may not be the best stock to buy.

However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At McDonald'sThe Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$256 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$267, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was 53% of Ian Borden's holding.In total, McDonald's insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

Neither the lack of buying nor the presence of selling is heartening. But the amount sold isn't enough for us to put any weight on it.Story continuesDoes McDonald's Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. McDonald's insiders own 0.09% of the company, currently worth about US$182m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At McDonald's Tell Us?While there has not been any insider buying in the last three months, there has been selling. But given the selling was modest, we're not worried. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of McDonald's insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Marcelo, over to you.Diet, FoodPhoto by Louis Hansel on UnsplashMarcelo Rabach: Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. Today, Luis, Mariano and I will take you through the highlights of our consolidated and divisional results for the third quarter of 2022. Mariano will also cover our balance sheet and growth metrics, and Luis will provide an update on the 3D strategy of digital, Delivery and Drive-thru that has been driving the strongest operating and financial results in our history. I'll wrap up with the Recipe for the Future and some final thoughts on 2022 and beyond. In our discussion of a third quarter results, you will see that we were able to maintain the strong trends of the last several quarters and build on what we told you was a better-than-expected month of July.Story continuesThis means business momentum was very strong as we headed into the year's most important quarter and that's why we finalized our plans for next year as well. Total revenue in the third quarter reached $916 million, comparable sales grew more than 34% versus the prior year boosted by higher guest volumes and market share gains throughout the Arcos' footprint. We leveraged our structural competitive advantages, with a continued focus on our winning Three D's strategy. Digital Sales contributed 42% of the quarter systemwide sales reaching almost $500 million. This new three-month record included all-time highs in mobile app, Self-order Kiosks and Mobile Order and Pay. Delivery and drive-thru sales grew 34% and 11% in constant currency respectively.These increases came from gains in both guest volume and average check and far outperformed many other restaurant chains, even on-premise sales continued normalizing. We have been able to sustain growth on these channels, thanks to the structure and competitive advantage offered by our freestanding restaurant portfolio and discipline operational execution. Luis, we'll take a closer look at these results in a few minutes. Although, we were facing a comparison with last year's record third quarter result, adjusted EBITDA in US dollars rose another 15% this year. By focusing on sustainable sales growth, we generated operating leverage to help offset some of the headwinds we knew we would face in the quarter. Last year's reported result was helped by a tax credit in Brazil, as well as government payroll support programs in SLAD.This year, food and paper cost remain elevated. And we also have the final step up in our royalty rate. Despite all these factors, EBITDA margin remained solidly in double digits, and net income almost double versus last year. Now let's dig into the results by division, starting with Luis who will run us through divisional sales performance.Luis Raganato: Thanks Marcelo. Comparable sales growth remained strong in the third quarter, increasing at a rate of about two times blended inflation for the period. This is about execution. Here we say that it's not real, unless it's real in the restaurant. We attract guests through marketing and digital initiatives. But guests keep coming back because they have a great experience each time they interact with a McDonald's brand. It doesn't matter if it's a physical visit or a digital interaction. Their experience must be great. Brazil's comparable sales rose 21.8% in the quarter, about 2.5x inflation in the period. Digital Sales penetration rate in Brazil is the highest of all Arcos market, generating 52% of systemwide sales in the quarter.As Marcelo already mentioned, off-premise sales growth was strong in the quarter, even as on-premise sales normalized. This sustained the recent trend of industry leading market share gains as QSR took additional share from informal players in the country's restaurant industry. Brazil's marketing activities in the quarter focused on programs and investments designed to reinforce the brand's core strengths. For example, leveraging its cultural relevance by partnering with Thiaguinho, one of Brazil's pop artists for the latest installment of their successful Famous Orders campaign. To drive further digital adoption, we invested in a 360-degree campaign to promote the Mobile Order and Pay feature of the app. This omnichannel approach to the digital strategy is strengthening brand perception related to convenience and generating significant sales growth in this channel.After the quarter ended, we shifted gears in Brazil to leverage the McDonald's global sponsorship of the FIFA World Cup. We introduced a highly anticipated lineup of eight sandwiches. Each day of the week features a specific country themed sandwich, including Argentina, France, Germany, and Mexico. The Mac Brazil, which was available every day has already sold out. Clearly the campaign has been a resounding success, and we just had our best ever month of October in terms of sales. NOLAD's top line continue to be driven by Mexico, Costa Rica and the French West Indies. Comparable sales grew at 2.6x the divisions blended inflation rate in the quarter, leading to additional market share gains in all main markets. Marketing in NOLAD featured many innovations such as the introduction of the Ultra Hyper Mega Tasty campaign that leverages the Signature Beef and McCrispy Chicken platforms in Mexico.Costa Rica became the first market in the Arcos Dorados footprint to launch Best Burger. This ambitious, global project provides an enhanced flavor profile and improved quality perception among guests, which is already showing strong results. Digital sales in NOLAD grew around 200% versus the prior year quarter, aided by the continuous improvements in each market's Mobile App functionality, including Mobile Order and Pay, as well as greater marketing investments to promote the Digital platform. NOLAD also launched localized world up sandwich campaigns in our markets within the last three to four weeks with excellent results so far. SLAD's comparable sales growth reflected strong top line performance in all its main markets, rising at 1.8x blended inflation in the period.The sales growth helped McDonald's brand market share expand in the division, driven by higher guest traffic both on and off premise. Digital Sales penetration also rose in the period with 43% of SLAD's third quarter sales coming from digital channels, all of which grew sequentially versus the prior quarter. Marketing in SLAD continued building brand love with Generation Z guests thanks to a Famous Orders campaign with the popular Latin artist SebastiÃ¡n Yatra. During the quarter, we introduced the McCrispy Chicken sandwich to the menu in Colombia and Chile, where it received strong guest response. We also had great new in the dessert business with the launch of the McFlurry Chocoramo in Colombia. This locally relevant product generated guest excitement and drove unit sales to the highest level ever in that country.As in Brazil and NOLAD, fourth quarter marketing SLAD is now focused on the FIFA World Cup. Linking one of the region's most culturally important sporting events with the McDonald's brand provides us with an exclusive opportunity to connect with guests and drive sales leaving into the month-long tournament. Over Mariano for a look at how strong revenue growth drove record profitability.Mariano Tannenbaum: Thanks, Luis. As you've already heard, today, we are reporting another quarter of strong adjusted EBITDA growth and the performance remains broad based, with all three divisions generating solid profitability in the quarter. Starting with consolidated EBITDA margin, we improved occupancy and other operating expenses, thanks to well above inflation sales growth. Payroll expenses were only higher versus 2021 because of the government support programs that helped last year's result. Excluding the support from last year's number. payroll expenses were lower this year and are solid below 20% of company operated sales. As we told you to expect on our last couple of course, we experienced gross margin pressure in the third quarter.Brazil's gross margin improved, but this was offset by higher food and paper costs in the other two divisions, especially NOLAD. We continue to expect full year 2022 food and paper costs to about equal to full year 2021 as a percentage of sales. Finally, G&amp;A expenses remained relatively flat in margin terms. Turning to the divisions and starting with Brazil, EBITDA grew more than 20% in constant currency, even though last year's result, included a nonrecurring tax credit. Healthy revenue growth generated an improvement in gross margin, and operating leverage in restaurant expenses that more than offset the final step up in the royalty rate. In NOLAD, EBITDA margin remained at nearly double digits as strong revenue growth generated operating leverage to partially offset a tougher cost environment and the final step up in the royalty rate.Results were also negatively impacted by Hurricane Fiona that hit Puerto Rico in September. Importantly, however, EBITDA in US dollars still grew versus last year. SLAD's revenue growth successfully generated operating leverage in the quarter offsetting some cost pressures to expand EBITDA margin and deliver strong US dollar EBITDA growth. Our strategic focus remains squarely on long term profitable growth. We expect to sustain comparable sales growth at or above inflation, which can generate additional operating efficiencies. With that outlook, we expect to accelerate restaurant openings moving forward. Cash generated from operations exceeded $235 million in the first nine months of this year. With a stable numerator and improved denominator net leverage was just 1x as of September 30, 2022.Additionally, the average maturity of our debt is now at around six years, two more than at the end of the first quarter of 2022. We are using this privileged financial position to our advantage today, and we'll use it to support our future growth plans as well. Through the first nine months of 2022, we opened 45 restaurants, including 40 freestanding units. In Brazil, we opened 30 new restaurants of which 27 are freestanding units. We also continue strengthening the industry's best digital platform by investing in the development of new capabilities, and running out existing features to additional markets. I am pleased to tell you that as of today, we have already opened the 55 restaurants we guided to for the full year. And we are on track to open another 10 additional restaurants before the end of the year.Around 90% of all openings continue to be freestanding locations, which are generating above average returns thanks to high sales per unit and efficient operations. Looking ahead, we expect to accelerate our pace of growth. The development team has increased the size of the already robust pipeline for the next several years. And recent openings are proving that there is still a lot of growth potential for the McDonald's brand in our region. It has become very clear that penetration generates demand and we are working to ensure that we capture that demand with the best return possible for shareholders. We plan to tell you more about this in early February of 2023 when we expect to hold an in-person Investor Day in Sao Paulo, Brazil. As we have done for the last couple of years, we expect to provide you with a preview of fourth quarter 2022 results as well as our growth outlook for 2023 and beyond.The IR team will be sending out a save the date in the coming days. Back to Luis for a closer look at the three D's, Digital, Delivery and Drive-thru.See also 16 Biggest Utility Companies in the US and 12 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics.Luis Raganato: Digital now accounts for 42% of total sales. And it's not just delivery driving growth in digital. In the third quarter, we also set new records in Self-order Kiosks sales, which were available in more than 900 ELTF restaurants, Mobile Order and Pay sales supported by enhance functionality, and it rolled out to a growing number of markets, and sales generated through the Mobile App, which has been downloaded almost 80 million times and is the main digital communication platform with guests. In the third quarter identified sales grew by 67% versus the prior year. As a result, 17% of total sales were identified, including 21% in Brazil. These are sales from guests who have opted in to allow their data to be used in our marketing activities, which enables us to enhance their McDonald's experience and maximize profitability.This is all part of the omnichannel approach we started telling you about in 2019. Guests today have never had so many choices and how they interact with us. Ease of use drives higher frequency, which explains the increasingly higher revenue per guest within the Arcos Dorados digital ecosystem. Among the newest functionalities is a WhatsApp bot that takes delivery orders in Colombia and Mexico. The bot is fully integrated with our kitchens, helping guarantee speed and accuracy. We plan a rollout to more markets in the coming months to capture the potential of a much larger addressable market since WhatsApp is widely used in Latin America. On the logistic side on delivery is operating in almost 600 restaurants in six countries. Solutions include restaurant crew members delivering orders over very short distances, and third-party last-minute operators executing the delivery.This will help us further develop and monetize these new consumptionication in our markets. The unmatched physical presence of freestanding restaurants in the Arcos Dorados footprint has undoubtedly been the foundation of the last five consecutive record quarters. But it should also be a testament to the significant competitive advantage we have with our digital ecosystem. The junction of these two platforms into a seamless free digital experience is fueling our market share leadership. Using Brazil as a proxy, there has been a permanent shift in guest volume to off-premise channels. Meanwhile, on- premise traffic has improved steadily since 2020, which contributed to a moderation in Drive-Thru traffic growth this year, month delivery volume and total sales are both up this year, driving 29% sales growth in Brazil, despite a relatively flat industry trend.Our strategy to drive revenue through volume growth is clearly reflected in the quarter's visit share metrics. Total visit share increased by 3.1 percentage points versus the prior year quarter, while delivery visit share rose by four percentage points. Even with the results we are generating, there are still so many opportunities to improve operational performance. And that's why I am excited about what is yet to come.

According to a December survey of 38 economists per Bloomberg, there's a 70% probability the U.S. economy will enter into a recession in 2023.As a result of the expected economic slowdown next year, there is a higher likelihood of lower than expected earnings for the broader market in 2023.Because the market is future looking, broader market valuations have already decreased substantially in 2022. As of the indexes year to date as of December 26, the S&amp;P 500 is down 19.84% and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 33.70%. Even the blue chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated 9.24% in 2022.Many stocks do not do well if company earnings significantly underperform and outlook dissapoints. If earnings and outlook misses substantially, many analysts also lower their future estimated earnings, which can potentially lower valuations further in some instances.Blue Chip CompaniesBlue chips are companies who have substantial competitive advantages that often also have a strong financial history of profitability. Many blue chips have a long history of returning capital back to shareholders via dividends or stock repurchases.While blue chips as a whole have done better than the broader market, some blue chips have not done as well for various reasons.Some blue chips in the tech sector have underperformed because the higher inflation has put pressure on the ad market which has led to slower growth. Many big tech blue chips have also seen their valuations decline given capital has moved from tech to U.S. government bonds considering the rising interest rates.Story continuesIf economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside in the near term. For the quality blue chip companies that grow their earnings, however, there's upside in the long term.

If you want to see more dividend stocks that are down over 30% YTD, go directly to 5 Dividend Stocks That Are Down Over 30% YTD.Dividend stocks have been under pressure given rising Treasury yields.As a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates seven times this year, the U.S. 3 Month government Treasury bond has increased by 4.24 percentage points to 4.24% from 1 year ago. Meanwhile the 10 year Treasury bond has increased by 2.24 percentage points in a year to 4.13% and the 30 year Treasury bond has increased by 189 percentage points to 3.80%.Given the rising Treasury rates, many investors have decided to invest more in the U.S. government bonds than in dividend stocks. As a result, many dividend stocks haven't done very well this year.While Treasuries don't have any default risk, the longer term U.S. government bond securities do have potential downside if interest rates rise more than expected.U.S. government bonds also may not have as much upside as some of the leading dividend stocks such as ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) that have quality businesses and competitive advantages.In the long term, the Federal Reserve could also win its battle against inflation and interest rates could decrease. If interest rate expectations decrease, leading dividend stocks could become more attractive to many yield seeking investors again.Given the downturn this year and the expected economic recession next year, the broader market has declined substantially and many dividend stocks have fallen significantly as well. Given the uncertainty, it can be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.SemiconductorPhoto by Yogesh Phuyal on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Dividend Stocks That Are Down Over 30% YTD, we picked 12 stocks that pay dividends that are down over 30% year to date as of 12/26 according to FINVIZ.com.Story continuesSome stocks on this list, but not all, are leaders in their fields with quality businesses and competitive advantages.

316,714049f7-22a4-3108-9bcd-3499ed5633dd,TROW,2022-12-28,Is T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Growth (TRSGX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-personal-strategy-120012260.html,1672228812,STORY,"['TROW', '^GSPC']","[There are plenty of choices in the Mutual Fund Equity Report category, but where should you start your research? Well, one fund that may not be worth investigating is T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Growth (TRSGX). TRSGX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerT. Rowe Price is based in Baltimore, MD, and is the manager of TRSGX. Since T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Growth made its debut in July of 1994, TRSGX has garnered more than $1.68 billion in assets. The fund is currently managed by Charles Shriver who has been in charge of the fund since May of 2011.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 5.28%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 4.43%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. TRSGX's standard deviation over the past three years is 17.16% compared to the category average of 16.9%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 14.9% compared to the category average of 14.8%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsThe fund has a 5-year beta of 0.78, so investors should note that it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&amp;P 500. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -3.45. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, TRSGX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.61% compared to the category average of 0.78%. So, TRSGX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $2,500, and each subsequent investment should be at least $100.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Growth ( TRSGX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Growth ( TRSGX ) looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.For additional information on the Mutual Fund Equity Report area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

For more companies that sometimes end up employing more than a million people, head on over to 5 Biggest Employers in the World. Employment or the number of people that have a full time job is a crucial factor for any economy. Growth in employment, and the corresponding fall in unemployment, signals economic progress as more people have more money available to make purchases. However, as has been evident this year, too much employment often ends up worrying policymakers as well, since it can contribute to inflation and end up permanently increasing prices.The biggest example of this factor is the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike cycle for 2022. Throughout the course of this year, the Fed has raised the rate at which banks can lend money to each other in order to bring down inflation. As part of its decision making process, the central bank has been on the lookout for several metrics, one of which is the employment rate. The importance of unemployment to inflation was summed up by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Mr. Jerome Powell, who in a speech in late November at the Brookings Institution, outlined that:Finally, the labor market, which is especially important for inflation in core services ex housing, shows only tentative signs of rebalancing, and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.The Fed, as counterintuitive as it sounds, is hoping for unemployment to rise and job growth to reduce in order to slow down the economy and ensure that inflation in the U.S. comes down to the 2% goal. It isn't alone in this fight, and the Bank of England, in a recent statement tied together the link between higher costs, higher wages, low unemployment, and then higher prices, as part of a vicious cycle when it outlined:Story continuesThere is also pressure on prices from developments in the United Kingdom. Businesses are charging more for their products because of the higher costs they face. There are more job vacancies than there are people to fill them, as fewer people are seeking work following the pandemic. That means that employers are having to offer higher wages to attract job applicants. Prices for services have risen markedly.Today we will take a look at which companies are the largest employers in the world, but, if we were to include government bodies in our list too then you'd find that the United States Department of Defense (DoD) is one of the largest employers all around with a 2.9 million strong workforce. Other large government employers are the People's Liberation Army of China and the Russian Ministry of Defense. However, on the corporate side of things, some examples are Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Volkswagen AG (FRA:VOW3.DE). These companies are set to benefit over the next decade as improvements in machine learning and robotics will reduce their reliance on human labor.20 Biggest Employers in the WorldCopyright: rafaelbenari / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We used publicly available data from some of the largest firms to determine their employee base.

(NYSE:UPS) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-177-time-put-united-140021546.html,1672149621,STORY,['UPS'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine United Parcel Service’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service What's The Opportunity In United Parcel Service?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 1.11% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy United Parcel Service today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $175.06, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that United Parcel Service’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from United Parcel Service?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 1.4% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for United Parcel Service, at least in the short term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? UPS’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UPS, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) will pay a dividend of $0.50 on the 25th of January. The dividend yield will be 3.4% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. View our latest analysis for NetApp NetApp's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, NetApp's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 26.7%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 47%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendNetApp Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.60 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that NetApp has been growing its earnings per share at 24% a year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.NetApp Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. To that end, NetApp has 2 warning signs (and 1 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 71% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of PPL, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for PPL ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PPL?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in PPL. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PPL's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PPL. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.1% by the third-largest shareholder.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PPLThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of PPL Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$11m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over PPL. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

MDLZ has been benefiting from a focus on its chocolate and biscuit business. Also, strength in emerging markets and pricing has been working well for the company amid rising cost inflation and foreign currency headwinds.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 15.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 11.5%.Let’s delve deeper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFocus on Core BusinessesMondelez has been expanding its snacking category in particular. As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.To this end, Mondelez has been keen on expanding its business through acquisitions. In its third-quarter earnings release, the company noted that it closed the Ricolino buyout, which is expected to double the size of its Mexico business. In August 2022, it closed the buyout of Clif Bar.Management announced incremental investments in the Cocoa Life program and expanded its target to source all cocoa volumes from Cocoa Life by 2030. MDLZ concluded the integration of Chipita S.A. business, which was acquired in January 2022 and is a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from this acquisition boosted net revenues in the quarter under review.The company also inked a deal to divest its developed-market gum business (in the United States, Canada and Europe, excluding France) to Perfetti Van Melle Group, a renowned European maker of gum and confectionery products. The strategy aims at generating 90% of the company’s revenues from chocolates and biscuits (including baked snacks).Emerging Market Strength &amp; PricingMondelez remains encouraged by the underlying emerging market strength. In the third quarter of 2022, revenues from emerging markets increased 19.7% to $3,094 million while rising 24.4% on an organic basis. Management noted that Brazil, Mexico, Western India, the Middle East and North Africa delivered a solid performance.   Robust pricing actions have been aiding MDLZ. In the third quarter of 2022, pricing actions boosted organic net revenue growth and offered partial respite to the company’s adjusted gross profit margin and adjusted operating margin, which were otherwise hurt by cost inflation and an adverse mix.In its third-quarter earnings release, Mondelez stated that to mitigate the impact of input cost inflation, it has implemented price increases across key markets, including Europe. Mondelez also revealed plans to implement another round of price increases worldwide, including the United States, which is likely to be effective from December 2022.We believe that the aforementioned upsides are likely to help Mondelez counter challenges like input cost inflation. For 2022, management expects organic net revenue growth of more than 10%. Further, MDLZ envisions a 10% increase in adjusted earnings per share at cc.Story continuesOther Food Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Campbell Soup CPB and McCormick &amp; Company MKC.Conagra Brands, which operates as a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 largest healthcare companies by market cap.Competition should always be encouraged in the business world. After all, competition breeds innovation and innovation results in better advancements that improve the quality of our lives. The improvement in standard of living in just the past few decades is incredible and versus the previous century, it is almost unthinkable how far humanity has progressed.However, it is a debatable topic that some industries should be regulated more by the governments and shouldn't be for profit. One of these industries is the healthcare industry, where literally the lives of people are on the line. In most of the developed countries in the world, healthcare is regulated by the government, with socialized healthcare available to its citizens and residents. In fact, the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where the healthcare industry is for-profit, which is why 11 of the 15 largest healthcare companies by market cap are located in the U.S.15 largest healthcare companies by market capPhoto by CDC on UnsplashOn one hand, allowing the healthcare industry to remain for-profit allows for greater competition and innovation, as companies are highly motivated to invest in and develop new solutions to problems. Many of the advancements made in the healthcare industry come from the U.S. which is also the most technologically advanced country in the world precisely because of the high level of competition and freedom allowed to companies operating within the country, as compared to Western Europe, where focus is higher on consumer rights and companies have to comply with strict regulations that can stifle innovation, and be detrimental to consumers as companies do not have the same level of freedom to operate and developed new technologies. On the other hand, allowing companies freehand to do as they please is a recipe for disaster as well, as profits need to be balanced with the benefit to the general population. This is one place where the U.S. has struggled, with healthcare companies often raising prices significantly enough that if you don't have private insurance, even a normal routine procedure can result in your life savings being drained at a moment's notice.Story continuesThe global healthcare industry, according to The Business Research Company, was worth $6.8 trillion in 2021 and was expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% to reach $7.5 trillion in 2022, which shows that there is a lot of potential for growth in the industry and identifying the companies leading this growth is important in making the best possible investment decisions. Innovation is the driver of success and according to fDi Intelligence, the healthcare industry is among the most innovative industries in the world. Many of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world are among the biggest R&amp;D spenders in the world, while from our list of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap, Siemens Healthineers is one of the highest spenders on R&amp;D, with 2020 expenses exceeding $1.5 billion, which was 9% of the company's total revenue.In the U.S., since universal healthcare does not exist, even a simple procedure can cost tens of thousands of dollars, which in a country where the federal minimum wage is $7.5 an hour, can easily bankrupt someone who doesn't have private insurance. And people who are on the low end of the totem pole in the corporate world or unemployed are more likely not to have insurance. The reason prices are so exorbitant is that insurance companies then haggle with hospitals or healthcare providers to reduce the charges, and a common price is agreed. While this is great news for healthcare companies, and this is why many of them earn hundreds of millions of dollars in profits if not billions, it is not as good for the actual patients, who have the added stress and tension of trying to pay off a bill with savings that they don't have.The presence of technology is ever-increasing in the healthcare industry, and if you're considering which companies have the highest potential for growth, just take a look at the companies increasingly adapting cutting-edge technology to provide innovative solutions in the industry. According to Forbes, the rate of technology adoptions in the healthcare industry increased significantly during the pandemic. More and more hospitals are implementing technological solutions. What seems run of the mill now was once groundbreaking technology, including IV pumps, patient monitors, ventilators and more. Correct implementation of technology will increase efficiency, which in turn means that the benefits of current resources will be maximized and hence, the bottom line will improve. It will be interesting to see in a few years which of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap utilize technology correctly to increase market share and their grip on an extremely profitable industry (see 10 best healthcare dividend stocks to buy).The healthcare segment has various divisions, which includes health insurance, pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare services providers and medical equipment among others.

SBH is benefiting from a growing e-commerce business. The beauty products provider benefits from strength in its strategic growth pillars and is undertaking prudent buyouts to fuel growth. However, the company faces escalated cost inflation and supply chain-related issues.Let’s delve deeper.Online Business Aids GrowthSally Beauty is undertaking a number of efforts to augment its robust omnichannel platform. Robust investments to enhance the digital space are yielding. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, global e-commerce sales, at constant currency (cc), rose 30% to $90 million, contributing 9.3% to total consolidated net sales. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that e-commerce has started to comprise a bigger portion of the business as it continues to scale digital capabilities and utilize new tools and resources to fuel customer engagement. Sally Beauty Supply’s (SBS) e-commerce sales at cc grew 20% to $33 million, reflecting 6% of segment net sales. In the Beauty Systems Group (BSG), e-commerce sales at cc jumped 37% to $57 million, contributing 13.9% to the segment’s net sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else is Driving Growth?The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is focused on its four strategic growth pillars to boost the top line. These include leveraging the digital platform, driving loyalty and personalization, undertaking product innovation and enhancing the supply chain. In this regard, the company is making progress in loyalty and personalization. During fiscal 2022, management made several product innovations in the Sally and BSG segments.Beginning in fiscal 2023, Sally Beauty will leverage its omni-channel capabilities and modern retail infrastructure to aid growth. Management is on track to focus on its three key strategic initiatives, which include enhancing customer centricity, growing high-margin-owned brands and carrying out innovations while increasing the efficiency of operations and optimizing its capabilities. Talking about store optimization, management has been piloting store closures in several markets to maximize the value of its large store portfolio and provide a seamless omni-channel experience to its customers.Sally Beauty intends to strengthen its business on the back of strategic acquisitions. In September 2020, Sally Beauty’s subsidiary BSG acquired La Maison Ami-Co Inc. — a professional beauty products distributor in the Canadian province of Quebec. The deal augments its business in Quebec along with increasing the reach of BSG’s professional beauty products in its Chalut store network as well as full-service business.Story continuesIs All Rosy for Sally Beauty?Sally Beauty continued to battle inflationary pressures and supply chain headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share, down from 64 cents in the year-ago quarter. Consolidated net sales of $962.5 million dropped 2.8%. Comparable sales were in line with the year-ago quarter’s levels. The adverse impact of inflationary pressures influencing consumer behavior and supply chain challenges at Beauty Systems Group was a deterrent.In the quarter, Sally Beauty’s consolidated gross profit came in at $463.5 million, down 7.5% from $501 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted gross margin contracted 60 basis points (bps) to 50.1% due to the sales mix shift between Sally Beauty and Beauty Systems Group and increased distribution and freight costs in both units. In fact, management expects the external environment to remain challenging in the future. Certainly, rising inflationary pressure has been altering consumer spending and increasing labor costs.That being said, let’s see if the aforementioned upsides can help SBH counter these hurdles.The company’s stock has gained 2.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 18.1% growth.3 Solid Retail BetsWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, Dillard's, Inc.

The company’s fiscal third-quarter gross profit margin was 29.1%, down 0.4 percentage points. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that for modeling purposes, it is currently projecting nearly 130 bps of incremental freight expense and 70 bps of additional wage costs for fiscal 2023.We believe that the upsides mentioned above will likely keep driving The TJX Companies’ growth.Eye These Solid Retail PicksWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks — Dillard's, Inc.

339,adc20abf-ba64-3a17-942f-25d70789d5fb,VRTX,2022-12-28,Subdued Growth No Barrier To Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's (NASDAQ:VRTX) Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/subdued-growth-no-barrier-vertex-110009466.html,1672225209,STORY,['VRTX'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 22.5x Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Vertex Pharmaceuticals certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Vertex Pharmaceuticals' to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 52% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 52% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 9.1% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.3% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.In light of this, it's curious that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E?Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.We've established that Vertex Pharmaceuticals currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower.

(NYSE:TXT) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-textron-inc-nyse-145750469.html,1672066670,STORY,['TXT'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Textron’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Textron What Is Textron Worth?According to my valuation model, Textron seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Textron today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $85.75, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Textron’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Textron generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Textron's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 23%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TXT’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TXT, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Textron mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Coca-Cola (KO) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Coke currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 75% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for KOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for KOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Coke here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Coke, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is KO a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.48.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:WM) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Waste Management has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Waste Management will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Waste Management would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 31% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 32% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 11% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.3% per year, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's curious that Waste Management's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Waste Management's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Waste Management's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.You always need to take note of risks, for example - Waste Management has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Waste Management.

350,97864cb8-0f55-3437-9ffe-c701e5f1b3f7,SYK,2022-12-28,15 Largest Healthcare Companies by Market Cap,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-healthcare-companies-market-144221381.html,1672152141,STORY,"['ISRG', 'HCA', 'CNC', 'BSX', 'SYK', 'MDT', 'BDX']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 largest healthcare companies by market cap. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 largest healthcare companies by market cap.Competition should always be encouraged in the business world. After all, competition breeds innovation and innovation results in better advancements that improve the quality of our lives. The improvement in standard of living in just the past few decades is incredible and versus the previous century, it is almost unthinkable how far humanity has progressed.However, it is a debatable topic that some industries should be regulated more by the governments and shouldn't be for profit. One of these industries is the healthcare industry, where literally the lives of people are on the line. In most of the developed countries in the world, healthcare is regulated by the government, with socialized healthcare available to its citizens and residents. In fact, the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where the healthcare industry is for-profit, which is why 11 of the 15 largest healthcare companies by market cap are located in the U.S.15 largest healthcare companies by market capPhoto by CDC on UnsplashOn one hand, allowing the healthcare industry to remain for-profit allows for greater competition and innovation, as companies are highly motivated to invest in and develop new solutions to problems. Many of the advancements made in the healthcare industry come from the U.S. which is also the most technologically advanced country in the world precisely because of the high level of competition and freedom allowed to companies operating within the country, as compared to Western Europe, where focus is higher on consumer rights and companies have to comply with strict regulations that can stifle innovation, and be detrimental to consumers as companies do not have the same level of freedom to operate and developed new technologies. On the other hand, allowing companies freehand to do as they please is a recipe for disaster as well, as profits need to be balanced with the benefit to the general population. This is one place where the U.S. has struggled, with healthcare companies often raising prices significantly enough that if you don't have private insurance, even a normal routine procedure can result in your life savings being drained at a moment's notice.Story continuesThe global healthcare industry, according to The Business Research Company, was worth $6.8 trillion in 2021 and was expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% to reach $7.5 trillion in 2022, which shows that there is a lot of potential for growth in the industry and identifying the companies leading this growth is important in making the best possible investment decisions. Innovation is the driver of success and according to fDi Intelligence, the healthcare industry is among the most innovative industries in the world. Many of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world are among the biggest R&amp;D spenders in the world, while from our list of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap, Siemens Healthineers is one of the highest spenders on R&amp;D, with 2020 expenses exceeding $1.5 billion, which was 9% of the company's total revenue.In the U.S., since universal healthcare does not exist, even a simple procedure can cost tens of thousands of dollars, which in a country where the federal minimum wage is $7.5 an hour, can easily bankrupt someone who doesn't have private insurance. And people who are on the low end of the totem pole in the corporate world or unemployed are more likely not to have insurance. The reason prices are so exorbitant is that insurance companies then haggle with hospitals or healthcare providers to reduce the charges, and a common price is agreed. While this is great news for healthcare companies, and this is why many of them earn hundreds of millions of dollars in profits if not billions, it is not as good for the actual patients, who have the added stress and tension of trying to pay off a bill with savings that they don't have.The presence of technology is ever-increasing in the healthcare industry, and if you're considering which companies have the highest potential for growth, just take a look at the companies increasingly adapting cutting-edge technology to provide innovative solutions in the industry. According to Forbes, the rate of technology adoptions in the healthcare industry increased significantly during the pandemic. More and more hospitals are implementing technological solutions. What seems run of the mill now was once groundbreaking technology, including IV pumps, patient monitors, ventilators and more. Correct implementation of technology will increase efficiency, which in turn means that the benefits of current resources will be maximized and hence, the bottom line will improve. It will be interesting to see in a few years which of the biggest healthcare companies in the world by market cap utilize technology correctly to increase market share and their grip on an extremely profitable industry (see 10 best healthcare dividend stocks to buy).The healthcare segment has various divisions, which includes health insurance, pharmaceutical manufacturers, healthcare services providers and medical equipment among others. We excluded pharmaceutical companies from our ranking as they would absolutely dominate the list otherwise and claim four out of the top five positions. If you want to see the biggest drug companies in the world, please have a look here. To determine the market cap of the largest healthcare companies, we checked their market cap from Yahoo Finance, converting to USD the market cap of companies which were based outside the U.S. Just the 15 largest healthcare companies in the world have a market cap of over $1.1 trillion!

""Because of its scale, location and permitting status, Port Arthur LNG is benefitting from a lot of commercial momentum with nearly all the projected off-take capacity for Phase 1 now under long-term agreements with some of the leading global energy companies. Today's announcement moves us one step further along in the process of making Port Arthur LNG a reality.""""Our partnership with Sempra Infrastructure, one of the leading companies for LNG infrastructure in the US, is another important step to diversify Germany's gas supply and thus contributes to enhancing security of supply in Europe on a long-term basis,"" said Andree Stracke, CEO of RWE Supply &amp; Trading. ""Thanks to the LNG supply contract with Sempra Infrastructure, we can also enlarge our international LNG portfolio.""Sempra Infrastructure recently announced it has entered into long-term agreements with ConocoPhillips, INEOS and ENGIE for the sale and purchase of approximately 7.3 Mtpa of LNG from the proposed Phase 1 project. The company is focused on completing the remaining steps necessary to achieve its goal of making a final investment decision for Phase 1 of the liquefaction project in the first quarter of 2023, with first cargo deliveries expected in 2027.Story continuesThe Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project is permitted and expected to include two natural gas liquefaction trains and LNG storage tanks and associated facilities capable of producing, under optimal conditions, up to approximately 13.5 Mtpa of LNG. A similarly sized Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project is also competitively positioned and under active marketing and development.Development of both phases of the Port Arthur LNG project is contingent upon completing the required commercial agreements, securing and/or maintaining all necessary permits, obtaining financing, and reaching a final investment decision, among other factors.About Sempra Infrastructure Sempra Infrastructure delivers energy for a better world.

354,91a37057-894f-39f0-84f7-df2b74fb0220,GE,2022-12-28,"With 72% ownership, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/72-ownership-general-electric-company-130018072.html,1672232418,STORY,['GE'],"[If you want to know who really controls General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 72% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of General Electric. See our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in General Electric. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of General Electric, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. General Electric is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Capital Research and Management Company is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 7.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 13 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that General Electric Company insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$221m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over General Electric. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Both indexes, in fact, posted their third consecutive weekly decline. However, the Dow managed to gain 0.9%.U.S. stocks continued to gyrate for most of December and dashed hopes of a Santa Claus Rally. Investors remained worried that the Federal Reserve’s tightening measures could push the economy into a downturn.The Fed increased interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) earlier this month. This followed four successive 75-bps hikes in an effort to tame the multi-decade high inflation.What’s more, the Fed has pledged to keep hiking rates in 2023 as the economy still exhibits strength, leading to a possibility of an increase in consumer outlays.With the Fed positioned to remain hawkish in the near term, the market is subject to bouts of volatility.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

Allergan’s acquisition has diversified AbbVie’s revenue base into new therapeutic areas, enhancing its long-term growth potential.However, there are concerns about long-term sales growth once Humira generics enter the U.S. market.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Oil Companies in the World. While as a whole, 2022 has been a difficult year for business, as firms have struggled with high costs and rising interest rates, some industries have fared much better than others due to to the tumultuous global economic environment. One such industry is the oil industry, which saw renewed interest after the push to renewables had ended up reducing its prospects and favorability among investors.The Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in tough sanctions against Russia by the U.S. government which aimed to stem the flow of funds to Moscow so that it couldn't fund its war. The Americans were followed by the British, who also banned all Russian hydrocarbon imports, with the European Union also pitching in by announcing a plan to reduce the imports. The sanctions however led to a meteoric rise in crude oil prices, as all those who stopped buying Russian oil had to look elsewhere to meet their energy demands. Brent crude oil prices, which were already rising before February due to the post pandemic recovery, soared to a massive $139 per barrel in March.Naturally, the higher the price of your product, the more profit you make, and oil companies bathed in billions of dollars of profits this year.

(NYSE:BP), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) raked in $20 billion, $11 billion, $9.5 billion, and $8 billion in net income, which is the amount available to the firm after all of its expenses have been taken out. Saudi Aramco, which is one of the world's largest oil companies, brought in another $42 billion. These profits were met by criticism from the U.S. administration, who asked the American companies to increase their production in order to bring the prices down. However, the oil companies, beholden to their shareholders, did not increase capacity, countering that any capacity increase today will yield results years into the future - when oil will be much cheaper than it is today.Story continuesHowever, with 2022 coming to an end, crude oil prices have now reversed most of their gains and even entered into negative territory in late November. Primary reasons for this are the worries of a recession in the U.S. and other advanced economies and the Chinese struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic three years after the first case was reported.Today we will look at the biggest oil companies in the world, with the notable picks being Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation (SHA:600028.SS)20 Biggest Oil Companies in the WorldPhoto by David Thielen on UnsplashOur Methodology We studied the oil industry to sift out the largest firms in terms of their revenue.

You can skip our overview and go directly to the 5 Best Stocks In Each Sector.When it comes to investing in the stock market, having a diversified portfolio certainly does wonders for long-term investors. There is an old adage, ""Don't put all of your eggs in one basket,"" and it is often quoted by legendary investors like Warren Buffett, underscoring the importance of having a diversified portfolio.What is diversification, you may ask? Diversification involves mitigating risk by investing in a variety of relatively less correlated assets/industries. Diversification can greatly help to reduce risk and improve the potential for long-term returns. When it comes to investment in the stock market, diversification can be achieved by investing in a range of stocks from different sectors, industries, and geographic regions.There are several benefits to diversification in stock investing:Risk reduction: By spreading investments across a variety of stocks, the risk of loss is reduced as the performance of one stock is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall portfolio. This is because the returns of different stocks tend to be uncorrelated, meaning they are not influenced by the same factors.Improved returns: While diversification may reduce the risk of loss, it can also potentially lead to improved returns over the long term. This is because a diversified portfolio is more likely to capture the overall performance of the market rather than being reliant on the performance of a single stock or sector.Flexibility: Diversification allows investors to adjust their portfolios to changing market conditions by adding or removing stocks as needed. This flexibility can help investors to capitalize on opportunities and minimize potential losses.Warren Buffett famously made a bet on the S&amp;P500 that the market index would beat the returns generated through active investing by hedge fund managers. To no surprise, Warren Buffett came out as a winner as no hedge fund was able to beat the market from the period of January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017.Story continuesAlthough 2022 was not a good year for the stock market in general, there were certain sectors that generated high returns for investors. Energy stocks, for example, soared as oil and gas prices skyrocketed after the war in Ukraine and the increased global demand. In 2022, The S&amp;P 500 Energy Index returned a whopping 63% to investors, including dividends. Value stocks provided solid returns to investors as growth stocks came under pressure from the rising interest rates. The S&amp;P 500 Value Index, although is down 5.1% YTD on a total return basis, it outperformed the broader S&amp;P 500 index substantially, which is down ∼20% YTD.Our MethodologyTo come up with 11 best stocks in each sector, we have picked the most popular stock amongst hedge funds from each industry outlined by the MSCI.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -1.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has lost 0% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $5.17 per share, indicating a change of +15.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $22.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.89 indicates a change of +13.1% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $82.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $323.81 billion and $358.08 billion estimates indicate +12.6% and +10.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $80.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%. EPS of $5.79 for the same period compares with $4.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.21%. The EPS surprise was +6.24%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

366,dba5feab-d3d7-380a-941c-6c69d1154aee,PG,2022-12-28,Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-procter-gamble-130042724.html,1672146042,STORY,['PG'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.4bUS$15.0bUS$16.0bUS$17.4bUS$18.2bUS$18.8bUS$19.4bUS$19.9bUS$20.4bUS$20.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.42%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.47%Est @ 2.33% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$12.6kUS$13.2kUS$13.3kUS$13.6kUS$13.3kUS$13.0kUS$12.5kUS$12.1kUS$11.6kUS$11.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$126bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$478bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$478b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$256bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$383b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$153, the company appears about fair value at a 5.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Procter &amp; Gamble as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Procter &amp; GambleStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Procter &amp; Gamble, we've compiled three additional items you should assess:Risks: As an example, we've found 1 warning sign for Procter &amp; Gamble that you need to consider before investing here.Future Earnings: How does PG's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Since then, we have continued to refine our efforts to identify and close pay gaps based on gender, race and ethnicity. The 86% of our workforce that is covered by collective bargaining agreements has built-in pay equity as part of those agreements. Therefore, we have focused on pay equity for the remaining 14%, made up of management and support staff, who do not belong to unions.After engaging a labor and economics firm to support our pay equity analysis, American began deploying Syndio's workplace equity platform in 2020. Through Syndio's guidance, we fine-tuned our methodology and successfully completed pay equity reviews through 2021. Our approach begins by placing team members in one of 50 ""similarly situated groups"" (SSGs) across American based on the type of work they do. We then identify factors that can impact compensation within each SSG, such as an individual's seniority, experience or pay scale. Of course, higher salaries awarded to any new or existing team members can result in unintended pay gaps. By running a pay analysis at key points throughout the year, we can identify any drift in pay equity and address it. (See box above.)In 2021, American also became the first airline - and one of only a handful of large U.S. companies - to receive Fair Pay Workplace's inaugural pay equity certification. This Seattlebased nonprofit is working to dismantle pay disparities based on gender, race and ethnicity to create sustained fair pay. Our certification means that American has committed to apply valid methods for identifying pay equity issues and for implementing an ongoing remediation plan over time. As such, our rules and standards are available to the public.The Fair Pay Workplace certification applies specifically to our management and support staff teams. Among our certification requirements, American will undergo regular check-ins that involve a seven-point review of our remediation plan. We have also pledged not to ask job candidates about their prior compensation or expectations for starting pay, which Fair Pay has identified as one of the largest sources of pay gaps.Story continuesRead moreAmerican Airlines, Tuesday, December 27, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from American Airlines on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: American AirlinesWebsite: profiles/american-airlinesEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: American AirlinesView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/733336/Building-on-a-Long-Standing-Commitment-to-Pay-Equity]"
369,1d50bcb0-1641-38d1-a879-f08bcb064684,ETN,2022-12-28,"With 84% ownership, Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/84-ownership-eaton-corporation-plc-130047390.html,1672232447,STORY,['ETN'],"[A look at the shareholders of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Eaton, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Eaton ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Eaton?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Eaton already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Eaton's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Eaton. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.9%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.9% and 5.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of EatonThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Eaton Corporation plc in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$209m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Eaton. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Eaton better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Eaton   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The stock is down -5.4% this year, roughly in-line with the Mastercard's -5.3% pullback, but significantly better than the -20.7% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. Visa is undoubtedly faced with a number of near-term challenges, but it is well positioned for long-term growth on the back of numerous buyouts and alliances. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payment to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.The gradual revival of the global economy will keep driving consumer spending, expanding V's business volumes in turn.

Further, a solid demand environment in the industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a major positive.Additionally, solid momentum across the Analog segment owing to robust signal chain and power product lines, is contributing well to the top line.

It has significant acreages in oil shale plays like Delaware, Bakken and Eagle Ford.The company estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations in those promising shale plays, brightening the production outlook.

372,5c08e619-60ef-3be3-a3ce-da8eb0d610ae,SHW,2022-12-28,The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sherwin-williams-company-nyse-shw-140015523.html,1672149615,STORY,['SHW'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sherwin-Williams is:75% = US$1.9b ÷ US$2.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.75 in profit.Does Sherwin-Williams Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Sherwin-Williams has a better ROE than the average (18%) in the Chemicals industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesSherwin-Williams' Debt And Its 75% ROEIt seems that Sherwin-Williams uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 4.06. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course Sherwin-Williams may not be the best stock to buy.

373,b036a9c6-dfb0-3957-b0cb-62ec080fa1ed,AWK,2022-12-28,7 Stocks to Buy Now Ahead of a Potentially Slow 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-now-ahead-210946410.html,1671916186,STORY,"['CVX', 'AWK', 'ALL-PG', 'MSFT', 'DLTR', 'COST', 'CL']","[Although the new year typically brings feelings of optimism, it’s probably time for investors to consider stocks to buy ahead of a potentially slow 2023. Not to be a downer but circumstances don’t appear particularly compelling for the bulls. At the top, global recession fears rise as multiple countries struggle with inflation and coronavirus-fueled disruptions.Closer to home, the Federal Reserve presents significant worries for market participants. Recently, the November jobs report came in hotter than expected. While typically a positive dynamic, the resultant framework – more dollars chasing after fewer goods – repudiated the central bank’s efforts to contain inflation through higher rates.Translation? More than likely, the Fed will double down on its hawkish monetary policies. And that means stocks to buy that feature stable or relevant businesses should outperform the others.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMSFTMicrosoft$238.73CVXChevron$177.40CLColgate-Palmolive$79.45ALLAllstate$136.37COSTCostco$462.65DLTRDollar Tree$141.91AWKAmerican Water Works$153.02Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comWhile consumer technology firms typically don’t represent stocks to buy for stability’s sake, an exception can be made for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Unlike your typical aspirational tech player, Microsoft has become fully integrated into everyday life. For instance, its Windows operating system dominates the desktop market. And although smart devices may dominate the retail segment, desktops still undergird professional operations.In other words, it’s difficult to be productive with a tablet no matter how cute it is. Further, with major enterprises announcing layoffs, people fluent in digital business architectures will likely succeed. Cynically but realistically, this dynamic puts Microsoft in the driver’s seat.Most importantly, solid all-around financials undergird MSFT stock. From a stable balance sheet to solid long-term revenue growth to a high-quality business profile, you can’t go wrong with Microsoft.Story continuesNot surprisingly, then, analysts love MSFT, rating it a consensus strong buy. Out of 28 of Wall Street’s experts, no one has a sell rating and only three stated that it’s a hold. Thus, MSFT is one of the stocks to buy ahead of a slow 2023.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWith Russia’s utterly shocking invasion of Ukraine, a lot has been made of the relevancies of hydrocarbon specialists such as Chevron (NYSE:CVX). One of the big oil firms, Chevron covers all the bases of the industry, ranging from upstream (exploration and production), midstream (storage and transportation), and downstream (refining and marketing). Naturally, CVX won big in 2022, gaining over 46% on a year-to-date basis.Still, questions surround the sustainability of Chevron and its ilk. With countries waking up to the dangers of energy dependency on unreliable partners, many fast-tracked renewable energy initiatives. The thing is, such projects will take time to implement. And some regions just don’t have the geographical or climate-based endowment to support renewable infrastructures.Therefore, CVX represents one of the stocks to buy for ongoing relevancies. To be fair, analysts have started to shy away from Chevron, rating it a consensus hold. Nevertheless, hedge funds – or smart money – built up their position in CVX significantly. In this case, I think they’re on the right path.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comOne of the more boring stocks to buy that you can think of, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) won’t get your blood flowing. However, boring is good during uncertain times. Primarily, Colgate-Palmolive benefits from inelastic demand. Stated differently, no matter what happens to the underlying products’ pricing, they benefit from consistent, predictable demand.For example, people should usually aim to brush their teeth three times a day, along with flossing at least once a day. Now, whether a recession materializes or not, dentists will still recommend a typical teeth-cleaning regimen. Further, with economic pressures building, some folks might skip a dental appointment or two – just like during the Covid-19 days.According to analysts, CL rates as a consensus moderate buy. It’s not the most confident of assessments: among 13 analysts, six rated it a buy, and seven rated it a hold. Nevertheless, generally rising interest among hedge funds makes Colgate an interesting potential candidate for stocks to buy.Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs you’ll see down below, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) doesn’t exactly win on every financial and investment metric. However, if you’re looking for stable stocks to buy, you shouldn’t ignore ALL (or its closest rivals). Since the start of the year, ALL returned nearly 14% of equity value for its stakeholders. In contrast, a theoretical share of the S&amp;P 500 during the same period would have netted you a 19% loss.I’ll take the 14%, thank you very much! Better yet, the framework should still be positive for ALL stock. Fundamentally, the underlying company benefits from a hostage audience. For instance, most states in the U.S. require auto insurance. Plus, with employers likely to force their workers to return to the office, the morning commute will be back. Cynically, this dynamic supports ALL as one of the stocks to buy.Now, while Gurufocus.com rates Allstate as modestly undervalued, you should be aware that its profit margins (on a trailing 12-month basis) sit in negative territory. Also, hedge funds dropped some exposure in the third quarter of this year. Still, Wall Street rates ALL as a consensus moderate buy.Costco (COST)Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession PickSource: ShutterstockWith circumstances cloudy for 2023, investors ought to consider warehouse-style retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) as one of the stocks to buy. Fundamentally, I appreciate how the business can easily adapt to varying circumstances.Let’s say that inflation continues to worsen next year despite the Fed’s best efforts to contain it. By logical deduction, Costco offers a practical mechanism to beat rising prices. Through bulk purchases, consumers can mitigate the erosion of the dollar’s purchasing power.On the other hand, if deflation becomes the norm, Costco has an answer to that too. With the company featuring a consumer demographic with a higher-than-average income, it caters to the affluent and upwardly mobile. Additionally, higher income usually equates to higher educational attainment, a positive during an economic downturn. Wall Street analysts also have the same idea, assigning COST a moderate buy consensus view. Out of 25 experts, 18 rated COST a buy while seven rated it a hold.Dollar Tree (DLTR)store front of a Dollar Tree location with green signageSource: shutterstock.com/Jonathan WeissDepending on how severe a potential slowdown might be in 2023, investors ought to consider Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) as a candidate for stocks to buy. Under the principle of the trade-down effect, consumers probably won’t drop from a top-tier retailer to a discount dollar store. Instead, they’ll taper down their purchases until finding a reasonable balance between price and quality.However, it’s also important to note that the biggest beneficiaries of the Covid-19 crisis were affluent. In other words, the widening wealth gap indicates that much of the country is hurting. Another major crisis could send blistering demand to Dollar Tree (and admittedly its ilk). Therefore, it might make sense to plan DLTR as one of the stocks to buy now. Presently, analysts rate Dollar Tree as a consensus moderate buy. However, it’s a tricky narrative. Among 15 experts, nine rated it a buy, five a hold, and one a sell. To be fair, hedge funds have also been limiting their exposure. Still, with price sensitivity likely to become a major issue, it’s worth keeping close tabs on DLTR.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comProbably the riskiest idea on this list of stocks to buy, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a public utility that specializes in water and water treatment services. Fundamentally, the business features relevance because of its underlying predictability. I’m not going to say it has the cleanest financials. However, water represents our most precious resource. Therefore, its management will only become more critical over time.Of course, the main distraction for AWK is its market loss. Since the start of the year, AWK dropped more than 17% in equity value. Quite frankly, the volatility is not that far removed from the aforementioned benchmark equity index. Still, in the trailing half-year period, AWK gained over 11%. And in the trailing month, shares swung up nearly 3%.To be fair, hedge funds reduced some of their exposure in Q3 this year (relative to Q2). Nevertheless, over the past several quarters, these institutional investors have been building a sizable position. Ultimately, then, AWK is one of the stocks to buy ahead of potential uncertainties.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

SYY, AbbVie ABBV, and PepsiCo Inc. PEP – could all be considerations for investors looking to reap a reliable income stream.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.Sysco Corp. Sysco markets and distributes a range of food and related products primarily to the food service or food-away-from-home industry.Sysco’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.5%, modestly below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average. Still, the company’s 8.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, it’s hard to ignore SYY’s growth profile; earnings are forecasted to soar 28% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 13% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 11.5% in FY23 and 4.2% in FY24.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAbbVieAbbVie enjoys leadership positions in key therapeutic areas, including immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics, eye care, and women’s health.AbbVie’s 3.5% annual dividend yield is well above its Zacks Medical Sector average of 1.4%. Further, ABBV carries a sustainable 41% payout ratio paired with an impressive 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also generates solid cash; ABBV generated roughly $7.4 billion in free cash flow in its latest quarter, representing a 52% sequential uptick.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCo Inc. PepsiCo is a long-established company engaged in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. Currently, the company sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).PEP’s annual dividend currently yields 2.5%, a few ticks below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average of 2.7%. Like SYY, PepsiCo’s 6.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCo has been on an impressive earnings streak as of late, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in each of its last three quarters. Just in its latest release, the company registered a 6.5% EPS beat and reported revenue 5.3% above expectations.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineDividends cushion the blow of losses in other positions, provide an additional way to earn a return on investment, and allow for maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.Dividend Aristocrats are common targets of income-focused investors, as these companies have successfully upped their dividend payouts for a minimum of 25 consecutive years.However, the Elite Dividend Kings group sits right above, which consists of companies increasing their payouts uninterrupted for a minimum of 50 consecutive years.Clearly, Dividend Kings, including Sysco Corp. SYY, AbbVie ABBV, and PepsiCo Inc. PEP, have all shown an unparalleled commitment to shareholders throughout their history.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) and Oracle Corporation (ORCL).

The company has succesfully expanded labels of its cancer drugs, Imbruvica and Venclexta. It has several new drugs in its portfolio, which have the potential to drive revenues once Humira loses U.S. exclusivity in 2023.Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories bolstered by the approval in new indications. It has several early/mid-stage candidates that have blockbuster potential. Allergan’s acquisition has diversified AbbVie’s revenue base into new therapeutic areas, enhancing its long-term growth potential.However, there are concerns about long-term sales growth once Humira generics enter the U.S. market. Increasing competition from newer therapies is hurting Imbruvica’s sales. Slowing consumer demand due to economic pressures is affecting aesthetics franchise sales.(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of PepsiCo have gained +6.9% over the past year, modestly lagging Coke's +9.5% gain, but handily outperforming the broader market's -21.2% decline. The company’s revenues and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year in the third quarter. This marked the 17th straight quarter of sales beat.PepsiCo benefits from the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. It expects to benefit by delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands. It raised its revenue view for 2022.However, PepsiCo witnessed margin pressures in the third quarter driven by impacts of supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs.

The Zacks analyst expect fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating expenses to jump 18.3% over fiscal 2022.Nevertheless, Oracle’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results benefitted from strength in infrastructure and applications cloud businesses. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM), bodes well.Solid demand for the Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is anticipated to drive the top line.

The increase in the top line was mainly driven by a strong pricing performance across the portfolio, continued growth in depletions and shipments for the Twisted Tea brand, and positive early progress in Hard Mountain Dew.However, depletions continue to be hurt by the slowdown in the hard seltzer business and supply-chain woes. Higher material and packaging costs and elevated inventory obsolescence costs  have been threats to  gross margin.Shares of Boston Beer have gained 0.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rise of 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s sales and earnings suggests declines of 0.8% and 44.8%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors to Drive GrowthSAM's focus on innovation to revive the Truly brand and expand Twisted Tea’s potential bodes well. Boston Beer is keen on bringing excitement to the Truly brand’s core flavors through innovation. The company’s innovation for the Truly brand — Truly flavored bottle Vodka — sold by Beam Suntory from the latter part of the first quarter of 2022, has been well-received by consumers. The company is optimistic about the Truly Vodka Seltzer launched in October 2022. With regard to revisiting the core flavors, the company announced the reformulation and improvement of core Truly flavors, including the addition of real fruit juice for an even smoother, easy-to-drink and refreshing taste.Coming to Twisted Tea, the brand drove most of the improvements of Boston Beer in the third quarter. Being one of the top 20 fastest-growing brands in all beer for the past 12 months, Twisted Tea grew in double digits and emerged as the number one in FMB in the third quarter by growing 4.3 share points. The rise was driven by the improved distribution of 12 packs, and a unique product and brand positioning that resonates with more consumers.We note that Boston Beer has made successful innovations in craft beer, and hard cider and iced tea categories over the years. The company is on track with growth of its Beyond Beer category, wherein it currently holds the 2nd position. Beyond Beer is growing faster than the traditional beer market, and the company expects the trend to continue for the next several years.The company is also focused on accelerated cost savings and efficiency projects to aid margins. The company’s gross margin expanded 1,250 basis points (bps) year over year to 43.2%. The rise mainly resulted from increased costs in third-quarter 2021 related to the slowdown in hard seltzer and gains from pricing in third-quarter 2022. Going forward, the company expects to offset the impacts of higher commodity costs through price increases.In third-quarter 2022, SAM’s operating expenses declined 11.7% year over year on lower advertising, promotional and selling expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. Advertising, promotional and selling expenses declined on lower brand investments, particularly media costs, and reduced freight to distributors due to lower freight rates. Consequently, the company’s operating income of $38.4 million improved from an operating loss of $75.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter.For 2022, the company expects investments in advertising, promotional and selling to decline $35-$45 million compared with a decrease of $30-$50 million mentioned earlier. The advertising, promotional and selling guidance does not assume any changes in freight costs for the shipment of products to its distributors.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeBoston Beer has been witnessing a slowdown in the hard seltzer category and the demand for the Truly brand in recent quarters. The slowing hard seltzer trends hurt the company’s depletions in third-quarter 2022. The Hard seltzer volume declined 17% in the third quarter and 15% for the nine months of 2022, in the measured off-premise channels. The hard seltzer category’s decelerating trend has mainly been attributed to the losing of novelty among consumers due to the entry of several beyond-beer products in the marketplace.Additionally, the decline has resulted from the ongoing dismal macroeconomic environment, which has caused a volume shift from hard seltzers to premium light beers due to their lower pricing. The slowed hard seltzer sales mainly impacted the company’s Truly hard seltzer performance, which is expected to continue through the rest of 2022.Boston Beer has been sensitive to changes in volume projections, mostly related to the hard seltzer category, supply-chain performance and inflationary impacts. It narrowed its 2022 view. For 2022, the company envisions adjusted earnings per share of $7.00-$10.00 compared with the $6.00-$11.00 mentioned earlier. Depletions and shipments are expected to decline 4-7% compared with a decrease of 2-8% stated earlier. The narrowed view mainly reflects expectations for continued gains in Twisted Tea and Hard Mountain Dew.The company expects the 53rd week to aid depletion and shipment growth rates for 2022 by 1-1.5 percentage points. Depletion and shipment growth rates for the fourth quarter are expected to record gains of 4-6 percentage points from the 53rd week.Boston Beer anticipates a gross margin of 42-43.5% for 2022 compared with the 43-45% mentioned earlier. The lowered guidance is a result of the impacts of higher inventory obsolescence, as well as lower brewery efficiencies due to the slowed ramp-up of the newly integrated variety pack lines. The company expects to offset the impacts of higher commodity costs through price increases.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, PepsiCo PEP and Ambev ABEV.Coca-Cola FEMSA produces, markets and distributes soft drinks throughout the metropolitan area of Mexico City in Southeastern Mexico and the metropolitan region in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Union Pacific is:60% = US$7.1b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.60 in profit.Does Union Pacific Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Union Pacific has a better ROE than the average (25%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesUnion Pacific's Debt And Its 60% ROEUnion Pacific does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.82. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Union Pacific may not be the best stock to buy.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Quest Diagnostics’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics What Is Quest Diagnostics Worth?Good news, investors! Quest Diagnostics is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 14.47x is currently well-below the industry average of 21.39x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. However, given that Quest Diagnostics’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Quest Diagnostics generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -1.8% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Quest Diagnostics. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although DGX is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to DGX, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on DGX for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.Ameriprise Financial (AMP) is a stock many investors are watching right now. AMP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.62. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 12.94. Over the last 12 months, AMP's Forward P/E has been as high as 57.02 and as low as 7.92, with a median of 10.53.AMP is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.61. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. AMP's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.81. Over the past 52 weeks, AMP's PEG has been as high as 0.77 and as low as 0.58, with a median of 0.65.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. AMP has a P/S ratio of 2.27. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.28.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that AMP has a P/CF ratio of 12.60. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 26.15. Over the past year, AMP's P/CF has been as high as 15.34 and as low as 7.92, with a median of 10.91.Janus Henderson Group (JHG) may be another strong Financial - Investment Management stock to add to your shortlist. JHG is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Furthermore, Janus Henderson Group holds a P/B ratio of 0.94 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 2.60. JHG's P/B has been as high as 1.60, as low as 0.77, with a median of 1 over the past 12 months.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Ameriprise Financial and Janus Henderson Group are likely being undervalued right now.

After four months as Interim President and CEO, I have even deeper conviction that we have a portfolio of iconic brands that our customers love, an increased confidence in our platform to drive leverage and economies of scale, and belief in this team's ability to deliver. We know where we've gotten things wrong and the team and I are at work to correct them. As I told you last quarter, we can and we should win in any environment and the management team and I continue to hold the company accountable to deliver on that. We've taken action to optimize profitability and cash flow, while rebalancing and reducing inventory to drive near and long-term improvements across our entire business.We've sharpened our focus on execution or bringing more rigor to our operations and are responding to what our customers are telling us with respect to trend. While our efforts drove sequential improvement during the quarter, our expectations are set on the consistency of execution quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year that we know is crucial to delivering the sustainable profitable growth and value that our people and shareholders expect. Let me provide an update on our progress during the quarter, starting with actions taken on cost. As I last shared, we are aggressively managing costs and have taken the state action in this quarter alone, resulting in roughly $250 million in estimated annualized savings. These actions include; the elimination of 500 existing and open roles in our corporate offices and a pause on hiring and contractor spend for the remainder of the year, resulting in $125 million in estimated annualized savings.Initially, the renegotiation of our advertising agency contracts, resulting in approximately $75 million in annualized savings; and a reduction in technology, operating costs and rationalized investments, resulting in estimated $50 million of annualized savings beginning in fiscal 2023. We are early in our work here and yet already these savings are expected to help offset higher incentive compensation and increasing labor costs in fiscal 2023. However, there is still work to be done to transform our cost structure and improve overall efficiency, so that we are fit for the future. Next, let me share more on our inventory actions and assortment rebalancing efforts. We continue to rely heavily on markdowns and discounting to sell-through reliable styles this quarter and have reduced receipts in Q4.These actions will allow us to enter fiscal 2023 in an improved inventory position, and beginning in Q1, our brands will benefit from our reinstated responsive capabilities to chase into product demand. We're seeing an improved balance in the assortment across the portfolio compared to the first half of the year. And each of our brands were better positioned in the categories that resonate with the base consumer preferences, and our customers rewarded us for that. We saw consistent category strength in dresses, sweaters, pants and woven tops across the portfolio, with active underperforming across the board, as consumers continue to shift away from the cozy at-home lifestyle. While Athleta isn't immune to the change in consumer preference, despite moderation of growth in the women's active market, the brand is showing strength in lifestyle categories like dresses and accessories that are demonstrating disproportionate growth in today's current environment.Now, let me take a moment and speak to each of our brands, starting with Old Navy. Old Navy delivered net sales growth of 2% over last year, showing early signs of improvement as the brand continues its efforts to right-size inventory, balance assortment, relevance and sizing across its channels. And the brand saw strength in its women's business in categories including pants, outerwear, sweaters and woven tops. All this was offset, however, by softness in active in kids and baby, as we lapped last year's strong demand, which we believe was driven in part by the US Child Tax credit and, of course, the heightened post-COVID back-to-school spending. Old Navy customers still have a propensity to buy. That being said, it continues to experience softness in spending and shopping frequency from its lowest income consumers.As we continue to attract a wide range of consumers, we still believe Old Navy is well positioned in the marketplace, particularly as consumers become more value-conscious. Next, Gap brand. Gap delivered net sales flat to last year and is seeing signs of strength in its core, with a significant shift in trend performance across its women's business. Iconic Gap store brands who were delivering in trend-right fabrics like faux leather and occasion-based categories like dresses, woven tops, sweaters and pants all drove comparable sales growth. Similar to Old Navy, Gap brand experienced softness in kids and baby and activewear overall. Over the last 18 months, Gap brand has successfully transitioned its France, Italy and UK businesses to franchise partners as part of our Partner to Amplify strategy.And last week, we signed agreement to transition the Gap Greater China business to Baozun Inc. who will operate our end market sites in stores under a franchise agreement, pending closing conditions and regulatory approval early next year. This strategy allows Gap brand to operate its businesses through a more asset-light, cost-effective model and to benefit from the local expertise of our partners. Moving to Banana Republic, we saw net sales growth of 8% compared to last year. September marked the one-year anniversary of their brand relaunch. Shifting from a highly promotional workwear brand catering to everybody, Banana Republic spent the last year reimagining every element of the customer journey, with a special focus on quality products, differentiated experiences, and relevant branding, positioning it as a premier lifestyle brand that enhances people's lives wherever they are.This accessible luxury differentiates Banana Republic from others at this price point and has brought in a more premium consumer. We hope that you'll take a look soon. During the quarter, Banana Republic experienced strong demand for suiting and its finer fabrics, including silk and cashmere. As post-pandemic consumer preferences began to balance from the current trend of occasion and workwear, it will be important that Banana Republic continues to use its unique customer proposition as a lifestyle brand to differentiate itself for years to come. Finally, on Athleta, Athleta delivered net sales growth of 6% compared to last year. While the women's activewear market has continued to be soft against the growth trajectory in the past few years, Athleta is holding share.As I mentioned last quarter, Athleta has made quick pivots to print and pattern as well as with their performance lifestyle product to better meet the customers' preferences. The new fall and holiday product is resonating well with the customer and Athleta saw growth in both bottoms and tops, the largest categories in the women's apparel market and key to the brand's long-term strategy. Before I pass it off to Katrina to share more details on our financials, let me end with how I began on the state of the business. I have no doubt, we have world-class brands that our customers love, and we drive value and scale through the synergy of our platform. But I'm also very clear that there is work to be done to right-size our cost structure, streamline inventory, and capitalize on our creative strengths to deliver the products and experience our customers deserve and employees and shareholders expect.Lastly, the Board remains active in its search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer. We're focused on a hands-on leader who can greatly increase our operating rigor, moving us past our deficiencies, while in parallel, enabling strong creative direction and brand architecture as they develop the vision for how our portfolio should evolve over time to create a sustainable business model. This is a great company with strong assets and one that demands a leader who can hold to its value and ensure it remains fit and capable of scaling its omni-platform and market leadership. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Katrina.See also David Tepper Stock Portfolio and 15 Biggest Copper Companies in the World.Katrina O'Connell: Thank you, Bobby and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Let me start with our third quarter results. Third quarter net sales of $4.04 billion increased 2% versus last year or 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by an improvement in trend relative to the first half of the year and in part due to the timing of franchise sales. Sales in the third quarter were 1% above pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Comparable sales were up 1% on top of negative 1% comp last year and a significant sequential improvement from the negative 10% comp last quarter, primarily as our assortment rebalancing efforts at Old Navy and Gap are starting to take hold and resonating with our customers as well as the benefit of an early holiday promotional event at Old Navy in October.Store sales increased 1% from the prior year. Year-to-date, we have closed a net total of 29 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America and now anticipate closing approximately 30 additional stores this year, bringing us to close to 90% of our goal of closing 350 stores in North America by the end of fiscal 2023. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2022, we remain on track to open a net 30 Athleta stores and now expect to open a net 10 Old Navy stores this year. Online sales increased 5% versus last year and represented 39% of total sales in the quarter. Compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, online sales increased 55%. Turning to sales by brand. Starting with Old Navy, sales in the third quarter of $2.1 billion were up 2% versus last year and increased 10% relative to pre-pandemic levels in 2019.Old Navy comparable sales were down 1%, representing a sequential improvement from the negative 15% comp last quarter, driven by improvements in category mix and a more balanced assortment that now includes more of the product that our customers have been looking for, as preferences have shifted from cozy casual to work occasion this year. However, we do believe that Old Navy did benefit from a slight pull-forward of sales from the fourth quarter into October, as a result of its efforts to get out earlier than typical with its first holiday promotional event. Gap brand global sales of $1.04 billion were flat versus last year, with global comparable sales up 4%, driven by improved category mix and a more balanced assortment, including more occasion-based and fast and driven categories, as well as comp growth in Asia as a result of lapping the outsized negative impact of COVID-related restrictions last year.North America comparable sales were flat, a sequential improvement from negative 10% last quarter. Banana Republic sales grew 8% from last year to $517 million, with comparable sales up 10%, as the brand continued to capitalize on the shift in consumer preference and the relaunch and elevated positioning of the brand last year. Athleta sales grew 6% to $340 million, or an increase of 57% compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Comparable sales improved sequentially to a flat comp in the third quarter, compared to negative 8% comp last quarter and negative 7% in the first quarter. As we look to sales in the fourth quarter, we continue to take a prudent approach, given the uncertain macro and consumer environment, as well as the competitive promotional environment.Also, as stated earlier, third quarter net sales benefited in part by the timing of franchise sales as well as the October holiday event at Old Navy. In addition, Gap brands will be up against an approximate 1 point headwind as we anniversaried Yeezy Gap sales last year that will not be in the base this year. As a result of these factors and the continued uncertain environment, we anticipate that total company sales in the fourth quarter could be down mid-single digits year-over-year. Now, to gross margin. Gross margin in the third quarter was 37.4%, deleveraging 470 basis points versus last year, inclusive of 130 basis points of deleverage related to a $53 million Yeezy Gap impairment charge. On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 38.7%, deleveraging 320 basis points versus last year as we continue to experience higher levels of markdowns in order to better position our inventory.Excluding the impairment related to Yeezy Gap, merch margin deleveraged 370 basis points as a result of higher discounting due to the previously communicated assortment imbalances as well as more aggressive focus on better positioning and clearing excess inventory as we exit fiscal 2022. Airfreight contributed approximately 200 basis points of leverage as spend levels normalized during the quarter and we lapped the $70 million of incremental air freight expense last year. Equally offsetting this was approximately 200 basis points of deleverage due to inflationary and commodity cost-related headwinds. Turning to ROD. We continue to benefit from our fleet restructuring efforts through lower ROD costs, which were relatively in line with last year on a nominal basis.Excluding a Yeezy Gap impairment charge, ROD as a percentage of sales leveraged approximately 50 basis points. As we look to gross margin in the fourth quarter, we will lap last year's $245 million of incremental airfreight, which is expected to add approximately 540 basis points to gross margin versus last year. We continue to anticipate an approximate 200 basis point inflationary and commodity cost headwinds and that ROD will likely be about flat as a percentage of sales versus last year. As we communicated last quarter, while we are taking actions to right-size inventory in an increasingly promotional environment, we continue to expect significant variability in discount rate. As a reminder, gross margin in the second and third quarters were impacted by approximately 370 basis points of deleverage stemming from higher discounting.Turning to SG&amp;A. Reported SG&amp;A was $1.3 billion or 32.8% of sales, leveraging 540 basis points from the prior year and includes an $83 million net benefit from the sale of our UK DC now that our European partnership model transition is complete. In addition, we recorded an immaterial amount of severance related to the overhead reductions taken in the third quarter. Adjusted SG&amp;A, excluding the UK DC benefit, decreased 5% versus last year to $1.4 billion. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&amp;A leveraged 280 basis points from the prior year's adjusted rate, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes, lower bonus accrual, and lower marketing expense compared to last year. As Bobby discussed, we've begun to take actions to right-size our cost structure and improve profitability, focusing acutely on areas where we may have invested without commensurate returns in recent years as it relates to overhead, marketing, and technology.We've already acted on approximately $250 million in annualized savings stemming from the reduction of approximately 500 existing and open corporate roles in the quarter, the renegotiation of advertising agency contracts and the reduction of technology operating costs and rationalization of digital investments. These actions will not have a material impact on SG&amp;A as we look to the fourth quarter as a result of timing and severance offsets, in addition to headwinds in the quarter related to higher seasonal labor costs relative to last year. However, these actions will provide a significant offset to the higher incentive compensation and wage inflation headwinds we anticipate in fiscal 2023. Reported operating income increased 22% to $186 million or 4.6% as a percentage of sales.Adjusted operating income decreased 8% from the prior year to $156 million. Adjusted operating margin of 3.9% was 40 basis points lower than last year's adjusted rate, reflecting the elevated promotional activity and higher inflationary costs, offset by the air freight leverage and the SG&amp;A leverage relative to last year. Moving to interest and taxes. We recognized $18 million in net interest expense, a $25 million savings versus last year due to the refinancing of our long-term debt last fall. During the quarter, we recorded an income tax benefit of $114 million on pre-tax income of $168 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 68%. This income tax benefit was related to the cumulative impact of a change in the estimated annual tax rate as a result of quarterly earnings variability.This year-to-date tax benefit is expected to reverse and result in at least $200 million of tax expense in the fourth quarter, offsetting the tax benefit on a fiscal year basis. Reported EPS was $0.77. Adjusted EPS, which excludes an approximate $0.18 net benefit related to the UK DC sale and a $0.12 negative impact due to the Yeezy Gap impairment charge was $0.71. Adjusted EPS includes $0.33 related to the tax benefit in the quarter. Share count ended at 365 million. Turning to balance sheet and cash flow, starting with inventory. We are making initial progress on our plan to right-size inventories and move to levels below last year by the end of the fiscal year. Our more aggressive markdowns combined with moderated holiday receipts drove a sequential improvement in the inventory growth during the quarter.Total ending inventory was up 12% versus last year, a sequential improvement from 37% inventory growth in the second quarter. The 12% year-over-year growth in the third quarter includes a 13 percentage point benefit related to in-transit, as we lapped last year's supply chain challenges, 9 percentage points of growth related to pack and hold, and close to two-thirds of the remaining increase is attributable to elevated levels of slow-turning basics and the remainder seasonal products. Compared to pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of 2019, ending inventory was up 12%. While an improvement in trend versus the first half as we expected, we are entering the fourth quarter with overall elevated inventory levels and some carryover of fall product, despite the increased markdown activity in the third quarter.Although, we did take action earlier this year to reduce holiday receipts, we continue to anticipate a competitive promotional environment, given the increased inventory levels industry-wide and plan to continue to take aggressive action to clear inventory in order to enter fiscal 2023 better positioned. As we look to fiscal 2023, we continue to moderate buys and expect to begin to lean into our responsive levers this spring, which will provide further flexibility to better align inventory levels with demand trends next year. In addition, we are releasing some of last year's holiday pack and hold inventory, and we'll continue to integrate our pack and hold inventory into future assortments. As you know, while pack and hold is the use of cash in the short term, we are able to optimize our margin in the near term and benefit working capital next year, as we buy lower receipts and sell through the pack and hold inventory.Quarter-end cash and equivalents were $679 million. Net cash from operating activities was an inflow of $95 million in the quarter, driven by a moderation in working capital usage as a result of our progress on improving inventory levels and composition coupled with our receipt cuts and leaner buys. As we stated last quarter, we anticipated beginning to see more normalized cash flow in the back half of the year and we are seeing that play out. We continue to focus on fortifying our balance sheet and cash position. As discussed last quarter, we've cut or deferred some capital spending and reduced the number of Old Navy stores slated for back half of the year and continue to expect CapEx of approximately $650 million for the year. We remain committed to delivering an attractive quarterly dividend as a core component of total shareholder returns.During the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.15 per share, and on November 8th, our Board approved a $0.15 dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We repurchased 1.2 million shares early in the quarter. As discussed last quarter, we have completed our goal of offsetting dilution in fiscal 2022 and do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares this year. We continue to have $476 million available under our current share repurchase program authorization. Before closing, we understand that there has been increased focus on freight and commodity-related tailwinds in fiscal 2023 across the industry as we've all begun to see favorability in rates. As a reminder, we have experienced a more modest freight headwind throughout fiscal 2022 as compared to many other retailers as a result of our long-term ocean contracts, which were locked in at favorable rates.These negotiated rates remain below current ocean container rates. As a result, as ocean container rates come down, this will not represent a significant tailwind to our margin as it may for other retailers as we look to fiscal 2023. In addition, as it relates to cotton and commodity costs, we have already made purchases through the first half of fiscal 2023, and therefore will not begin to benefit from advantaged pricing until we enter the back half of next year. In closing, while we continue to navigate an uncertain consumer environment and promotionally competitive environment, we are confident in the actions we're taking and believe we are taking the right steps to position Gap Inc. back on its path towards sustainable, profitable growth and delivering value to our shareholders over the long-term.With that, we'll open the line for questions.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Is Cisco Systems Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$14.6bUS$16.0bUS$15.7bUS$16.3bUS$16.9bUS$17.3bUS$17.6bUS$18.0bUS$18.3bUS$18.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.02%Est @ 2.01%Est @ 2.00%Est @ 1.99%Est @ 1.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$13.6kUS$13.8kUS$12.6kUS$12.1kUS$11.7kUS$11.1kUS$10.5kUS$10.0kUS$9.4kUS$8.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$114bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$19b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$336bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$336b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$161bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$274b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$47.5, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.020. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Cisco SystemsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Communications industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Reported EPS is $0.86, expectations were $0.84.Operator: Welcome to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.Marilyn Mora: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter fiscal year 2023 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be done on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.Story continuesWith respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.cisco, valley, silicon, logo, network, switch, tech, provider, business, sign, symbol, infrastructure, hub, technology, computer, equipment, computing, bone, electronic,Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comChuck Robbins: Thank you, Marilyn, and thank you all for joining us today. We are off to a good start in fiscal 2023, delivering strong results, exceeding the top end of our guidance range for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS. We delivered the largest quarterly revenue in our history, driven by excellent execution and the actions our team took to remediate our supply challenges. Given these results, along with the strength of our orders, our visibility and easing supply constraints, we are raising our full year outlook, which Scott will cover later. While we are proactively managing through an evolving and complex market environment, we remain intensely focused on executing on our strategy, including our transition to more software and subscription based recurring revenue.We achieved software revenue growth of 5% year-over-year and software subscription revenue grew 11%. The easing of supply constraints and our ability to deliver hardware is now releasing software subscriptions that were sitting in backlog connecting to unshipped hardware. Our success is also reflected in our ARR, which exceeded $23 billion, increasing 7% with product ARR growing 12%. We also ended the quarter with RPO of nearly $31 billion, up 3% year-over-year with product RPO, up 5%. Over $16 billion of the RPO will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months with a backlog that remains elevated at near-record levels. These metrics give us increased visibility and predictability and provide additional confidence in our ability to perform through the current market cycle.It also underscores our unique position, helping customers become more agile and resilient as they continue to navigate a complex set of challenges. As I've done in the past, I'd like to provide an update on supply chain before discussing our Q1 results. Like you've heard from others in the industry, we are encouraged by what we are seeing with modest improvement in certain component availability as shortages continue to ease from last quarter. The redesign of many of our products has also helped bring supply stability and more resiliency. Over the last few quarters, you've heard me talk about the actions we've taken to navigate supply constraints. These actions are paying off and are contributing to our results. We now have greater visibility in the ramp of our customer product deliveries, which in turn gives us greater confidence in our fiscal 2023 outlook.Now, moving to performance highlights in the quarter. We delivered revenues of $13.6 billion, up 6%, and non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.86, our second highest quarterly non-GAAP EPS in the history of the company. We also generated $4 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $2 billion to our shareholders. These metrics show we remain committed to operating discipline, and our balanced capital allocation priorities. We are continuing to invest in our long-term growth opportunities, while also returning capital to shareholders. In terms of our product orders in the quarter, it's important to note that, the year-over-year comparison is against an unusually strong period of 34% growth in Q1 of fiscal year 2022. From a geographic perspective, we saw some emerging cautiousness in Europe.See also  Countries By GDP: 30 Biggest Economies in the World and 12 Biggest Industries in the US.This is driven by a dramatic increase in energy costs and market volatility, which is leading customers to assess their overall spend. However, this also presents an opportunity for us as our technologies like IoT, Silicon One and Power over Ethernet drive a significant reduction in power consumption. To provide a normalized perspective, our Q4 to Q1 sequential growth was just slightly below the normal range over the last six years. It's also important to note that, this was the second highest Q1 orders in the history of the company. We have strong product revenue momentum in key parts of our business, including secure agile networks, security and optimized application experiences. We also saw record performance from a number of products, including the Catalyst 9000 family, Cisco 8000, Wireless, Meraki, ThousandEyes and Duo.Networking is becoming increasingly critical to every organization, led by digital transformation, hybrid cloud, AI and ML workloads. This is driving demand for our technologies. As we've discussed, there are also tailwinds for our business such as hybrid work, 400 gig and beyond, 5G, WiFi 6 security and full stack observability. We believe these broader technology transitions will require every customer to re-architect their network infrastructure, and in turn, fuel long-term growth across our portfolio. As I speak with customers, they tell me that, while they are closely watching the economy, they remain focused on making the right investments across their business to increase their agility and drive greater innovation and productivity. In our web scale business, demand remains solid, driven by their growing investments with Cisco to build out AI fabric and massively scalable cloud networks.Once again, we saw strong momentum with our Silicon One-based Cisco 8000 routers. We are experiencing robust demand for our 400-gig products and now have nearly 1,200 customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, web-scale orders were up double digits or greater for the eighth consecutive quarter. Network capacity demand continues to increase, driven by 5G, IoT, pervasive video and other technology trends I've mentioned earlier. With our commitment to powering next-generation networks, while also driving sustainability, we launched new 800 gig switching platforms built on our Silicon One G100 chip to help meet customers demand for more programmability, bandwidth and energy efficiency. Let me now touch on our innovation as I'm incredibly proud of how our teams have come together to deliver market-leading solutions for our customers.Security and hybrid work are now more critical than ever. We continue to extend our capabilities to enable customers to work more securely anywhere, while reducing cost and complexity. In security, we introduced new data loss prevention, firewall and Zero Trust capabilities across our portfolio. And in collaboration, we announced more than 40 new innovations to power hybrid work and deliver exceptional customer experiences. We're also committed to giving our customers more choice. An example of this is our partnership with Microsoft to bring Microsoft teams to Cisco meeting room devices. By doing this, we are driving interoperability and demonstrating our openness to meet our customers' need and provide greater flexibility. To wrap up, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth.The strength of orders, increased visibility and easing supply situation provides us with enhanced visibility and predictability, which underpins the confidence we have in our business and our increased outlook for the year. Our performance this quarter is a testament to our innovation and execution to support our customers during these complex times. Additionally, it reinforces Cisco's strength, durability and discipline in how we manage the business while investing to capture the multiyear growth opportunities ahead. Our portfolio is in great shape and our business model is resilient with 43% of our revenue now recurring, which is very important as we navigate the current macro environment. The hard work and dedicated commitment of our leadership team and employees over the last few years to transform our business model is reflected in the performance we delivered this quarter.Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and our position in the market, we have an excellent foundation for delivering long-term results. I will now turn it over to Scott.Scott Herren: Thanks, Chuck. We started the fiscal year with a strong Q1, reflecting solid execution and disciplined management. We had record total revenue of $13.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, driven by product shipment levels above our expectations, and continued improvements in component supply. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.8%, down 150 basis points in line with our guidance range, primarily driven by higher component costs as well as logistics costs related to supply constraints. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 2% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.86, up 5%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $10.2 billion, up 8% and service revenue was flat at $3.4 billion.Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks performed well, up 12%. And Switching revenue grew with double-digit growth in campus switching, driven by growth in our Catalyst 9000 and Meraki offerings. Our data center switching modestly declined, we saw solid growth in our Nexus 9000 offering. Enterprise routing declined primarily from the product transition to our Catalyst 8000 series routers along with constrained supply. Wireless had very strong double-digit growth driven, primarily by our WiFi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the future was down 5%, driven by declines in cable, optical and edge. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000 offering and strong double-digit growth in web scale. Collaboration was down 2%, driven by a decline in meetings, partially offset by growth in calling.End-to-end security was up 9%, driven by unified threat management and Zero Trust offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio continues to perform well, driven by strong performance in our Duo offering. Optimized application experiences, was up 7%, driven by double-digit growth in our SaaS-based offering, ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more software and subscriptions. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $23.2 billion, which increased 7% with product ARR growth of 12%. Total software revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of 5%, with software subscription revenue up 11%. 85% of the software revenue was subscription based, which is up 5 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to have over $2 billion of software orders in our product backlog.Total subscription revenue was $5.9 billion, an increase of 6%. Total subscription revenue represented 43% of Cisco's total revenue. And RPO was $30.9 billion, up 3%. Product RPO increased 5% and service RPO increased 1%. Total short-term RPO grew to $16.4 billion. In terms of orders in Q1, we had the second highest Q1 orders in our history. Although product orders were down 14% for the quarter, it's important to keep in mind that, that compare against 34% growth from a year ago. We continue to have low cancellation rates, which remain below pre-pandemic levels. Looking at our geographic segments year-on-year. The Americas was down 10%, EMEA was down 23% and APJC down 10%. In our customer markets, Service Provider was down 23%, Commercial was down 14%, Enterprise was down 13% and Public Sector was down 7%.Total non-GAAP gross margin came in within our guidance range at 63%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 61%, down 280 basis points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, up 230 basis points. In our product gross margin, the decrease was primarily driven by both component costs, as well as higher freight and logistics costs related to supply constraints. This was partially offset by strong positive pricing impact as a result of the actions we took in the prior year, as well as some benefit from product mix. Backlog levels for both our hardware and software continue to far exceed historical levels. As we navigated a complex supply environment, we were able to increase our shipments this quarter, resulting in about a 10% decrease in total backlog sequentially, which remains at the second highest level we've seen.Just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $30.9 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our top line. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.8 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $4 billion, up 16% year-over-year. In capital allocation, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and approximately $500 million of share repurchases. All of this is in line with our long-term objective of returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders. We also ended the quarter with $14.7 billion in stock repurchase authorization.To summarize, we executed well in Q1 in a highly complex environment, delivering better than expected top line growth and non-GAAP profitability. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Consistent with that objective, we announced some restructuring actions focused on prioritizing our investments across our highest growth opportunities and rightsizing our real estate footprint to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to our financial guidance for Q2. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5%. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 63% to 64%.Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. And non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. For fiscal year 2023, our guidance is we are raising our expectations for revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. This is up from the prior range of 4% to 6% growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.51 to $3.58, also up 4.5% to 6.5% year-on-year. In both our Q2 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Our Q2 guidance reflects the increased visibility we have from our significant backlog and the RPO we have built up with our business model transformation, as well as the easing of supply constraints.The full year guidance rolls forward our Q1 overperformance with a prudent view of the remainder of the year. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&amp;A.Marilyn Mora: Thanks, Scott.
