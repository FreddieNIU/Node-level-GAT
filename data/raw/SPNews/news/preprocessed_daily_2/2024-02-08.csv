While that’s a strong return, it pales in comparison to the double and triple share price returns seen in other chip stocks over the same time period.', 'Demand for Applied Materials’s products has never been stronger and that has helped the company’s earnings.

However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more."", 'While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.', ' View our latest analysis for Nucor ', ""Notably, that recent sale by President Leon Topalian was not the only time they sold Nucor shares this year. Earlier in the year, they fetched US$168 per share in a -US$3.3m sale. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$186). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Nucor insiders own 0.6% of the company, currently worth about US$255m based on the recent share price.

12,6aa015e6-f34f-318e-85bd-701b181113a4,CF,2024-02-08,15 Biggest Agriculture Stocks in 2024,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-agriculture-stocks-2024-203701833.html,1707338221,STORY,"['CTVA', 'DE', 'ADM', 'MOS', 'BG']","['In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest agriculture stocks in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of the agriculture industry and what can be classified as an agriculture stock, then you can take a look at the 5 Biggest Agriculture Stocks in 2024. ', ""Despite having been replaced by industrialization, services, and now information technology, agriculture is nevertheless indispensable when it comes to maintaining and growing modern day societies. At the same time, since it's the one industry that has accompanied modern day civilization since its start, agriculture has also evolved with the ages. Now, companies that we can characterize as agriculture stocks no longer need to be involved either directly in the process of farming, in the process of storing food, or even in providing products such as pesticides and fertilizers to make a farmer's life easier."", 'Instead, agriculture stocks such as the industrial behemoth Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) are manufacturing firms that make complex equipment capable of carrying out the tasks of hundreds of workers at a lower cost. Machines such as the ones made by Deere have transformed the way human beings have been able to grow, matching the impact by pureplay agriculture stocks such as Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. (NASDAQ:PACB) and Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA).', ""In fact, technologies that agriculture stocks such as Pacific Biosciences rely on would be classified as nothing short of science fiction at the very least or even magic by farmers of previous centuries. PacBio sells systems that enable scientists and researchers to sequence the code of biological organisms. So, while farmers of 1900 would have to contend with seeing their crops die in the face of disease, today's farmers can rely on crops that have been genetically engineered to be resistant to the same attackers. Similarly, ranchers or cattle farmers can rely on livestock capable of meeting modern day production needs of both milk and meat."", 'All these factors combined mean that agriculture stocks are quite lucrative. While they might not be as glitzy as high end artificial intelligence firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), agriculture stocks provide investors with the comfort of knowing that the demand for their products will continue as long as humans rely on biological food for sustenance. This makes the stocks attractive during periods of economic downturn, like their counterparts in the consumer defensive stock sector.', 'At the same time, agriculture stocks are nevertheless vulnerable to the same market weaknesses as other stocks. Like broader commodity prices, agriculture stocks also rely on global supply chain stability to act as the backbone of their valuation. For instance, companies like Corteva that sell seeds might have a large portion of their customers located in an international country. If the shipping lines to that country are threatened, or if domestic conditions make spending money difficult for locals, then Corteva might see its investors become worried - causing the share price to drop.', ""Broadly speaking, we can break down agriculture stocks into several categories depending on the supply chain. At the backend of the chain, or upstream as analysts would like to call it, are seed, fertilizer, and medicine companies such as Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), Corteva, and the well known Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (OTC:BAYRY). Then, after the farmers have grown the crops, firms such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) pop in and buy their products to act as a middle party between the farmer and the market. Agriculture stocks such as Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) procure products such as potatoes and sell them in the form of finished products such as fries further down the supply chain. From here on, agriculture stocks see the end of the road as retailers like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) deliver the product in the consumer's hands."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest agriculture stocks as we head into 2024. Some of the biggest agriculture stocks are Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE)."", 'A close-up shot of a cannabis leaf on a cannabis cultivation farm.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the biggest agriculture stocks, we ranked the U.S. listed top 21 holdings of the iShares MSCI Agriculture Producers ETF by their latest market capitalization and picked out the biggest stocks.', 'For this list of the biggest agriculture stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -64.1%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $1.49 billion, down 43% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.55% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CF?', ""For CF, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.49%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CF will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CF would post earnings of $0.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of -9.57%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""CF doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Bernard?"", ""Bernard Zovighian: Thank you, Mark, and welcome, everyone. At our recent Investor Conference, I introduced our exciting vision of a new era of structural heart innovation to address significant unmet patient needs. Today, I will build on that theme and share key highlights of our team's strong performance in 2023 as well as our confidence in 2024. We are pleased with our strong 2023 financial performance, with full year sales up 12% to $6 billion, including strong growth across each of our four product groups. We invested more than $1 billion in research and development, and we achieved key strategic milestones, including the introduction of new technologies and indication expansion to ensure sustainable healthy growth in the near, mid, and long term."", 'We exited the year with strong momentum, with Q4 growth of 13% and TAVR growth of 12%. These results were better than expected, driven by our broad portfolio of innovative therapies. In 2024, we are well-positioned to enter a new era of structural heart innovation. In TAVR, we are strengthening our leadership. We are experiencing strong adoption of our flagship SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA and continuing enrollment in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for next-gen TAVR technology SAPIEN X4. In January, we achieved very important milestones with the completion of enrollment in PROGRESS, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of moderate aortic stenosis patients, a population estimated to be twice as large as severe aortic stenosis. This randomized trial enrolled approximately 750 patients two years ahead of schedule.', 'At TCT, later this year, we plan to present data from EARLY TAVR, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of patient with severe aortic stenosis, but without symptoms. We believe that all of these initiatives position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future. In TMTT, we achieved significant milestones with continued PASCAL global expansion and the introduction of EVOQUE in Europe. In Germany, EVOQUE was recently granted NUB Reimbursement Status 1, a very important step in therapy adoption. I am also pleased to announce that EVOQUE recently became the first transcatheter therapy to receive US FDA approval for the treatment of TR patients. This is an exciting development for a wide range of US patients. It will enable access to a groundbreaking treatment option that not only has the potential to significantly improve their quality of life, but also shows favorable clinical trends in all-cause mortality, reintervention, and heart failure hospitalization.', 'With the ongoing introduction of EVOQUE, we are now offering a unique and broad portfolio of transcatheter repair and replacement solution for mitral and tricuspid patients. In addition, the completion of enrollment in the pivotal trial studying SAPIEN M3 puts us on track to further enhance our portfolio. I am confident that we are reaching an inflection point as the only company with a commercially approved portfolio of catheter-based technologies to treat the millions of patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid disease. In addition to the meaningful progress of TAVR and TMTT, we are pleased with the company innovative RESILIA tissue, which was pioneered by our surgical business. We are on track to treat half a million patients with RESILIA-based heart valve by the end of 2024, supported by seven years of clinical evidence.', ""The previously announced spin-off of Critical Care is progressing as planned and will enable a sharpened focus on structural heart. As a result, Edwards' 2025 organic sales growth rate will be even more distinguished. In addition, this will give us more agility, increase our pace of innovation, and provide an expanded opportunity to serve a large and growing patient population. Because we are solely focused on structural heart disease, we are uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and extend our leadership. Now, I will provide some additional details by product group. In TAVR, our full year 2023 global sales of $3.9 billion increased 10.6% year-over-year. Our US and OUS sales growth rates were similar. In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales of $979 million increased 12% year-over-year."", ""Performance was driven by double-digit growth in the US, Europe, and Japan. The company competitive position was stable globally, and local selling price were also stable. In the US, we remain pleased with the continued expansion and adoption of a SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA platform. This technology builds on Edwards' longstanding leadership in tissue technology and durability by combining advancements in tissue science with the industry-leading SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA -- Ultra valve. Developing safe, effective, and durable heart valve requires significant long-term commitment, and we are proud to build on 65 years on valve innovation while leveraging the expertise and know-how of more than 2,000 engineers and R&D specialists across the company."", ""We are proud of uninterrupted leadership in structural heart and will continue to invest vigorously in these platforms. In addition, our scaling of patient activation initiative along with next-gen TAVR and additional evidence on asymptomatic and moderate AS patients, position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future. Outside of the US, in the fourth quarter, our double-digit growth was comparable with our global TAVR growth, driven by Europe and Japan. Long term, we continue to anticipate excellent opportunities for growth, as international adoption of TAVR therapy remain quite low in many regions. In Europe, Edwards' sales growth was driven by the broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. It is encouraging that the growth in Q4 was widespread across all major countries."", 'Looking ahead, we are pleased with the recently announced CE Mark approval for SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, and we are planning for a disciplined launch. We were pleased with our sales growth in Japan, and as expected, we grew faster than overall procedural growth. After more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experience and over 1 million patients treated with SAPIEN valve around the world, our TAVR platform is positioned for continued global leadership and strong sustainable growth. Given the under-treatment rates, we are confident in the future of TAVR, driven by greater awareness, patient activation, a platform that delivers lifetime management for AS patients, advances in new technologies. such as RESILIA, as well as indication expansion and increased global adoption.', 'Turning to TMTT now. In 2023, we remained focused on our key value drivers to unlock the significant long-term opportunity for patients, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption, and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. Based on the deep learnings we have achieved from our clinical trial and real-world experiences, we have carefully constructed a strategic portfolio of leading transcatheter technologies to provide both repair and replacement solutions for mitral and tricuspid patients. PASCAL Precision, EVOQUE, and SAPIEN M3 will provide best-in-class therapies to treat the broadest range of patients. Full year global sales of $198 million increased 67% versus the prior year.', ""TMTT's fourth quarter sales of $56 million increased 71% versus the prior year. Q4 sales were driven by the accelerating adoption of our differentiated PASCAL Precision platform and activation of more centers across the US and Europe. We were encouraged by the ongoing double-digit growth of overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure, which highlights the large unmet patient need. We continue to expand global access of PASCAL Precision in new countries, including Japan, where we recently completed our first cases. Since launch, we have proudly treated more than 20,000 patients around the globe with PASCAL repair system. In mitral replacement, we have received FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 continued access program. Physicians are continuing to treat patients with this novel therapy."", 'In tricuspid replacement, we initiated the launch of EVOQUE in Europe, with a focus on outstanding outcomes and the goal of eliminating tricuspid regulation in patients. And in the US, following the recent early FDA approval, we are initiating the introduction of its novel therapy and building the foundation for long-term expansion. As we did for TAVR, we are focusing on best-in-class physician training, generating more evidence, and achieving excellent patient outcomes. We are grateful for the strong ongoing collaboration with clinicians all over the world to provide the treatment options to many patients suffering from tricuspid valve disease. In tricuspid repair, the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues to enroll well and remains on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year.', ""As a summary for TMTT, we are reaching an inflection point with the only portfolio of approved catheter-based mitral and tricuspid technologies. We remain committed to bringing our differentiated therapy to patients with this live threatening disease and believe our strategy positions us well for leadership. In our surgical product group, full year global sales of $999 million increased 13% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter global sales of $248 million increased 10%. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards' premium RESILIA technology and overall procedural volumes. We are confident about the future of its tissue technology and its role in improving patient lifetime management. We continue to see positive momentum in our innovation globally with continued adoption for patients best treated surgically, including those with complex and concomitant procedures."", 'We continue to expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence, including ongoing patient enrollment of our MOMENTIS clinical study, we received CE Mark approval of our MITRIS RESILIA valve in the fourth quarter and have begun to launch in several European countries with favorable physician feedback. Turning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $928 million increased 10% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $250 million increased 11%. Growth was driven by contribution from all product lines, led by HemoSphere and Smart Recovery with strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor equipped with the Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm. Critical Care strategy is to drive growth through Smart Recovery and Smart Expansion, which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions and get patients home to their family faster.', 'And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott.', ""Scott Ullem: Okay. Thanks a lot, Bernard. So today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2023, including detailed results of our fourth quarter as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024. As Bernard mentioned, we were pleased with our better-than-expected Q4 sales performance with strength across all product groups. We achieved total sales of $1.53 billion, which represents 13% year-over-year growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.64. Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 included one-time expenses associated with our planned spin-off of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS for this and other items is included with today's release. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2024 with the exception of TMTT."", ""Absent big moves in foreign exchange, we expect total company sales of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion; TAVR sales of $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion; Surgical Structural Heart sales of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion; and Critical Care sales of $900 million to $1 billion. Given the early FDA approval for EVOQUE, we now expect full year TMTT sales to be at the higher end of our previous $280 million to $320 million guidance range. For the first quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.66. And now, I'll cover the additional details from our P&L. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8% compared to 81% in the same period last year. This expected year-over-year reduction was driven by impacts from foreign exchange."", ""Last year, Edwards' gross profit margin was lifted by a significant impact from FX. We continue to expect our full year 2024 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $480 million or 31.3% of sales compared to $411 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy and patient activation initiatives. We continue to expect full year 2024 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we invest in field-based personnel and patient activation initiatives and increase our focus on efficient G&A leverage. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter grew 16% over the prior year to $270 million or 17.6% of sales."", 'This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect research and development to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth with the goal of treating even more patients. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $17 million of one-time costs associated with our previously announced spin-off of Critical Care. Additional one-time costs will be incurred throughout 2024 prior to the expected separation at year-end. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.3%, or 13.4% excluding the impact of special items.', 'For the full year 2023, our reported tax rate was 12.4% or 15.0% excluding the impact of special items. Our lower-than-expected non-GAAP rate in the fourth quarter benefited primarily from US tax credits on foreign remittances and income tax. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 80 basis points or $9 million compared to the prior year. FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 320 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on fourth quarter earnings per share. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $48 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $136 million less capital spending of $88 million.', ""Adjusted free cash flow for the full year 2023 was $943 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $896 million less capital spending of $253 million. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the $300 million payment related to the Medtronic intellectual property agreement. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted free cash flow will grow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. Before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.0 million shares through an accelerated repurchase agreement and a pre-established 10b5-1 plan."", 'As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined to 607 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2024 to be between 600 million and 610 million. We have approximately $1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And with that, back to you, Bernard.', 'Bernard Zovighian: Thank you, Scott. In conclusion, we are proud of the significant progress we made in 2023, advancing new breakthrough therapies for patients and delivering solid financial performance and healthy profitability. We are even more excited about 2024. This year, we anticipate launching groundbreaking technologies and advancing multiple important clinical trials. These breakthroughs, along with significant unmet patient needs, give us confidence in our ability to accelerate growth in 2025 and beyond.

Bernard?"", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', ""Thank you, Mark, and welcome, everyone. At our recent investor conference, I introduced our exciting vision of a new era of structural heart innovation to address significant unmet patient needs. Today, I will build on that theme and share key highlights of our team's strong performance in 2023 as well as our confidence in 2024.We are pleased with our strong 2023 financial performance with full year sales up 12% to $6 billion, including strong growth across each of our 4 product groups. We invested more than $1 billion in research and development, and we achieved key strategic milestones, including the introduction of new technologies and indication expansion to ensure sustainable healthy growth in the near, mid and long term. We exited the year with strong momentum with Q4 growth of 13% and TAVR growth of 12%. These results were better than expected, driven by our broad portfolio of innovative therapies.In 2024, we are well positioned to enter a new era of structural heart innovation. In TAVR, we are strengthening our leadership. We are experiencing strong adoption of our flagship SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA and continuing enrollment in our ALLIANCE pivotal trial for our next-gen TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4.In January, we achieved a very important milestone with the completion of enrollment in progress, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of moderate aortic stenosis patients, a population estimated to be twice as large as severe aortic stenosis. This randomized trial enrolled approximately 750 patients, 2 years ahead of schedule. At TCT later this year, we plan to present data from early TAVR, a pivotal trial studying the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis, but without symptoms. We believe that all these initiatives position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future.In TMTT, we achieved significant milestones with continued PASCAL global expansion and the introduction of EVOQUE in Europe. In Germany, EVOQUE was recently granted NUB reimbursement status 1, a very important step in therapy adoption. I am also pleased to announce that EVOQUE recently became the first transcatheter therapy to receive USFDA approval for the treatment of TR patients.This is an exciting development for a wide range of U.S. patients. It will enable access to a groundbreaking treatment option that not only has the potential to significantly improve their quality of life, but also shows favorable clinical trends in all-cause mortality, re-intervention and heart failure hospitalization.With the ongoing introduction of EVOQUE, we are now offering a unique and broad portfolio of transcatheter repair and replacement solution for mitral and tricuspid patients. In addition, the completion of enrollment in the pivotal trial studying SAPIEN M3 put us on track to further enhance our portfolio. I am confident that we are reaching an inflection point as the only company with a commercially approved portfolio of catheter-based technologies to treat the millions of patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid disease.In addition to the meaningful progress of TAVR and TMTT, we are pleased with the company innovative RESILIA issue, which was pioneered by our surgical business. We are on track to treat 0.5 million patients with RESILIA-based hard valve by the end of 2024, supported by 7 years of clinical evidence. The previously announced spinoff of Critical Care is progressing as planned and will enable our sharpened focus on structural heart. As a result, Edwards' 2025 organic sales growth rate will be even more distinguished.In addition, this will give us more agility, increase our pace of innovation and provide an expanded opportunity to serve a large and growing patient population. Because we are solely focused on structural heart disease, we are uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and external leadership.Now I will provide some additional detail by product group. In TAVR, our full year 2023 global sales of $3.9 billion increased 10.6% year-over-year. Our U.S. and OUS sales growth rates were similar. In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR sales of 979 million increased 12% year-over-year. Performance was driven by double-digit growth in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The company's competitive position was stable globally and local selling price were also stable. In the U.S., we remain pleased with the continued expansion and adoption of a SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA platform. This technology builds on Edwards' long-standing leadership in tissue technology and durability by combining advancements in tissue science with the industry-leading SAPIEN 3 Ultra valve.Developing safe, effective and durable heart valve requires significant long-term commitment, and we are proud to be on 65 years on valve innovation while leveraging the expertise and know-how of more than 2,000 engineers and R&D specialists across the company. We are proud of uninterrupted leadership in structural heart and will continue to invest vigorously in these platforms. In addition, our scaling of patient activation initiatives, along with next-gen TAVR and additional evidence on asymptomatic and moderate AS patients position us for healthy, sustainable TAVR growth well into the future.Outside of the U.S., in the fourth quarter, our double-digit growth was comparable with our global TAVR growth, driven by Europe and Japan. Long term, we continue to anticipate excellent opportunities for growth. The international adoption of TAVR therapy remained quite low in many regions. In Europe, Edwards sales growth was driven by the broad-based adoption of our SAPIEN platform. It is encouraging that the growth in Q4 was widespread across all major countries.Looking ahead, we are pleased with the recently announced CE Mark approval for SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, and we are planning for a disciplined launch. We were pleased with our sales growth in Japan, and as expected, we grew faster than overall procedural growth. After more than 20 years of rigorous clinical experience and over 1 million patients treated with SAPIEN around the world, our TAVR platform is positioned for continued global leadership and strong sustainable growth.Given the undertreatment rates, we are confident in the future of TAVR, driven by greater awareness, patient activation, a platform that delivers lifetime management for AS patients, advances in new technologies such as RESILIA as well as indication expansion and increased global adoption.Turning to TMTT now. In 2023, we remained focused on our key value drivers to unlock the significant long-term opportunity for patients, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive clinical trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. Based on the deep learnings we have achieved from our clinical trial and real-world experiences, we have carefully constructed a strategic portfolio of leading transcatheter technologies to provide both repair and replacement solutions for mitral intricacy patients.PASCAL PRECISION, EVOQUE and SAPIEN M3 will provide best-in-class therapies to treat a broader range of patients. Full year global sales of $198 million increased 67% versus the prior year. TMTT fourth quarter sales of $56 million increased 71% versus the prior year. Q4 sales were driven by the accelerating adoption of our differentiated PASCAL PRECISION platform and activation of more centers across the U.S. and Europe. We were encouraged by the ongoing double-digit growth of overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure, which highlights the large unmet patient need.We continue to expand global access of PASCAL PRECISION in new countries, including Japan, where we recently completed our first case. Since launch, we have proudly treated more than 20,000 patients around the globe with Pascal repair system. In mitral replacement, we have received FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 continued access program. Physicians are continuing to patients with this novel therapy.In tricuspid replacement, we initiated the launch of EVOQUE in Europe, with a focus on outstanding outcomes and the goal of eliminating tricuspid regurgitation in patients. And in the U.S. Following the recent early FDA approval, we are initiating the introduction of this novel therapy and building the foundation for long-term expansion.As we did for TAVR, we are focusing on best-in-class physician training, generating more evidence and achieving excellent patient outcomes. We are grateful for the strong ongoing collaboration with clinicians all over the world to provide the treatment options to many patients suffering from tricuspid valve disease. In tricuspid repair, the Class II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues to enroll well, and remains on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year.As a summary for TMTT, we are reaching an inflection point with the only portfolio of approved catheter-based mitral and tricuspid technologies. We remain committed to bringing our differentiated therapy to patients with this live frightening disease and believe our strategy positions us well for leadership. In our surgical product group, full year global sales of $999 million increased 13% versus the prior year.Fourth quarter global sales of $248 million increased 10%. Growth was driven by strong global adoption of Edwards' premium RESILIA technology and overall procedural volumes. We are confident about the future of its tissue technology and its role in improving patient lifetime management. We continue to see positive momentum in our innovation globally with continued adoption for patients best treated surgically, including those with complex and concomitant procedures.We continue to expand the overall body of RESILIA evidence, including ongoing patient enrollment of our momentous clinical study. We received CE Mark approval of our MITRIS RESILIA valve in the fourth quarter and have begun to range in several European countries with favorable physician feedback.Turning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $928 million increased 10% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $250 million increased 11%. Growth was driven by contribution from all product lines, led by HemoSphere, a smart recovery with strong adoption of our Acumen IQ sensor equipped with the Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm. Critical care strategy is to drive growth through smart recovery and smart expansion, which are designed to help clinicians make more informed decisions and get patients home to their family faster.And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott."", 'Scott B. Ullem', ""Okay. Thanks a lot, Bernard. So today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2023, including detailed results of our fourth quarter as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024. As Bernard mentioned, we were pleased with our better-than-expected Q4 sales performance with strength across all product groups. We achieved total sales of $1.53 billion which represents 13% year-over-year growth. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.64.Our GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 included onetime expenses associated with our planned spin-off of Critical Care. A full reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted EPS for this and other items is included with today's release. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2024 with the exception of TMTT. Absent big moves in foreign exchange, we expect total company sales of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion. TAVR sales of $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion, Surgical Structural Heart sales of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion and Critical Care sales of $900 million to $1 billion.Given the early FDA approval for EVOQUE, we now expect full year TMTT sales to be at the higher end of our previous $280 million to $320 million guidance range. For the first quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.66. And now I'll cover the additional details from our P&L.For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.8% compared to 81% in the same period last year. This expected year-over-year reduction was driven by impacts from foreign exchange. Last year, Edwards' gross profit margin was lifted by a significant impact from FX. We continue to expect our full year 2024 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%, driven by high-value technologies that yield strong gross profit margins.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $480 million or 31.3% of sales compared to $411 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of our growth strategy and patient activation initiatives. We continue to expect full year 2024 SG&A as a percent of sales to be 29% to 30% as we invest in field-based personnel and patient activation initiatives and increase our focus on efficient G&A leverage. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter grew 16% over the prior year to $270 million or 17.6% of sales.This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter valve innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect research and development to be 17% to 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth with the goal of treating even more patients.During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $17 million of onetime costs associated with our previously announced spin-off of Critical Care. Additional onetime costs will be incurred throughout 2024 prior to the expected separation at year-end.Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 12.3% or 13.4% excluding the impact of special items. For the full year 2023, our reported tax rate was 12.4% or 15.0% excluding the impact of special items. Our lower-than-expected non-GAAP rate in the fourth quarter benefited primarily from U.S. tax credits on foreign remittances and income tax. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 14% and 17%.Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 80 basis points or $9 million compared to the prior year. FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 320 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our October guidance, FX rates had a nominal impact on fourth quarter earnings per share.Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $48 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $136 million less capital spending of $88 million. Adjusted free cash flow for the full year 2023 was $943 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $896 million less capital spending of $253 million. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the $300 million payment related to the Medtronic intellectual property agreement. We continue to expect full year 2024 adjusted free cash flow will grow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion.Before turning the call back over to Bernard, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023.During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.0 million shares through an accelerated repurchase agreement and a pre-established 10b5-1 plan. As a result, average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter declined to 607 million. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2024 to be between 600 million and 610 million. We have approximately $1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.And with that, back to you, Bernard."", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', 'Thank you, Scott. In conclusion, we are proud of the significant progress we made in 2023, advancing new breakthrough therapies for patients and delivering solid financial performance and healthy profitability. We are even more excited about 2024. This year, we anticipate launching groundbreaking technologies and advancing multiple important clinical trials. These breakthroughs along with significant unmet patient needs, give us confidence in our ability to accelerate growth in 2025 and beyond. In TAVR, we will continue to drive global adoption of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA, present pivotal trial data from early TAVR, studying asymptomatic AS patients and enrolling ALLIANCE a pivotal trial studying the next-generation SAPIEN X4.We also look forward to a number of key developments in TMTT, including the U.S. and European introduction of EVOQUE, the expanded global adoption of PASCAL PRECISION Class 2 Tier enrollment completion and SAPIEN M3 approval in Europe by the end of 2025.

Zovighian', ""Thank you, Larry. I hope you are doing well. Let me start and then I will ask Daveen to add some color here. So first, the way we are thinking about this one is like we did in TAVR. We are -- we want to make sure that we are going to introduce this very novel therapy, having in mind building foundation for long-term expansion.So we're going to be focusing on physician training, generating more evidence, excellent patient outcome, making sure we have coverage, payment, reimbursement established in the U.S. and in Europe. So we are having here a long-term view. The same way we did it in TAVR in last 20 years. But again, Daveen, I'm sure you want to share some of your plan."", 'Daveen Chopra', ""No, definitely. Thanks, Bernard. I'll start by saying, of course, we are very excited by this approval coming through the FDA breakthrough pathway. This innovation is obviously the first transcatheter technology in the U.S. to change the life of the many patients suffering from tricuspid regurgitation. As we look at kind of our rollout model, as Bernard said, we are really planning a controlled rollout this technology, focused on great clinical outcomes. And we're really going to start with those centers, that -- who are in a clinical trial and then over time, will grow in used centers.We're going to have a dedicated team of clinical case support who has been in training on the over 1,000 of vote cases that now have been done to date. And this team will continue to scale as we move forward.Specifically, on your question on -- I think I heard a question about NCD in there and the kind of timing. Obviously, with EVOQUE, it's a parallel review technology. So CMS is working on the national coverage kind of on their own process, and we are continuing to work with them to kind of provide information to help support their process. So as we all hear more about that, we'll -- you guys will definitely in the loop on that."", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', 'So what you can see, Larry, here. We have a long-term view on this one. We want to shape as we shape the space in a way that we like, in a way that everybody is going to be very proud of, like we did for TAVR.', 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', ""That's helpful. And Daveen, just one follow-up for you. What are your thoughts on the likelihood of seeing a statistically significant mortality benefit at 1 year or 18 months when the full TRISCEND II data is presented at TCT. And how important is that for adoption and reimbursement."", 'Daveen Chopra', ""Well, I think right now, as we've talked about, we've obviously shown very favorable trends in all course mortality, heart failure hospitalizations and tricuspid regurgitation. And those were some of the key trends that help us lead to our approval. Obviously, our full data set will come out of TCT in the fall with 1 year follow-up, and it's hard to speculate on what that data will show."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.', 'Robert Justin Marcus', ""Great. Congrats on a very nice data. Maybe just to follow up on that. We've seen just TMTT in general, whether it's mitral tricuspid maybe ramp over the past few years a little slower than expected. Obviously, COVID really disrupted that upward trajectory. Maybe just speak to some of the bottlenecks that you see in the system especially with tricuspid replacement, it's a totally new therapy. There will be some education, I imagine. But maybe just speak to what you see as the bottlenecks and what Edwards can do to help ramp adoption in a pretty sick patient population."", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', 'Thank you, Robbie. So let me start on your earlier comment about a little slower than expected in the past years. And then Daveen can talk about a bottleneck in the system. So if you think about it, since the beginning, since 6 years ago, when we put together this vision, we did study this patient population, mitral and tricuspid. And we knew that they were very complex diverse. And we knew from the beginning that one device, one therapy, a repair technology only will not be sufficient. Repair technology, and we are very pleased about PASCAL but can only treat some small proportion of patients. So it is why we have this vision of having a portfolio.So right now, what we have is this portfolio on the tricuspid side, we are on track to get also a mitral replacement. And what we are -- what we are going to see, what we are going to see altogether is an acceleration. Clinician will be able to treat more patients. So the dynamic in the next 10 years is going to be very different than the dynamic in the last 10 years. But again, Daveen.', 'Daveen Chopra', ""Yes, I'll make a couple of quick comments. First, we're really excited because we see that the replacement technology really has the potential to treat a large number of patients. Because especially in tricuspid regurgitation note one patient is alike. There's really a huge heterogeneity in replacement, we really see as the core of treating the largest number of patients, and then we see other technologies like tier as well as other modalities that are still in trials potentially to add new patient groups on top of that. We've seen in Europe where tricuspid as a therapy has been approved longer that centers are starting to continue to build up and grow the tricuspid practice.As you bring in technology to market, you start seeing the awareness of the disease to grow and you see more referrals and you see more patients getting to the heart team. And some of that becomes from how we imaging people correctly and we're referring them correctly at centers. And we can see that, that's exactly what we see potentially that will happen out with the new therapy of tricuspid in the U.S. We'll be able to start building up diagnosis referral to heart teams. And also, we see that there's an opportunity, as Larry talked about in the investor conference, in the TAVR group, reading so much with patient activation. And we see that all those learnings from patient activations in the future will be able to be leveraged over to the TMTT space, both for mitral and tricuspid to continue to grow the market."", 'Robert Justin Marcus', ""Great. I appreciate that. Maybe one on the TAVR market. We have the exciting data from early TAVR coming later this year at TCT. How do you think about what that does to the TAVR market growth going forward? Do you put up double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, that's what guidance includes the next few years for the most part. How do you think about what's coming from low, intermediate and high risk and severe? And then how do you think about what asymptomatic adds? Is that just what helps keep you with double digit? Or can that help accelerate growth?"", 'Larry L. Wood', ""Yes. This is Larry. That's a great question. I think the first thing is we're just going to learn a lot from this trial. There's a lot of unknown questions out there in terms of what percentage of patients are truly asymptomatic when subjected to a stress test?I think how fast do people progress and what happens to people why they're waiting. I think the biggest thing about it is, as we've talked about, and I spent a lot of time at the investor conference, the time from a patient to get diagnosed to treated is just really long. And a lot of that is the interpretation, the guidelines and this overlay of symptoms. And it's all really stand in the gears preventing the patients from moving through. And unfortunately, given the deadliness of the disease, a lot of people never actually make it to therapy.I think with the early TAVR trial, assuming that it's successful, it will just streamline that process where we can just apply guideline criteria to aortic stenosis, and it won't require this additional evaluation of symptoms and people can just move through. But remember, only about 13% of patients right now with severe aortic stenosis actually get treated. So there's a huge undertreatment right now. We think asymptomatic just adds to that."", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', 'In addition, Robbie, what I like is our commitment to -- after 20 years of TAVR, we are still in a super committed to bring big evidence. Look at these 2 trials, progress and early TAVR. This is a potential for sure not to learn more, but also to expand indication. To change the guidelines. So as a leader in the space, for sure, we like it, we are committed. But I believe that in the next 10 years, here in TAVR, we are going to see some very exciting things happening.', 'Larry L. Wood', ""Yes, I think that's right. And I think it's sort of returned to a little bit of the earlier days in TAVR, where I think we're planning on having a steady cadence of new trials and new data and new evidence that continues to not only raise awareness about the therapy but also open up new opportunities for patients to get treated that don't currently get treated today."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America.', 'Travis Lee Steed', ""Maybe talking about EVOQUE over a multiyear period. Just curious how you think that market develops compared to the mitral market, do you think that goes faster or slower. And when you think about the data that we have so far, it seems like replacement is doing better than clipping. So I don't know if you think about the mechanism of action, why replacement would be better than clipping and kind of where you see replacement clipping in the market in tricuspid?"", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', 'Go ahead.', 'Daveen Chopra', ""Yes. So I guess I'll start off with the latter part of your question about the technology. As I kind of mentioned, we see that in replacement where you're able to really eliminate tricuspid regurgitation, we see an awesome opportunity to help patients and really improve their quality of life. And we see kind of replacement with its broad applicability really being able to treat a large chunk of those tricuspid regurgitation, the vast majority of tricuspid regurgitation patients. But there's still -- but again, based on the disease state and the heterogeneity of tricuspid regurgitation, there's still going to be many patients where replacement may not make sense for anatomical or other considerations, where whether it's a closing technology or other modality may make sense. Back to your first question about how the market develops related to mitral. I think we see continued strength in this. We think the mitral market had some early strength in kind of slowdown during COVID. We think that the bicuspid market, as referrals and awareness of the disease continues, will continue to kind of grow at a very strong rate, at rates that we think, think can kind of probably exceed kind of mitral, especially with the two modalities entering the market in a very similar time, you now have an opportunity to treat a larger proportion of patients."", 'Travis Lee Steed', ""Helpful. And a follow-up, curious on the SMART trial. If the data there is good, if you think there's an impact on the market? And then also, there was news last week, when last competitor comes to the market in 2024. Does that change your view on 2025? I'm just curious what kind of competition you had kind of baked into your long-term guidance?"", 'Larry L. Wood', ""With regard to the SMART trial, I think we'll just have to wait and see the trial, and we don't know what it's going to show. But I think the key thing is thinking about how physicians select TAVR valves for their patients. And that's really a multifactorial decision. I think you have to look at mortality rates, stroke, future interventions, all those things. And hemodynamics is certainly one consideration. But I don't think it's even the driving consideration compared to some of the other factors that are probably higher on the hierarchy for patients.In terms of the competitive space, we didn't have a lot in 2024 because the -- it was expected the approval was going to come late. We know a time to ramp a new therapy. We'll have to see what the impact on 2025 is and what the revised approval timing is. And there's no real value in me speculating on that."", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', ""Yes. And in addition, as me being in my first year as CEO, I'd like to reflect a little bit about where we are as a company. And when I think about valve, making a half valve, it is not easy. Given the nature of patient needs, this is not luck. We are committed and focused for more than 60 years and we bring experience, a very deep knowledge. What we have seen, even in the past few years, there are many platform, many companies coming in and leaving the market after a year, 2 years or 3 years.So we are leading the space with a very significant long-term commitment, more than 2,000 engineers, R&D, R&D specialists. We are proud of our uninterrupted leadership in the space. And we are going to continue investing. So for sure, we take all the competitors very seriously, but we are very confident about our leadership, about our technologies and about our evidence."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley.', 'Patrick Andrew Robert Wood', ""Amazing. I guess maybe for the first one on TAVR and Japan in general. Do you think you've been taking back some share post trialing. It sounded like you feel very good about the market, and you were taking back some share on that side. Just any color you could give there would be great."", 'Larry L. Wood', ""Sure. I think what happens when new technology comes into Japan just because of the way the certification process works and people having to move through that process, that certainly had an impact for us. I think in Q4, we grew faster than the market. And I think that really relates to some of the trialing ending and people kind of moving back to our platform. But this is sort of something that goes on, but we're very pleased with how we grew in Japan in Q4 and continue to look forward to that market growing because it's a very -- it's a much lower penetrated market than places like the U.S. and Europe. So we continue to see that as a long-term growth driver for us."", 'Patrick Andrew Robert Wood', ""That's very helpful. And then just quickly as a follow-up. I get this might be difficult to comment on, but the faster-than-expected approval of EVOQUE, what in your discussions with the FDA? And what do you think they placed a great weight on in getting it comfortable with it into market faster than expected. Do you think there was like one area of data or sense of the products because that's obviously not been the experience for everyone. So just curious to get any thoughts there."", 'Daveen Chopra', ""Yes. No, sure. This is Daveen again. I'll kind of jump in this one. Obviously, we received an approval through this FDA breakthrough pathway. And this was a really innovative pathway where the basis of approval was the breakthrough cohort of the 150 patients we presented at TCT. And -- but at the same time, as we were working with the FDAs and answering their questions, we presented and gave them other data from our larger cohort, other descriptive statistics.And as we mentioned, it's that larger cohort where the results really showed those favorable trends in all-cause mortality. Heart failure hospitalizations, tricuspid re-interventions, it was those kinds of trends that I think that we believe probably have the FDA come back to us and say, oh, yes, this kind of makes sense. We probably don't need an advisory panel that led to our approval. And so we're very excited that the full cohort of data, the full 1-year cohort on the 400 patients will be presented at TCT, so we can kind of see all the data, not just kind of the breakthrough cohort plus the initial kind of look at the other data.And that going forward, right, for us, as we launch out this therapy, we continue to have a great deal of evidence. We're going to continue to have trials and more data that help show how great this therapy really could be for patients. We're planning to build this therapy with really careful physician training, great clinical outcomes. And supporting this therapy just like we as an organization did for TAVR not that long ago. And so I'm excited really for that long-term opportunity and what this means for helping patients."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore.', 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Congratulations on a nice sprint here. Maybe on the last question on EVOQUE, Daveen, you made some comments here about the totality of data. But I'm curious on when you think about the market development, is there like a bar, like do we need to see a stat significance in mortality. Like, there's a reason this valve was called forgotten valve. So I'm curious what wakes up physicians to take the valve seriously, maybe compare in contrast on how this adoption curve could look like versus I don't know if TAVR is a good example, but I would love your comments."", 'Daveen Chopra', ""Yes. No, I'll start off a little bit first on the totality of data. Now with EVOQUE, we've implanted and tracked data in clinical trials on over 1,000 patients in various studies. And what we've consistently seen is that these patients are patients who don't have an option. There are patients who are looking for options out there and don't feel great and can't do the things that they want to do every day in their life. And that the EVOQUE technology really makes a huge difference in their life. This concept, the quality of life really does matter for patients to be able to pick up -- play with your grandkids, walk up the stairs. It really does matter.And I'm not trying to discount that these other statistics matter, right, mortality, heart failure hospitalization. Those all matter as well. But we've, I think, shown in the breakthrough cohort that we at the starting point, have this amazing quality of life improvement. And that's why our indications about improvement in health status.We've got the favorable trend in the other data points, all cohorts mortality, hot failure hospitalization, tricuspid re-intervention. And those favorable trend, we'll continue to see more data as we go in the future. But as I mentioned before, we're going to continue beyond just this study, the (inaudible). We're going to continue to gather data on patients. We're going to continue to gather large data on large numbers of patients to help show how EVOQUE can really help patients.And I think it's that kind of data, along with kind of all the other key things we talked about, careful physician training, controlled rollout, excellent outcomes that will really help create this market and really do the market development. And so it's hard for me to speculate how will this compare maybe the technologies like TAVR, same question about mitral, but I'm excited for what it can do. I think there's so much opportunity to grow this market."", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', ""Thank you, Daveen, well said. And we are very excited. Think about TAVR. 20 years later, we are still generating evidence. We are still innovating with Ultra RESILIA X4. We still believe that there is a way for TAVR to grow healthy double digit in the many years to come globally. So for TM -- so here, for TMTT work, it's probably thinking the same. It is not in the next 5 years, in the next 10 or 20 years here that we are thinking of."", 'Larry L. Wood', ""Yes. Just to pile on that, having spent so much time in the TAVR space, when we deal with regulators and with payers and stuff, there's a lot of focus on mortality and people get really almost singularly focused on it. But spending the time with the patient groups that I spend, living longer, but living poorly is not a feature to them.If you told them they had this exact same life expectancy, but their quality of life would dramatically improve. That's far more valuable to them. And I think when you can get that quality of life improvement and you can get the mortality benefit, that's where you really have the home run therapy like what we've seen with TAVR. And so that's really what we're trying to build on. But I wouldn't discount the quality of life benefits, they're really significant for patients."", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Understood. That's helpful. And maybe, Scott, one quick one for you on this Q1 EPS guide, I think at the midpoint, it's slightly below sheet. I'm curious on what's driving that? Is that a step up in OpEx? Or is there a gross margin or below the line sort of issue that's impacting Q1 EPS?"", 'Scott B. Ullem', ""Yes. It's a couple of things, but largely it relates to just the lumpiness of SG&A and R&D and in what period we record those expenses. Q1, the increase in OpEx will outpace revenue according to our current forecast. And that's the reason why we end up with the midpoint of the range of $0.64 level with the EPS from the fourth quarter. But overall, it's important to remember that for the full year, we're expecting bottom line growth to exceed top line growth you get through the different quarter-to-quarter cadence."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies.', 'Matthew Charles Taylor', 'I wanted to ask you if you thought that the delays that your competitors having in the U.S. would have any impact on international markets? Does it provide you an opportunity to gain any share? Does it change anything?', 'Larry L. Wood', ""We'll have to see what the impact is. We -- certainly, we've seen cases where U.S. data has impacted international share in international markets. I think it just depends on what the data is. But I think the reality is there's been no data released. All there has been is just simply a signal that they're delaying their approval and waiting for additional data. So I don't know how much people are going to react to that.The other thing is there's more that goes into to the purchasing decision oftentimes, especially in Europe than clinical data. And for the people that are purchasing on price because there's favorable pricing and it's a significant discount. I don't know how much that will get impacted."", 'Matthew Charles Taylor', 'Got you. And can I ask one follow-up on -- you mentioned the activation of patients a few times. I know you are doing a lot there. Are you doing anything new and different there? Or is it kind of more of the same? I just was noticing the call-outs on this call.', 'Larry L. Wood', ""I think we continue to do a lot of new things. We're running a number of programs. I think one of the things that I talked about at the investor conference is, I know there's a lot of speculation on -- and skepticism, frankly, on the undertreatment rates and are all those patients really there. I can tell you we've done enough work in major health systems where we've applied things like AI to the Echo reports, and we can absolutely definitively say the patients are there. They're just not moving through the system for a variety of reasons.So the first thing you have to do is validate, the second thing you have to do is get people to understand what to do about it, and then you have to move them through the process and get treated. And we have multiple things that we're working on to drive those patients through, but we are literally continually evolving these programs to try to optimize them to activate patients off the sidelines and move them through the system in a streamlined fashion."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays.', 'Matthew Stephan Miksic', 'So I had one on EVOQUE and one follow-up on margins, if I could. So not to put you fine a point on it, but moving from the middle of your TMTT range to the high end is like $10 million to $20 million. And -- so if we think about EVOQUE came about 5, 6 months early. Does that tell us what we need to know about your sort of expectations for the run rate this year knowing what we know now, I guess, in the brokers we just get started in the U.S.? And then I have one follow-up.', 'Daveen Chopra', ""No, Matt. Thanks so much for the question. It's Daveen again. Yes, if you first look at the timing of it, right, we kind of said midyear was kind of our initial estimation, and midyear has got a couple of months kind of window. So this definitely was up by a couple of months earlier than we kind of expected. And so based on what we know now, we continue to be confident in what we think EVOQUE can do. And obviously, we'll see as we get through adoption and we start moving through centers, training how fast the rate is, but that help us bring this up just a little bit.I think the other comment I'll make is things like new technology add-on payments, right, which are helpful for hospitals, to help ensure that they're adequately kind of profitable and doing a good job comes online October 1, and that date doesn't really change whether you get earlier approval or late approval. So there are some factors like that. But we'll continue to look at as we adapt over the course of the year and how it grows and give updates as if needed."", 'Matthew Stephan Miksic', ""That's great. And then the follow-up on the margins and Matt's question just now on the activities that you're getting after in the field. So you hired these folks in, I guess, in the fourth quarter, which is part of the step up in spending there. Just wondering, first, does that have an impact in Q4? Can you talk a little bit about the benefits that you're seeing so far from those investments in that. Second, are you continuing those investments? Or to your point earlier, Scott, about like leverage against those investments, are you kind of done and now it's about achieving leverage against sort of a set additional spend that you put into the field."", 'Scott B. Ullem', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, we're just getting started with building out our field force both for EVOQUE but as well as we continue to expand the presence of our overall TMTT portfolio. And so this is the beginning of an investment in building a foundation of a team in the field, not the end. You should expect that we're going to continue to grow our resources, invest in the field team. And by the way, that's not limited just to TMTT. TAVR continues to grow aggressively, and we're investing more resources to support that growth as well.One of the things we're doing, though, is looking carefully at general and administrative expenses globally. And as Edwards has put down a broader global footprint, it gives us an opportunity to get some leverage from scale. And so we're going to be continuing to look closely at that and making sure that we're being as efficient as we can be on the P&L."", 'Matthew Stephan Miksic', ""Okay. And then the TAVR side, did you see any results you feel from these field activations and patient activation efforts in Q4? Or is that something that's still to come?"", 'Scott B. Ullem', ""Matt, I think we saw some benefit from the patient activation initiatives that we have in place. It's tough to isolate those from the other efforts that we have underway to continue to support the growth of TAVR. But no, that's certainly helping drive growth in the fourth quarter and beyond."", 'Larry L. Wood', ""Just to add on to this, I mean, I think it'd be incorrect to say our patient activation efforts are just starting to pay dividends now. We've been doing patient activation for the last, I don't know, 5 or 6 years through our digital campaigns, through some of our website stuff, some of our patient resources, some of the general cardiology awareness events we do and a number of other things that have been driving this. So I think patient activation has been contributing all the way along the way.I think what we're talking about now, though, is a much more sophisticated approach and program to really tapping in to these untreated patients that are in the system, but hospitals don't really realize that they're there. And how do we bridge those gaps. And that's really where our activation now is because we know the patients are there. We know they're diagnosed with an echo, but they're not moving. And so it's just a matter of tapping into those patients in the right way and getting the accelerated through the system."", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', ""What's fair to say though is, in the past few years, we have done many pilots, many initiatives. We have extracted so many learnings. What we are doing right now is scaling. We are scaling and spending. We are spending resources in Q4 last year, this year and the next few years. So you are going to see more and more because we believe there are so many patients in need not receiving a treatment."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research.', 'Christopher Thomas Pasquale', ""I think I heard you mention patient activation, not just with regard to TAVR, but also as an important part of the EVOQUE rollout. I was encouraged to hear from a lot of physicians back at TCT, they're actually seeing many more of these tricuspid patients in their practice. So as you think about the initial launch here, do you expect to have to do a lot of work establishing referral channels? Or do you think there are already a large number of these patients identified and waiting for treatment?"", 'Daveen Chopra', ""Chris, this is Daveen. No, I appreciate it. I think at least my reference toward in patient activation and how we think about in TMTT is more over the longer term, right? And we are thinking about there's so much learning that TAVR is happening where, yes, we're doing some things right now. We're testing small things, but it's really about over the midterm, how do we kind of help scale patient activation in a way that kind of TAVR has been doing and really helps drive kind of organic growth and a number of patients being diagnosed and being referred to heart teams.Well, the other point I'll kind of make is that right now, I think that most of our time or a lot of our energy is really about building capabilities for getting centers up and running. So there are a lot of patients in the center. If you look at how our trials enrolled, especially the TRISCEND II trial. It enrolled really fast and enrolled very quickly. So we know there's definitely groups of patients who now are looking for options. They've been diagnosed and looking for options. But as we grow over time, we're going to continue to try to build off that and leverage a lot of those kind of TAVR kind of patient activation efforts."", 'Christopher Thomas Pasquale', ""That's helpful. And then a lot of focus, I think, rightly so on the new U.S. products. But you've got a couple in Europe, SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA and MITRIS RESILIA both rolling out there. Are the price premiums for those products in Europe the same as what we see in the U.S.? And do you think you can get similar adoption in what is a more price-sensitive market."", 'Larry L. Wood', ""Yes. I'll start and then if Wayne has anything to add, he can. The price premiums are different in the different markets because it all depends on kind of where the starting price was. So we went for larger premiums in Europe than what we did in the U.S. And so a more price-sensitive market, obviously, that's more of an issue. So we've seen more rapid adoption of our RESILIA-based therapies in the U.S. But we continue to see this growing in Europe. And I think we're really gaining momentum on our Resilient platforms in total. I don't know Wayne, did you have anything to add?"", 'Wayne Markowitz', ""Maybe just a couple of things I'd add was just if you think about our global adoption of the RESILIA premium technologies, we're also seeing tremendous growth out of the emerging markets. And a lot of those emerging markets are finding and identifying patients that can be best treated surgically with the RESILIA portfolio. So it's been certainly a global effort, but strong growth out of the emerging markets even with premium technology, which is encouraging to see too."", 'Operator', 'And our final question for today comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.', 'Danielle Joy Antalffy', ""Great. Larry, just a quick question for you on the progress trial on moderate aortic stenosis. I mean I know this isn't the first time we're hearing about the speed of enrollment in that trial but it's certainly a positive signal. And I guess my question for you is, is there anything to read into the potential opportunity there based on the speed of enrollment. Was there anything unique about the trial that allowed us to enroll so much faster than you guys expected? And what could this mean for potential approval, number one. But number two, just more broadly, once we see this data uplift across the market."", 'Larry L. Wood', ""Yes. Thanks, Danielle. I think clinical trial enrollment, I think, is always an important marker for the opportunity. And I think having rapid clinical trial enrollment, I think, does certainly speak to that opportunity. I think it also speaks to the fact that everything we've done in the Partner Series trial has still been just isolated to severe aortic stenosis. And most of that work is, is it better to do surgery, is it better to do TAVR. What I think there's a lot of enthusiasm and excitement about now is actually attacking the disease in a different way and saying, should we be waiting until patients are literally at the end stage before we even consider doing anything? Or should we be evaluating those patients sooner. And as -- and I think that could have two benefits.The first is, if we showed that treating moderate patients is important and has real advantages for those patients, then I think it could provide a real accelerant for those severe patients that aren't moving today. And I think we've seen that when we went from high risk to intermediate risk, we have the intermediate risk approvals, one of the biggest accelerations we saw was in the high-risk space. Because people are like, for having to debate in the intermediate, then high risk are automatic at this point.But I think the other thing about it is if we can show a benefit in these moderate patients, there's literally twice as many moderate patients as there are severe patients. And so when we think about long term and just continual opportunities to drive the market, I think that steady cadence of data with early TAVR coming later this year at TCT. And then we're talking about a couple of years, 2.5 years later, we get the progress trial. That's steady cadence of data, we think, is going to be important for informing patients and improving treatment rates."", 'Bernard J. Zovighian', ""So in closing, I am very proud about what we did the last year. 2023 was a great year. Strong performance across our 4 product groups globally. When I think about this year 2024, I'm super excited. We are going to have multiple breakthrough technologies, clinical trial in TAVR, TMTT and surgical. Here, we have a chance. The same way we did it in TAVR 20 years ago to shape the TMTT space with EVOQUE and providing basically a toolbox to physician to treat so many patients. So that is a very unique opportunity that we are taking very seriously. The spin-off of critical care. We are executing on this one, also in 2024. So I'm super confident that this year is going to be a super exciting year and we are going to be very well positioned to accelerate growth in 2025 and beyond.So with that, thanks for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott, Mark and I welcome any additional questions by telephone. Thank you, everyone."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may now disconnect.""]"

Investments in consumer goods also offer exposure to inflation-immune segments.', 'While the hedge fund underperformed the S&P 500, which gained 24% in 2023, its returns showed a significant improvement from 2022. As the overall equity market came under pressure in 2022 amid a ferocious sell-off triggered by runaway inflation and a push by the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, Dorsal Capital Management narrowly escaped losses with a 0.9% decline.

Even as the COVID-19 pandemic caused havoc in 2020, sending the markets into a tailspin, the hedge fund came on top, delivering 9.7% gains in the year's first half.

Walmart recently made news when it announced its plans to execute a 3-for-1 split, which will take its shares from $170 to under $60.', 'If Walmart is splitting its stock under $200, what does that mean for technology giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which trades at a hefty $1,200 per share today? Remarkably, the company has never split its stock.', 'Will that change?', 'While stock splits are common and often cheered by investors, there can be some misunderstanding about what they are and how they impact the stock.', 'Suppose you want to buy shares of Broadcom, but can\'t afford the $1,200 price tag. Some brokerage platforms let you buy fractional shares, or ""pieces"" of a stock, but some don\'t. Besides, trying to save the money to buy one share of stock can be a bit discouraging for some. It might not feel like you own a meaningful piece of Broadcom\'s business.', ""That's one reason why companies split their stock. Ultimately, companies want investors to desire their stock, and having a sky-high share price can turn some investors away unnecessarily, especially those who don't have money to buy a handful of shares at $1,200 a pop. This sentiment can trickle through to company employees, too. A high share price can make it harder for employees to manage their equity in the company."", 'Stock splits lower the share price to make accumulating stock easier for investors and more liquid for employees. It can also make it easier for companies that provide employees with stock-based compensation to manage their accounting.', ""Regardless of its effect on investor sentiment, stock splits don't fundamentally change the stock's valuation. Suppose you have a cake you want to share with three friends. You cut it into four slices. As you're about to serve it, four more friends show up and want some cake. What do you do? You cut it some more to make eight slices. Did the actual cake get bigger? No, everyone just got a smaller slice."", ""That's basically how stock splits work."", ""Nobody can know for sure whether Broadcom will take the step to split its stock. But there aren't that many stocks out there trading with share prices over $1,000 for a reason. The reason is exactly what I explained above: Investors tend to shy away from sky-high price tags."", 'Adding more fuel to this fire is the fact that Broadcom has been such an excellent investment in recent years. The business specializes in semiconductors for connective applications like networking, data centers, personal electronics, autonomous driving, and more. Semiconductor demand has increased as technology has advanced. First, it was the internet, then the cloud, and now, artificial intelligence (AI).', ""Look at Broadcom's eye-popping returns over just the past 10 years:"", 'Again, there are no promises, but splitting shares to make the price more digestible for interested retail investors and potentially continue this remarkable run makes a ton of sense.', 'Only time will tell what happens next.', ""A stock split doesn't fundamentally change anything about the stock as an investment. You should purchase shares of Broadcom because you believe it's an awesome company and can continue creating value. Speaking of value, the company is now approaching a $600 billion market cap. Despite that, the stock can still do well over the long term. That's the reason to buy this stock."", 'The world is becoming increasingly digital, and the semiconductor outlook looks bright. According to research by McKinsey & Co., Broadcom and other semiconductor stocks are in the early innings of a golden decade. Growth in end markets like automotive, data, and wireless communications could add hundreds of billions of dollars, pushing the market to $1 trillion annually by 2030.', ""Broadcom will surely see some of that upside, and the company's software investments seem to be working out. Analysts believe the company can grow earnings by an average of 14% annually over the long term. That's enough growth to create fantastic returns over time, even if the next decade isn't quite as prolific as the previous one."", ""The stock's valuation is a potential downside, a touch expensive at 26 times analysts' estimated 2024 earnings. It wouldn't hurt to wait for a pullback to buy shares, but the long-term direction of Broadcom seems positive, with or without a stock split."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with RJF.', ""On February 7, 2024, Raymond James Financial Inc (NYSE:RJF) filed its latest 10-Q report, revealing a financial landscape characterized by both robust growth and emerging challenges. As a leading financial holding company with a diverse portfolio of wealth management, investment banking, asset management, and commercial banking services, RJF supports a vast network of financial advisors and boasts over $1.2 trillion in assets under administration. The recent filing indicates that RJF has achieved a net income of $498 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, with a notable increase in asset management and related administrative fees from $1,242 million in 2022 to $1,407 million in 2023. However, the company also faced a rise in non-interest expenses and a slight dip in net income available to common shareholders, from $507 million to $497 million. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of RJF's strategic position and future prospects."", ""Brand Power and Market Presence: Raymond James Financial Inc's reputation as a trusted financial services provider is one of its most significant strengths. The company's brand is synonymous with personalized wealth management and expert financial advice, which has helped it to maintain a loyal customer base. RJF's market presence is bolstered by its extensive network of over 8,000 financial advisors, which facilitates a wide-reaching service delivery and client engagement. The company's strong brand and market presence are further evidenced by its substantial assets under administration, exceeding $1.2 trillion, showcasing the trust and confidence that clients place in RJF's capabilities."", ""Financial Performance and Revenue Diversification: RJF's financial performance remains robust, with the latest 10-Q filing showing a year-over-year increase in net revenues from $2,786 million to $3,013 million. This growth is attributed to a rise in asset management and related administrative fees, as well as increases in brokerage revenues and investment banking. RJF's diversified revenue streams, with significant contributions from wealth management, investment banking, and asset management, provide a stable financial base and reduce reliance on any single market segment. The company's ability to generate consistent revenue across its operations is a testament to its strategic positioning and adaptability in a dynamic financial landscape."", 'Operational Costs and Expense Management: Despite its strong revenue growth, RJF faces challenges in managing operational costs. The 10-Q filing reveals an 11% increase in compensation, commissions, and benefits expenses, which has led to a higher compensation ratio of 63.8% compared to 62.3% in the previous year. Additionally, non-compensation expenses have risen by 16%, partly due to a one-time insurance settlement in the prior year. These growing expenses may impact profit margins and highlight the need for more effective cost control measures to ensure long-term financial sustainability.', ""Interest Rate Sensitivity and Economic Uncertainty: Raymond James Financial Inc's performance is sensitive to changes in interest rates, as evidenced by the significant increase in interest expense from $241 million to $507 million. This sensitivity poses a risk to the company's net interest income, particularly in an environment of economic uncertainty and potential rate fluctuations. Moreover, the shift in deposit balances towards higher-cost Extended Sweep Program (ESP) accounts has contributed to increased interest expenses, underscoring the need for a more balanced approach to deposit management."", 'Technological Advancements and Digital Transformation: The financial industry is rapidly evolving with the integration of technology in service delivery. RJF has the opportunity to leverage technological advancements to enhance its digital platforms, improve operational efficiency, and offer innovative products and services. By investing in technology, the company can attract a broader client base, particularly tech-savvy millennials, and stay ahead of industry trends.', 'Expansion of Services and Geographic Reach: With a strong foothold in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., RJF has the potential to expand its services and geographic reach further. The company can explore strategic partnerships, acquisitions, or organic growth initiatives to enter new markets and diversify its client base. This expansion would enable RJF to tap into emerging markets and capitalize on global economic growth, thereby driving revenue and increasing market share.', ""Regulatory Compliance and Legal Risks: As a financial institution, RJF is subject to stringent regulatory requirements and oversight. The company must navigate a complex regulatory landscape, which includes compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and other regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant fines, legal costs, and reputational damage. Additionally, RJF's involvement in various legal actions and investigations poses a threat to its operational stability and financial health."", 'Market Volatility and Competitive Pressure: RJF operates in a highly competitive industry where market volatility can significantly impact investment banking activities, asset valuations, and client investment decisions. The company must contend with the cyclical nature of financial markets and the aggressive strategies of competitors. To mitigate these threats, RJF needs to maintain a strong risk management framework and continue to differentiate its services through exceptional client experiences and value-added offerings.', 'In conclusion, Raymond James Financial Inc (NYSE:RJF) exhibits a strong market presence and financial performance, driven by its diversified revenue streams and expansive advisory network. However, the company must address challenges related to operational costs and interest rate sensitivity', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

In our last earnings call, we shared a bit about the synergy traction we're seeing between the legacy Evoqua Services business and Xylem's dewatering business. And since them, we've seen the momentum continue to build as the team wins in the marketplace with our combined offering."", ""On January 1, we made it even easier for our customers to access the full breadth of our capabilities with the creation of the Water Solutions and Services segment, effectively combining Xylem and Evoqua services offerings in a realigned segment structure. The move supports the continuing growth of our services business and expansion of recurring revenues. And it puts Xylem in an even stronger position to capture value by serving industrial water customers who are increasingly outsourcing water management as water stresses intensify. Looking forward, we are starting strong in 2024 with momentum from our outperformance in '23 and continued healthy demand in our major end-markets, though we're keeping a close eye on demand dynamics in China, and are taking a prudent view of end-markets for Applied Water, which is our most cyclical segment."", ""Our backlog across the business is a source of continuing strength, especially at M&CS. We also feel very confident in our ability to drive continuing margin expansion by focusing our energy on the parts of the business delivering the greatest value. Overall, we're well-positioned for profitable and sustainable growth. We expect 2024 organic revenues to be up 3% to 5%, with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $4.00 and $4.20. I'll now turn it over to Bill to walk through the quarter's results and our outlook for 2024 in more detail."", 'Bill Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to slide five. As Matthew mentioned, we are pleased with the strong finish to 2023. The team has stayed focused and consistently delivered throughout the year, exceeding on our expectations on revenue and earnings per share for Q4 and the full-year. We continue to see resilient demand and are supported by our $5.1 billion backlog, which grew 5% organically for the year. Organic orders grew 10% in the quarter, with book-to-bill approximately 1 for the quarter, and greater than 1 for the full-year. Total revenues grew 41%, while organic revenues rose 9%, exceeding our guidance of 4% to 5%. Outperformance was led by M&CS and Water Infrastructure. All regions grew led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior year, with productivity savings, price, and higher volume more than offsetting inflation.', ""This reflects 33% incremental on the legacy Xylem performance. We finished the year with EBITDA margin of 18.9%, up nearly 200 basis points over prior year. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, above the high end of our guide by $0.03. When excluding the impacts of Evoqua, EPS was $1.10, up 10% over prior year. Our financial position remains robust with over $1 billion in cash, and available liquidity of approximately $2 billion. We ended the year with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 122%, exceeding our expectations and significantly improved versus last year. Please turn to slide six. Before I highlight each segment's fourth quarter performance, I want to touch on some changes you'll see in our earnings materials going forward. In the spirit of 80/20, we have simplified our earnings materials to focus on what is most important for investors."", 'To assist with the transition this quarter, we have provided our historical presentation format in the Appendix. And now, on to the segment performance, measurement and Control Solutions saw robust orders growth of 14%, with strength across the portfolio led by metrology and assessment services. Backlog is $2.3 billion and book-to-bill is above 1, a reflection of the strong demand for our AMI solutions and other digital offerings. MCS revenue is up 21% driven by metrology backlog execution and strong demand. We finished the quarter with improved EBITDA margins of 17.3%, up 220 basis points versus the prior year, and up 160 basis points sequentially on productivity, price, and higher volumes. Water Infrastructure also saw orders growth of 9% for the quarter, with strength across the portfolio, led by robust treatment demand globally.', 'Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 30% on organic growth of 9%, driven by robust OpEx demand across all regions. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 90 basis points driven by the impacts of legacy Evoqua. When excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 50 basis points primarily due to price, productivity, and volume more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. In Applied Water, although orders grew, book-to-bill was 0.9 times as we continue to work down our backlog and we saw softer demand environment in the U.S., our largest geography. Revenues were flat, in line with our guide, with the decline developed markets offset slightly by growth in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points, with productivity and price more than offsetting inflation and volume declines.', 'Integrated Solutions and Services, orders grew 5% on a pro forma basis, and book-to-bill was 1. Demand was driven by services. Pro forma revenue growth of 10% exceeded our expectations, as implied in our reported guidance, with healthy growth across the portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong, at 21.1%, driven by price realization and volume. Please turn to slide seven, I will cover our segment outlook for the year. As Matthew mentioned, in December, we announced the creation of Water Solutions and Services segment. We are providing organic revenue guidance based on our previous reporting segments. Later this month, we will provide recast financial information aligned to the new segments. However, we expect the segment guidance outlook to largely be in line with the new segment structure, and will update as needed in our Q1 earnings call.', 'In M&CS, we expected growth of low teens. Demand and order momentum for our AMI solutions remain strong. We expect to see sequential revenue improvement throughout 2024 supported by our robust backlog. In Water Infrastructure, we expect growth of mid-single digits. We expect resilient OpEx demand due to mission critical nature of our applications, and a healthy CapEx demand. We are continuing to closely monitor its office in China, where the majority of our business is in the utility end-market. In Applied Water, we expect a modest decline of low single digits. We continue to see pockets of softness across our end-markets, particularly in developed markets which make up about 80% of our business. We also expect to see headwinds as we lap price increases and our backlog returns to more historic levels.', ""ISS growth is expected to be mid single digits with growth across both capital and services. We continue to see strong activity in our funnel, particularly in high-growth verticals such as food and beverage, energy, and life sciences. This segment is supported by $1 billion in backlog and a durable service business model. And as a reminder, the ISS growth outlook is on an organic basis. Now, let's turn to slide eight for our 2024 and Q1 guidance. The growth outlook by segment translates to 2024 full revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, resulting in total revenue growth of 14% to 15%, organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. EBITDA margin is expected to be 19.4% to 19.9%. This represents 50 to 100 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity, and price offsetting inflation."", 'This yields an EPS range of $4 to $4.20, up 8% at the midpoint over prior year. We are expecting approximately $100 million of exit run-rate cost synergies in 2024, which is embedded in our guide. Free cash flow conversion for the year is expected to be 115% of net income. Drilling down on the first quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 36% to 38% range on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, up 170 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization, and productivity gains. This yield first quarter EPS of $0.80 to $0.85. We are entering the year with momentum and from a position of strength. Our balanced outlook reflects our strong commercial position and the durability of our portfolio.', ""While we also continue to monitor broader market conditions particularly in China in Applied Water which is our shortest cycle business. In the case of larger than expected volume declines, we are ready to take additional cost actions as needed to ensure continued focus on margin expansion. Overall, our expectations for the year remain positive as we build on a strong momentum. With that, please turn to slide nine. And, I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments."", ""Matthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. It's been incredibly exciting to step up as CEO at a time of such great momentum and opportunity for Xylem. I began the year by spending time with customers and colleagues in India and the Middle East. Bill and I started off in India. And, the scale of ambition there to modernize infrastructure and tackle the big water challenges is frankly awe-inspiring. We have an outstanding team there doing great work to serve customers from our localized R&D in manufacturing platform that gives us a real competitive advantage. And both India and the Middle East provide great reminders of the fundamental interconnectedness of economic value and social value creation in our business. These markets present expansive commercial opportunity."", ""And in both markets every project improves lives and increases sustainability of communities. We took some time out with colleagues in India to visit a school in a rural area outside of Bangalore. We got hands-on building a small scale water treatment system that now provides clean drinking water for the students and their community. I'll be honest. The experience of celebrating with those kids and their teachers as the clean water started to flow, well, it's just hard to describe. And you also know that the impact on educational outcomes, health, and quality of life is likely to be profound. That experience drove home for me not just the importance of what Xylem does but it reinforced the focus we are bringing into 2024. Whether it's a scale of a school or the scale of a megacity, we have to make it easier for customers and community to solve their big water challenges, reducing the complexity of water solutions that is our focus, simplifying water."", 'We have assembled the most advanced and most comprehensive portfolio of products, solutions, and services in the sector. The value creation opportunity in front of us is to make all that capability far easier for customers to access to empower them to solve their most critical water challenges and deliver great outcomes with far less complexity. We started the year with great pace with strong execution off the back of a great Q4 in 2023 across both legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua businesses. And our integration is well on track to deliver on the full value creation opportunity of the combination. Our end markets are resilient. And as long as the long-term trends in waters continue to intensify, our team is energized to take all of our capabilities to deliver even greater impact for our customers.', ""Our investment thesis remains robust. And we continue to execute on the strategy that has positioned us so strongly for further economic and social value creation. We look forward to sharing further insights into our priorities and strategic direction at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30, in Washington, D.C., one I hope many of you will join us. Now, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions."", 'See also 20 Best Places to Retire in Italy for US Citizens and 25 States with Lowest Percentage of College Graduates.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The ISO/SAE 21434 standard has emerged to set requirements for road vehicle cybersecurity risk management processes. These cybersecurity requirements help regulate automotive products across the complete product lifecycle—from concept through design, production, maintenance and decommissioning. Adhering to these standards, Microchip Technology’s (Nasdaq: MCHP) corporate processes associated with specific automotive work products have recently been audited by a third party, UL Solutions, and certified as compliant to ISO/SAE 21434.', 'Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in conjunction with the Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) International, the ISO/SAE 21434 standard was developed to help organizations define cybersecurity policies and manage risk. It is a demanding specification with 45 security categories, known as work products, each of which specifies a unique set of requirements that encompass all aspects of designing electrical and electronic systems for road vehicles, from ICs and software to firmware and libraries.', 'The ISO/SAE 21434 designation also confirms that a certified corporate cybersecurity management system is in place. This verifies that cybersecurity is a priority focus at the organization, from executive leadership to all organizational disciplines including the design, test, product, applications, marketing, quality, verification and validation teams. Stakeholders involved in the product lifecycle are required to complete cybersecurity training and meet designated qualifications. A Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) methodology is also incorporated at multiple stages of the product lifecycle when devices will be integrated into automotive cybersecurity-related platforms.', ""“Security is a core pillar at Microchip and the ISO/SAE 21434 certification is proof of our dedication to maintaining high standards in automotive cybersecurity,” said Matthias Kaestner, corporate vice president of Microchip's automotive business. “Our customers can be confident that Microchip is a trusted security advisor with the appropriate expertise to guide them through their automotive cybersecurity design journey.”"", 'While each OEM is responsible for proving compliance at the vehicle level, ISO/SAE 21434 encourages all companies in the production ecosystem to play a role in proactively helping manage cybersecurity threats. Customers utilizing electronic control units that incorporate Microchip’s security products, designed within the ISO/SAE 21434 certified process framework, can be relieved of the arduous task of reviewing thousands of pages of process documentation to determine compliance. This reduces the burden placed on Tier-1s and OEMs to prove they have a strong foundation in security.', 'To learn more about Microchip’s ISO/SAE 21434 certification and automotive products, visit the automotive security page on the Microchip website.', 'Resources: High-res images available through Flickr or editorial contact (feel free to publish): Image: https://www.flickr.com/photos/microchiptechnology/53496216708/sizes/l/', 'About Microchip Technology:Microchip Technology Inc. is a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions.

Gartner drove another strong performance in the fourth quarter. We delivered high single-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow came in above expectations. Gartner delivers incredible client value in any macroeconomic environment. In 2023, the world experienced multiple disruptions. They impacted enterprises in dramatically different ways. For example, high interest rates affected capital-intensive industries and financial institutions such as regional banks, high inflation rates had an outsized effect on industries such as health care. Geopolitical polarization and conflict drove increases in military and defense spending while affecting supply chains, more shifts in how and where people work affected real estate, live events and entertainment and other industries.', ""Cybersecurity attacks became even more frequent while getting stronger and more disruptive. And we saw a significant leap in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, or AI, which fueled even more complexity. We serve leaders in every enterprise across every industry and every geography.

Gartner delivers actionable objective insight that drive smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission-critical priorities. We guide the leaders who shape the world.

Consulting revenue grew 8% for the full year. We saw growth in labor-based consulting and record results in contract optimization for the full year. We are introducing 2024 guidance, which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios with opportunity for upside.', ""In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver incredible client value, whether our clients are struggling, thriving or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success or into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time. And we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. As we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders."", ""This produces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian."", 'Craig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better than expected as we continue to execute very well in a complex environment. Our financial performance for the full year 2023 included global contract value and consolidated revenue growth of 8%, EBITDA of $1.5 billion, diluted adjusted EPS of $11.33 and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. We are introducing 2024 guidance, which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios with opportunity for upside. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 67%. EBITDA was $386 million, ahead of our guidance primarily as a result of disciplined cost management.', 'Adjusted EPS was $3.04 and free cash flow was $196 million. We finished the quarter with 20,237 associates, up 5%, excluding the 2023 divestiture and about the same as Q3. We have a great team across Gartner, driven by a very compelling associate value proposition. Moving into 2024, we are in an excellent position from a talent and tenure perspective. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% FX-neutral. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-subscription revenue performance in the quarter reflects a shift to higher-quality traffic. While this action has a short-term effect on revenue, we expect it will drive higher prices and increase revenue over time. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with the prior year period as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel.', 'For the full year 2023, research revenues increased by 6%, both as reported and FX neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%. Contract Value, or CV, was $4.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 8% versus the prior year. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes the first quarter 2023 divestiture. We expect new business to be a leading indicator for retention and, in turn, contract value growth. We had the highest one month of new business dollars ever in December 2023. For the fourth quarter, CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders increased double digits as well. CV from tech vendors was about flat versus the prior year and up sequentially.', ""Tech vendor CV continued the quarterly improvement we saw in Q3. Tech vendor new business was up high single digits in Q4, marking the first year-over-year increase in 2023. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $180 million. As we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across almost all of our enterprise size categories. The small category, which has the largest tech vendor mix grew modestly. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries."", ""Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $134 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, reflecting net growth even before the addition of new clients. In the fourth quarter, IT enterprise function leaders wallet retention was consistent with historical GTS levels. GTS new business increased 12% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased mid-teens compared to 2022. New business with tech vendors increased high single digits in the quarter. GTS quota-bearing head count was about flat year-over-year. With the dynamic territory planning we introduced a few years ago, the catch-up hiring we did last year and our teams moving up 10-year curve, we're well positioned for growth moving into 2024."", 'Operationally, we are continuously allocating resources to the best near-term opportunities even as we ensure we are well positioned to capture the large addressable market opportunity over time. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. The majority of our GBS practices grew at double-digit rates. Growth was led by supply chain, legal and HR. GBS CV increased $46 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 107% for the quarter, reflecting strong net growth with our existing clients. GBS new business was up 13% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2022.', ""This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement. As we do each year at this time, we've provided 2 years of quarterly historical contract value data updated to 2024 FX rates in the appendix of the earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $214 million, up 14% year-over-year. Contribution margin in the quarter was 50%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 11 destination conferences in the quarter, all in person. For the full year 2023, we delivered an all-time high revenue of $505 million, which was an increase of 30% on a reported basis and 29% FX neutral. Gross contribution margin was 50%. Fourth quarter consulting revenues were $128 million compared with $138 million in 2022 when we saw a record performance in the Contract Optimization business."", 'Consulting contribution margin was 27% in the fourth quarter, affected by revenue mix and growth hiring. Labor-based revenues were $99 million, up 3% versus Q4 of last year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $162 million, increasing 21% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. We delivered $29 million of Contract Optimization revenue in the quarter. This part of our business is highly variable. For the second half of 2023, revenues were $62 million, up from the second half of 2022 when we delivered our largest ever quarter in Q4. Full year Consulting revenue was up 7% on a reported basis and 8% FX-neutral. Gross contribution margin was 35% compared to 39% in 2022. Consolidated cost of services increased 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 10% on an FX-neutral basis.', 'The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our future growth. SG&A increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 8% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $386 million compared to $421 million last year. Fourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected disciplined expense management. EBITDA for the full year was almost $1.5 billion, a 1% increase over 2022 on a reported basis and up 2% FX-neutral. Depreciation in the quarter of $26 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $19 million. This was down $9 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances.', 'The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 24% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 15% for the quarter. The full year tax rate for the calculation of adjusted net income was 22%. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.04 compared with $3.70 last year. We had 79 million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter. This is a reduction of about 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the fourth quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $11.33, up modestly from 2022. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $224 million, up 10% compared to last year.', 'CapEx for the quarter was $28 million, down $4 million as a result of catch-up spend on technology investments in 2022, which normalize this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $196 million, up 19% compared to last year. Free cash flow for the full year was almost $1.1 billion, a 6% increase versus 2022. Free cash flow on a rolling four quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 71% of EBITDA. Adjusting for the Q1 divestiture, the full year free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income would have been 138%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. We have a new slide in the earnings supplement, which shows the conversion from both EBITDA and GAAP net income to free cash flow on a rolling four quarter basis.', 'The past 2 years have had some unusual items affecting the conversion, including insurance proceeds related to pandemic conference cancellations and the 2023 divestiture. We expect about a 4 to 6 point difference between EBITDA margin and free cash flow margins in a typical year. The normal free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income is 140% to 160%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1.3 billion of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.', 'Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.3 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $158 million of stock during the fourth quarter and more than $600 million for the full year. At the end of December, we had about $1 billion of authorization for repurchases remaining, and we expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. Before providing the 2024 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2024. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects.', 'Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. The outlook for 2024 research revenue growth is a function of three primary factors: first, 2023 ending contract value; second, the timing of growth bottoming and the slope of the reacceleration, and third, the performance of nonsubscription revenue. Starting with the research subscription revenue, which was 76% of 2023 consolidated revenue. Our guidance reflects CV bottoming and reaccelerating during 2024. First quarter and first half NCVI are important inputs to calendar 2024 revenue growth. We have taken a prudent view of NCVI phasing because Q1 is a seasonally important quarter for tech vendor renewals.', ""With the majority of our contracts being multiyear, some haven't come up for renewal during the tech sector's recalibration. And research subscription revenue will likely bottom about one quarter after contract value growth bottoms. If new business continues to perform well and retention is better than we've incorporated into the plan, there would be upside to our guidance. The nonsubscription revenue was about 6% of consolidated revenue in 2023. In this part of the business, we help small business buyers find the best software for their needs and help sellers find customers. This adds a lot of tangible value for both groups. The outlook built into the 2024 guidance reflects a shift to higher-quality traffic sources. As I mentioned, this affects revenue in the short term, but we expect it to drive higher prices and increased revenue over time."", ""For conferences, which was about 9% of 2023 revenue, we are basing our guidance on the 51 in-person destination conferences we have planned for 2024. We expect similar seasonality to what we saw in 2023, with Q4 the largest quarter, followed by Q2. We have very good visibility into 2024 revenue with the majority of what we've guided already under contract. This is consistent with last year and ahead of historical levels. For consulting, which was also about 9% of 2023 revenue, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization has had several very strong years. It's also seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. We've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment."", ""We remain focused on aligning expense growth with CV growth. This is the best way for us to balance short-term margins while investing for long-term sustained double-digit growth. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect a more typical cadence than we've seen in a while. We are investing for future growth even as we have taken a prudent view of the timing of revenue flowing into the P&L. We recommend thinking about expenses sequentially with notable seasonality driven by the conferences calendar and merit increases. Our plan for mid to high single-digit sales headcount growth for 2024 reflects our commitment to invest for future growth while delivering on our margin targets. We have the recruiting capacity to go faster depending on how the year plays out, and we have other levers like increased tenure to support CV growth in 2024."", 'At current rates, FX will be approximately neutral to growth for the full year. Our guidance for 2024 is as follows, we expect research revenue of at least $5.15 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. The research revenue guidance reflects a prudent plan for NCVI performance and the recalibration of nonsubscription part of the business. The guidance reflects subscription revenue growth in the high single digits. We expect conferences revenue of at least $560 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 10%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $530 million, which is growth of about 3% FX-neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.24 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%. We expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.435 billion, which results in an EBITDA margin of at least 23%.', 'We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $10.55 per share. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.065 billion. This reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of above 140%. Our guidance is based on 79 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect to deliver EBITDA of at least $335 million. We performed well this year despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. Global CV grew high single digits in the quarter with enterprise function leaders CV growing double digits. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS performance exceeded our expectations, and we introduced achievable guidance with opportunity for upside. We repurchased more than $600 million in stock during 2023 and more than $3 billion in the past 3 years.', ""We remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions."", 'Operator?', 'See also 15 Countries that Produce the Best Software Engineers and 15 Cheapest Countries to Get Permanent Residency Heading into 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The dividend payout ratio (which divides dividends paid out by funds from operations, or FFO) shows whether the company can sustain the dividend off its current cash flows. Generally speaking, I like to see a number under 80%, because the company still needs to be able to reinvest some cash in growing the business (and tuck away some for a rainy day)."", ""Realty Income's dividend payout ratio is 74%, so the payout looks pretty safe to me."", ""Of course, dividend safety isn't just about maintaining the dividend. It's also about the company's ability to grow it further. Realty Income has grown steadily for decades due to its patience to hold cash until a great deal presents itself.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter performance was very strong. For the fourth quarter, organic growth of 4.4% exceeded our expectations and full year organic growth was 4.1%. Excluding acquisition transaction fees related primarily to Flywheel, operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.3%. For the full year, operating profit margin adjusted for certain non-GAAP items was 15.2%. Earnings per share for the quarter adjusted for acquisition transaction fees was $2.20, up 5.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, EPS adjusted for certain non-GAAP items was $7.41, an increase of 6.9% compared to the full year 2022."", ""In 2023, we generated approximately $1.9 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong and continue to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. On January 2, we closed the acquisition of Flywheel Digital. It is the biggest acquisition in Omnicom's history and brings scaled capabilities in the fastest-growing segments of the industry, retail, media and digital commerce. Flywheel enables brands to sell goods across digital marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, Alibaba and more than 100 other marketplaces around the world. Flywheel opens up an entirely new market opportunity for Omnicom, transforming us from an advertising and marketing focused company to a marketing and sales-focused company."", ""We can now seamlessly integrate end-to-end services from brand media to precision marketing to e-commerce and in-store comers, ultimately delivering superior results for our clients. In January, we began combining Omni's audience and behavioral data with marketplace point of purchase sales data in Flywheel's Commerce Cloud, giving us an unmatched set of data not only to more effectively drive sales for clients, but to be fully able to measure return on advertising spend. It's a unique offering that no one has been able to achieve, and our competitors can't match. I'm also proud to inform you that last week, Flywheel captured its first significant win as part of Omnicom, winning the highly owned e-commerce business in Europe from one of our competitors."", 'This is a unique partnership and opportunity. In January, we welcomed CEO, Duncan Painter and more than 2,000 Flywheelers around the world to Omnicom, and we are excited about what we can achieve for our clients together. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Coffee & TV, a UK-based creative studio that specializes in CGI and visual effects. The acquisition is part of our strategy to leverage the scale of our production operations and launch a holistic suite of global content and production services under a single unit, Omnicom Content Studios. Omnicom Content Studios creates content for brands across all consumer experiences and touch points from long and short-form videos to social, experiential, digital and everything in between. In addition to these acquisitions, we continue to invest in high-growth areas through internal investments and partnerships.', ""Last month at CES, we introduced several new ways to offer planning and measurement in the booming area of influencers. We announced several first-of-the-kind partnerships with TikTok, Google, Amazon and Meta to optimize the use of influences, seamlessly integrate creator assets in campaigns and measure influencer-driven commerce. In November, we announced the first-mover collaboration with Getty Images that provides us early access to this new generative AI tool. It pairs Getty's library of creative content with Omni's data and AI technology. So our agencies can produce commercially safe and legally indemnified customized images for our clients. In 2023, we launched Omni Assist, a virtual assistant our people use to create, plan and execute ad campaigns using the trove of data in Omni."", ""Omni Assist accesses Open AI's GPT miles through Microsoft. As the first holding company and second company overall to be giving full access to Open AI models in Microsoft Azure environment, we have a significant first-mover advantage, allowing us to experiment, prototype and launch applications within our platform before any other organization. Historically, we've invested tens of millions of dollars in AI. Going forward, Generative AI investments and partnerships to enhance our platforms and educate our knowledge workers are expected to require greater resources. These investments will result in increased productivity and success for our clients. From e-commerce to influencers to Generative AI, we are investing in all the areas that will shape the future of our industry."", 'When these capabilities are combined with our legendary creativity, we remain positioned at the forefront of change in innovation. In new business, we had a very successful 2023. We secured record business with Amazon, Beiersdorf, HSBC, Jaguar, Land Rover, Novartis, Phillips, Telstra, Uber, Under Armour, Vans and Virgin Voyages, among others. And we closed the year with exciting news that BMW consolidated its U.S. creative, digital and CRM and its media accounts with us. Before I discuss our outlook for 2024, I want to welcome the newest member of our Board of Directors, Casey Santos, who was recently appointed as an independent director and a member of the Finance Committee. Casey joins one of the most diverse boards within the Fortune 500.', ""Now at 11 members, our Board is proud to have seven women and six diverse members. Casey's deep expertise in technology makes her a valuable addition to our Board. I also want to thank our people around the world for helping us successfully close out 2023. Your dedication and commitment to do outstanding work allow our agencies, clients and Omnicom to succeed. We entered 2024 from a position of strength, supported by our solid financial performance and balance sheet, new business wins and key strategic investments in the areas that will drive significant growth in the years ahead. While we continue to plan cautiously, given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment based on current marketing conditions, we are targeting 2024 organic revenue growth between 3.5% to 5%."", ""Our range of organic growth during the year will be impacted by new business won in the fourth quarter which doesn't positively impact us until the second quarter and Flywheel's growth, which is typically stronger in the second half of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?"", ""Philip Angelastro: Thanks, John. We finished the year on a strong note in terms of revenue growth and profitability, even though the business environment was uncertain in 2023. As we look towards 2024, we're optimistic about the performance of our agencies and an improving economy. Let me spend a few minutes reviewing the financial details of the quarter and then we'll open the lines up for questions and answers. Let's start with a review of our revenue performance on Slide 4. Organic growth in the quarter was 4.4%. The impact on foreign currency translation increased reported revenue by 1.2%. If rates stay where they are currently, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation will be close to flat in Q1, 2024 and for the full year."", ""The net impact of acquisition and disposition revenue on reported revenue was negative 0.7%, primarily reflecting the sale in Q2 of '23 of our research businesses. In 2024, we expect a positive contribution beginning in the first quarter with an increase of about 1.5% and around 2% for the full year, reflecting recent acquisitions and are having moved past recent dispositions. For the full year, organic revenue growth was 4.1%, this was in line with our revised guidance of 3.5% to 5%. We made some good progress toward this target, despite a challenging comparison to 9.4% growth in 2022 and an uncertain macroeconomic environment during the year. As John discussed, organic revenue growth outlook for the full year 2024 is between 3.5% and 5%. Now let's turn to Slide 5 to review our organic revenue growth by discipline."", 'During the quarter, advertising and media growth was very strong at 9.3%, once again driven by Global Media performance, which was partially offset by softer results from our advertising agencies. Precision marketing growth contracted 1.1%, reflecting a difficult comp to 11.5% growth in Q4 of 2022 and cycling some client spending reductions from earlier in the year. As we look forward to 2024, we expect this to once again be one of our fastest-growing disciplines. Commerce and branding grew by 1% compared to growth of 7.5% last year, driven primarily by growth in specialty production, offset reductions in the quarter at our branding and commerce agencies. Experiential was down 8%, reflecting a difficult comp of 17% growth in Q4 of 2022 with the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, primarily offset by strong growth in Europe in the quarter, while quarterly results can be choppy based on the timing of certain client events.', ""Experiential remains a solid business and is important to our clients' marketing plans. Execution and support declined by 0.4% with mixed results that included a solid performance in field marketing. Public relations declined 2.9% in the quarter due to difficult comps related to the U.S. midterm elections of 2022, when growth exceeded 12%, as well as softness in certain international markets. Finally, Healthcare continued its steady growth of 3.6% during the quarter. Turning to geographic growth on Slide 6, we saw growth in our five largest markets offset again by declines in Canada and the cyclical impact of experiential revenue in Middle East and Africa. The U.S. was up 0.6% in the quarter on solid performances by advertising and media, led by media, and our healthcare businesses, offset primarily by execution and support, public relations and commerce and branding."", ""Slide 7 shows our revenue by industry sector for the full year and the quarter. Looking at the full year which tends to eliminate the volatility of client changes in the quarter, we saw a notable increase of 2 points in automotive and 1 point increases in both food and beverage and financial services. Weaker markets in technology and entertainment, which have been discussed widely in the industry over the course of the year, resulted in reductions of 3 points and 1 point, respectively. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at our expenses. In the fourth quarter, salary and related service costs were higher due to increased staffing levels, but were down as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, driven by our repositioning actions earlier in the year and through ongoing changes in our global employee mix."", ""Third-party service costs increased in connection with the growth in our revenues. We generated profit on these costs and the higher levels in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to '22 were driven primarily by strong growth in our media business. Our disposition activity during the quarter and the year did not have much of an impact on this cost category. Third-party incidental costs were close to the same level as last year and reflect client-related travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs that a bill declines directly at our cost with no profit. Occupancy and other costs were down in both dollar amount and relative to revenue, driven by ongoing rationalizations in our real estate portfolio. SG&A expenses were up primarily due to $14.5 million in professional fees related to acquisition costs incurred in the quarter, the majority of which related to Flywheel."", ""Excluding these costs, quarterly SG&A levels were comparable to last year. Now let's turn to Slide 9 and look at our quarterly and annual income statement. To make the numbers more comparable, the table and footnotes describe some of the other adjustments that were made during this year and last year that we discussed on prior calls. Our operating income margin was negatively impacted by $14.5 million of costs in connection with the Flywheel acquisition, as I just discussed; adjusting for this amount results in an operating income margin of 16.3% and an EBITDA margin of 16.8%. For the full year, our adjusted operating income margin was 15.2%, within our expected range of 15% to 15.4%. As a result of the Flywheel acquisition, we'll have higher levels of amortization expense than past dues and we will be focusing our margin expectations on EBITDA."", 'We continue to expect integration costs, as well as operating synergies and related to the Flywheel acquisition during 2024 and the acquisition will be accretive to diluted EPS adjusted for amortization expense by the fourth quarter. For the full year 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of reported revenue to be close to flat with last year. Also in this slide, you can see that our non-GAAP adjusted income tax rate of 26% for the full year 2023 and was comparable to 2022. We do not expect the Flywheel business to change our tax rate outlook for 2024, but the 2024 rate will be negatively impacted, primarily related to increases in the statutory rates of certain international countries. For full year 2024, we expect our rates to approximate 27%.', 'Acquisition costs related to Flywheel and better performance at agencies with minority shareholders contributed to a decrease in reported net income of 1%, but an increase of 2.1% and on an adjusted basis. Lastly, adjusted diluted EPS of $2.20 for the fourth quarter increased 5.3% from last year. For the year, adjusted EPS increased by 6.9%. Slide 10 is our cash flow performance for the year. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in operating capital. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.9 billion, an increase of 6.5%. This increase was driven in part from operational improvements compared to 2022 and the use of operating capital, which we expect to improve further in the future. Regarding our uses of cash, we used $563 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $71 million for dividends and non-controlling interest shareholders.', ""Our capital expenditures were $78 million, similar to last year and we expect 2024 levels to be higher due to growth investments at Flywheel. Total acquisition payments were $249 million, although we closed the Flywheel acquisition on January 2, 2024, using cash-on-hand of approximately $845 million. It remains our intention, as we stated in the October 30 announcement to finance two-third of the purchase price with new debt, which I'll discuss in a moment. Finally, our stock repurchase activity, net of proceeds from stock plans was $535 million year-to-date within our expected range. Our capital allocation in 2024 will be consistent with our practice of returning cash to shareholders through a healthy dividend, making strategic acquisitions that lead to accelerated growth and using a portion of residual cash to repurchase common stock."", 'Since 2024 began with the closing of a larger-than-normal acquisition, we expect the total share repurchases in 2024 and or approximate 50% of our recent average. Slide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, the book value of our outstanding debt was $5.6 billion. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter other than foreign exchange translations. Our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program remains undrawn, and our cash equivalents and short-term investments were $4.4 billion. We will continue to monitor the credit markets throughout 2024, and we expect to enter the debt markets to finance approximately $550 million or 2/3 of the $845 million we spent on Flywheel acquisition.', ""And during the year, we will refinance the $750 million of 3.625% senior notes, which are due November 1, 2024. Financing the Flywheel acquisition will increase our interest expense in 2024. It's also likely that refinancing November notes will increase interest expense by some amount, but it is too early to estimate. For 2024, we expect that our internal financing of the Flywheel acquisition in early January with cash on hand prior to an expected financing of two-third of the purchase price, coupled with a decline in global interest rates. Will lead to lower interest income in 2024 compared to 2023. Slide 12 presents our historical returns on two important performance metrics for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023. Omnicom's return on invested capital is 26% and return on equity was 41%, both reflecting very strong performance."", 'Healthy returns like these reflect the strength of our industry our operating discipline and the preservation of our conservative balance sheet.

In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Should You Invest in CRM?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.20.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.

Parker-Hannifin Corporation PH, IDEX Corporation IEX, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

Some industry players offer power transmission products, bearings, engineered fluid power components and systems, industrial rubber products, vapor-abrasive blasting equipment, vehicle-powered truck refrigeration systems, adhesive, gel coat equipment, flow-control components, and linear motion components. In addition, industrial manufacturing companies reconstruct and assemble pumps, valves, speed reducers and hydraulic motors.

A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. However, the manufacturing sector has been showing signs of gradual improvement. In January, the New Order Index increased 4.7 percentage points from December 2023. The uptick in new orders, in conjunction with the slowdown in inflation, augurs well for industrial manufacturing companies.', 'Easing Supply-Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report’s Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the 16th straight month in January. Easing supply-chain issues should support industrial manufacturing companies’ growth in 2024. Additionally, an anticipated reduction in raw material costs should aid the bottom line of the industry participants. A surge in the e-commerce business has also proved beneficial.', 'Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy: The industry participants focus on an acquisition-based growth strategy to expand their network and product offerings. This helps them foray into new markets and solidify their competitive position. Exposure to various end markets helps industrial manufacturing companies offset risks associated with a single market.

Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be allowed on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."", 'Michael Florin', ""Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings releases for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments."", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""For the second quarter in succession, News Corp has achieved growth in both revenue and profitability. And we believe there are strong prospects for further growth as difficult, inauspicious macroeconomic conditions ease in some of our markets. We saw particularly robust results across the 3 core pillars of our company: Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services, where there was a resounding improvement in Australia in Q2. And there are early signs of recovery in the U.S. residential sector after the most sluggish market conditions in almost 3 decades. Given the potential of our world-leading brands, we remain intent on creating long-term value for investors. And as part of our commitment, our diligent, concerted review of the company's structure continues apace. Looking at the top line results. News Corp's second quarter revenues rose 3% to $2.6 billion, and profitability surged 16%, marking the third consecutive quarter of profit growth in testing economic times. Our net income for the quarter rose to $183 million from $94 million in the same quarter last year, while our reported EPS was $0.27 against $0.12 for the same period last year. The company's digital progress and prowess are increasingly evident. Halfway through fiscal 2024, digital now comprises approximately 52% of all revenues. That is more than an e-evolution. It is an e-revolution, one that has touched and transformed every element of every business, and we are far from satisfied, far from complacent, far from completion. We are seeing the collective benefit of our conscious strategic shift away from potentially volatile advertising revenues to growth in circulation and subscription revenues. In fiscal 2014, nearly half of News Corp revenues were from advertising, with 31% from circulation and subscriptions. There has been a fundamental metamorphosis. In the first half of the fiscal year, advertising had preceded to 16%, with circulation of subscriptions surging to 44%. Overall, News Corp as of Q2 had over 7 million subscriptions to our news brands, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, The Times and Sunday Times, The Australian and other publications. And we have an additional 4.3 million paid subscribers at Foxtel in Australia, which includes our popular streaming services Kayo and Binge. And those figures don't include the growing number of loyal subscribers at our professional information business at Dow Jones, where the average retention rate is comfortably above 90%. Artificial intelligence, with all its permutations and perturbations, will play an increasingly important role at most businesses. We expect to be a core content provider for generative AI companies who need the highest quality, timely content to ensure the relevance of their products. The [corny kilo] cliche is that AI companies are selling the picks and shovels during the seeming gold rush. Well, we are selectively reselling gold nuggets and those crucial negotiations are at an advanced stage. It is reassuring that certain digital companies appreciate the value of integrity, quality and creativity. And while certain other media companies prefer litigation, we prefer consultation as the former is merely creating a gold rush for lawyers. Courtship is preferable to courtrooms. We are wooing, not suing. But let's be clear, in my view, those who are repurposing our content without approval are stealing. They are undermining creativity. Counterfeiting is not creating, and the AI world is replete with content counterfeiters. I would like to compliment Sam Altman of OpenAI, who has shown a clear understanding of the social importance of journalism. He also appears to have emerged unscathed from his first visit to Davos, where there is always attitude at altitude. We are hopeful that, again, News Corp will be able to set meaningful global precedence with digital companies that will assist journalists and journalism and ensure that gen AI is not fueled by digital drops. We speak of the AI hallucinating, yet we, as a society, are hallucinating if we don't focus firmly on provenance at a time when even the very words misinformation and disinformation have themselves become sources of misinformation and disinformation. Too many media companies are scanning the landscape and presuming that they have a glimpse of the future and yet they cannot distinguish between trendiness and actual trends. Too many media companies, for too long, have been guilty of the Abilene Paradox. Before I turn to the results in detail, I must mention once again our colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who continues to be unjustly detained in a Moscow prison. He has been incarcerated for almost a year solely for being a highly professional journalist. We, at News Corp, and of course, Evan's family and many friends, hope that justice will prevail and that he will be released immediately. I would like to personally thank all those who publicly and not so publicly have been working diligently to secure his emancipation. Turning now to Dow Jones, which yet again achieved its highest level of quarterly revenues and profitability since News Corp's acquisition. That result is thanks to solid performance across the business, most notably in the increasingly successful professional information business, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to profitability at Dow Jones this fiscal year. The Professional Information Business is seeing robust growth due to the integration of Opus, which was completed ahead of schedule, and CMA, which is near complete. I would like to compliment, in particular, the News Corp Finance team for masterminding executing and delivering the Opus and Base Chemicals deals, which have been so critical to Dow Jones burgeoning growth. Executives at Dow Jones are far from smug and are building a bevy of new and compelling products. For example, Opus' Analytics Pro utilizes our database of more than 130,000 fuel stations to track visits and help customers assess their pricing strategies and market trends as well as compile customer loyalty rates and demographics, among other valuable, actionable data points. Meanwhile, Risk and Compliance's financial instruments product in partnership with BigTXN provides a fleet of R&C-sanctioned profiles mapped to commonly used financial instruments, which is crucial compliance cartography in a heavily regulated world. And DJ Integrity Check, our partnership with [Sapien], provides generative AI-driven insight into companies and relevant potentially problematic individuals. Subscriptions at the news business are continuing to grow. And during the month of January, average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones portfolio, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and Investor's Business Daily, reached over 4.9 million, which represents more than double the pre-COVID average level of 2.4 million digital subscriptions in Q2 fiscal '20. The acceleration of digital subscription growth has been driven in part by the team's bundling of products, which is designed to increase reader engagement and reduce long-term churn. While we have purposely shifted emphasis to recurring revenues at Dow Jones, we are happy to report that although we faced some challenges in print advertising, digital advertising grew year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This positive result has been driven primarily by growth in the tech and automotive sectors and most notably at wsj.com. Digital Real Estate Services had a strong quarter, thanks largely to the prospering of REA, where there was 22% revenue growth year-over-year, fueled by an 8% increase in listings with heightened activity in the core Melbourne and Sydney markets and higher pricing. REA India continues to expand rapidly and reported over 19 million monthly average unique visitors in December, solidifying its lead as the foremost digital housing platform in the world's most populous country, where strong economic growth and political stability have created a platform for further expansion. At Move, realtor.com, continued to be affected by the high U.S. interest rates that have undermined activity in the market. But mortgage rates are beginning to moderate. And in recent weeks, there have been early signs of an increase in all important leads. The National Association of Realtors announced that the index for pending home sales increased just over 8% in December versus the prior year, the largest increase since June 2020. realtor.com's latest housing report revealed that January marked the third consecutive month of year-over-year inventory growth, with a 2.8% increase in newly listed homes for sale compared to January 2023. Unique users at REALTOR have also stabilized, with December comScore data signaling a return to growth. During the downturn, the realtor.com team has been assiduously improving the user experience, broadening the portfolio of products for our customers and bolstering the back-end technology, so we are poised to take full advantage of the incipient recovery in the U.S. housing market. HarperCollins had stellar results for the second successive quarter. This was thanks to strength in both the front list and the back list, notably in the blossoming audio books category. We saw 15% digital revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by a 29% audio books sales increase due to a flourishing market and our new partnership with Spotify. Spotify appears to be expanding demand for audio books and opening the category up to new consumers. I would like to commend our thoughtful partner, Daniel Ek, for his commitment to creativity. In Q2, we saw success with bestsellers like The Pioneer Woman Cooks—, Dinner's Ready! by Ree Drummond; The Little Liar by Mitch Albom; Ann Patchett's Tom Lake; and Barbara Kingsolver's Demon Copperhead. We also saw strong sales for Christian books, including The Great Disappearance by Dr. David Jeremiah, who is rapture ready, and The Bible itself. Looking ahead to Q3, we have great expectations for, among others, A.J. Finn's End of Story and I Am More Than by LeBron James. At Subscription Video Services, our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbl, is expected to launch next month and improve the search experience for our cherished customers seeking entertainment and sports. We believe Hubbl will be the most effective conduit between consumer and content and add to the Foxtel success story. In a volatile world, Foxtel has achieved 8 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in constant currency, while being acutely and astutely cost conscious in managing the transition to streaming. At Kayo, we are looking forward to the upcoming winter sports season for Australian rules football and Rugby League, the 2 dominant sports. And at Binge, there has been early success with advertising at the basic tier while continuing ad-free service for premium customers. In News Media, our news brands have seen improvement in traffic in recent weeks, a turnaround after convulsions in the first half, where there were algorithmic aberrations. Gratifyingly, we experienced digital subscription growth during the quarter. Rebekah Brooks and her team at News U.K., have overseen continuing progress at The Times and Sunday Times, which set a new record for the quarter in digital subscriptions, at 575,000, and saw significant digital ad growth, up 21% on a reported basis and over 15% in local currency. We expect the success of The Times to continue beyond Britain's borders with the imminent digital launch of The Times in the U.S. We are confident that it will resonate with discerning readers hungry for objective news coverage in a market saturated with narrative non-journalism. At News Corp Australia, news.com.au was again the country's leading news web with nearly 13 million monthly uniques in December according to metrics from Ipsos. And The New York Post is again on course to be profitable and has expanded its positive political influence in these vexed and vexing times. With the strong results in Q2 and Q1, we are off to a sterling start in fiscal year 2024, which follows the 3 most profitable years for the new News Corp. We can sense that investors are beginning to appreciate keenly the value of our brands and the potential of our portfolio. On behalf of all our investors, we have transformed free cash flow generation, bolstered our balance sheet, initiated a dividend and are continuing our $1 billion buyback plan. For that transformative success, I would like to pay tribute to the strategic support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and to our highly engaged directors and to the commitment of our employees around the world. I am now pleased to turn to my talented colleague, Susan Panuccio, who will elaborate on these bouyant results."", 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, resulting in first half year-over-year improvements in both profitability and revenues. We continue to transform the company and move towards higher recurring and digital revenues, together with exercising strong capital allocation discipline and balancing reinvestment across the portfolio with ongoing fixed cost reductions. Our second quarter total revenues were $2.6 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year, an increase from the 1% growth delivered in the first quarter. Adjusted revenues grew 2% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $473 million for the quarter, up 16% compared to the prior year, driven by strong performances across our 3 key growth pillars: Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, which all posted double-digit profit gains. In fact, in the aggregate, those key segments delivered 24% profitability growth this quarter. Our second quarter total segment EBITDA was also the highest in 2 years adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 14% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.26 in the quarter compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were for $419 million, up 9%, a notable improvement from the first quarter rate and a return to revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of financial year 2022. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues rose 8%. Segment EBITDA rose an impressive 15% to $147 million due to a higher contribution from the REA Group, partially offset by revenue headwinds at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 16%. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 22% year-on-year on a reported basis to a quarterly record of $292 million with minimal impact from foreign exchange. Growth was again primarily driven by residential yield increases, improved growth in national listings favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. Overall, new buy listings rose approximately 8%, with Melbourne up 24% and Sydney up 22%. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence directly after hours for more details. Move's revenues of $127 million were down 13% compared to the prior year, with declines moderating from recent quarters. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 14%, driven by lower lead and transaction volume, reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 7% year-over-year with December improving to down just 2%, benefiting from a combination of easier comparisons as well as recent declines in mortgage rates. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat compared to the prior year, at 66 million. The U.S. housing environment remains tough, with existing home sales hitting 30-year lows, although we are hopeful the market will start to show improvement in the second half given recent declines in mortgage rates. That said, irrespective of any market considerations, we are determined to strengthen realtor.com's product and content offering so it's best positioned for success when the housing market moves. To that end, the realtor.com team is focused on executing several key strategic priorities, which include modernizing the technology platform to help with unifying the customer experience across all platforms; creating unique and scaled data for proprietary content to assist with increased personalization; leveraging News Corp's network in relation to AI initiatives and capturing audience share; and accelerating the diversification of revenues with a greater focus on the sell-side offering. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $470 million, up 2% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.3 million a quarter and flat with the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 2.8 million, increasing 4% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially due to seasonality at Kayo, tougher financial conditions caused by the inflationary environment for consumers and a weaker sports cycle. Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, dowant to 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was flat at 12.9% despite the final migration of cable in October. While broadcast ARPU rose 3% to approximately AUD 86, helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $77 million was down 14% versus the prior year, driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements and $10 million related to the upcoming launch of Hubbl, partially offset by higher revenues and lower technology and marketing costs. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. Moving on to Dow Jones. As Robert mentioned, the second quarter results delivered the highest quarterly revenue and segment EBITDA performance since the acquisition of Dow Jones over 15 years ago. Dow Jones delivered revenues of $584 million, up 4% year-over-year, which made Dow Jones the highest segment revenue contributor for the quarter for the first time since it was resegmented. Digital revenues accounted for 78% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented almost 76% of total revenues, up approximately 2 percentage points from the prior year, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We had very strong growth at PIB with revenues rising 13% year-over-year, including 16% growth at Risk and Compliance to $72 million and 15% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $62 million. Factiva again posted growth, benefiting from a new licensing deal. Total [pretension] rates remain very strong at over 90%. We are continuing to review our disclosures with the primary focus on increasing transparency to help the market appropriately value Dow Jones. To that end, we are now providing revenues for both Risk and Compliance and Dow Jones Energy in the 10-Q. Within the Dow Jones consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 15% year-over-year or by 135,000 sequentially, driven by an increased focus on the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlapping between products and drive greater engagement. Bundling accounted for over 70% of the incremental digital-only volume growth in quarter 2. Advertising revenues declined 4% to $126 million, relatively stable with the first quarter rate, although digital returned to year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the first quarter of financial year '23, rising 1%, driven by strength in the technology and auto categories. Print declined 11% due to weaknesses in financial services. Digital represented 62% of advertising revenues, up 59% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 17% to $163 million and was the largest segment EBITDA contributor with margins improving 320 basis points to 27.9%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. Cost declined about 1%, driven by head count reductions and lower newsprint production and distribution costs, in addition to phasing of sales and marketing miniature. At Book Publishing, financial performance, again, meaningfully exceeded our expectations, particularly in profitability. Revenues were $550 million, up 4%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $85 million compared to the prior year. Margins increased by almost 600 basis points to 15.5%. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key front-list titles, as Robert mentioned, and saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian publishing. Churn rates again improved materially due to better sell-through compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. Inflationary costs moderated with lower manufacturing costs, helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 60% of revenues, up from 57% last year, while digital sales rose 15% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio accounted for nearly 50% of digital sales, a record high, and we are pleased with the early positive signs from our partnership with Spotify, which generated incremental digital revenues and EBITDA this quarter. As way of background, Spotify is a usage-based model, not a pooled model. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 2% and segment EBITDA rose 65%. Turning to News Media. Performance in this segment was more challenged. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 5%. Advertising declined 9% and were down 11% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 5% and was up 2% in constant currency, benefiting from cover price increases. Advertising remained particularly challenged, with digital advertising trends again negatively impacted by the lower traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms. That said, as Robert noted, encouraging me, we are seeing some recovery in recent weeks, particularly at The Sun in the U.S. Segment EBITDA of $52 million, declined $7 million, which was due to the lower revenue, partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint and lower spend at talkTV. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 15%. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short term, albeit economic conditions vary across markets. Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January grew 12%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we hope to see continued improvements in lead volumes, with January up 1% year-over-year, given recent declines in borrowing costs, albeit off low prior year comparisons. As we mentioned last quarter, we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing and product development in the second half, increasing from depressed levels last year, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere. In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year, ongoing inflationary pressures, fewer new releases across entertainment due to the writers and actors' strike and a weaker summer sports schedule has created softness in streaming revenues, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. At Dow Jones, we expect strong revenue and profitability performance, underpinned by the transformation of our B2B offerings, and as mentioned previously, continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year. At Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends remain relatively stable, and we are encouraged by the strength in the downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year. At News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. Finally, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, we do expect some negative translation in the third quarter. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.', 'David Karnovsky', 'I guess the AI topic, Robert, you noted in the release you expect to be a core content provider for gen AI companies. Maybe you can speak a bit to current negotiations. What are the key sticking points key priorities for you or even the red lines for News Corp as you engage on this?', 'Robert J. Thomson', ""Yes, David, obviously, there's confidential negotiations, and so I can't go into too much detail. I mean it is fair to say that we've been leading the intellectual debate among media companies on AI. And it's also fair to say that we're probably leading the commercial discussions. I mean, 17 years ago, when prestige-craving media executives were sashaying with Silicon Valley, we were raising down stats about providence but also about the [valuable] impact on vulnerable young people of the smartest engineers on the planet creating compulsive-addictive experiences. Anyway, we're certainly not naive as well about the potentially positive and negative impacts of AI on our journalism, our creativity, our content. We've had almost 2 decades of distribution, dominating creation and almost 60%-or-so journalists have lost jobs in the U.S. And candidly, unfortunately, a certain percentage of that is down to journalistic pomposity and price consciousness, not audience consciousness and relevance consciousness. But AI is a hyper-effective form of -- or gen AI is a hyper-effective form of derivative distribution. It's retrospective, not prospective. And the thoughtful AI companies understand that fact. And so that's why on this occasion, I would like to highlight the thoughtfulness of Sam Altman. Thoughtful people do understand that counterfeiting is not creating. And crucially, in this exceedingly erratic era, we have deep facts, not deep fakes."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from [Anja Rakowski] from Evans & Partners.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Robert, maybe if I can pick up on the generative AI question as well. I appreciate there's only so much you can say, but how do you think about the potential payments which could come for the value of your content relative to what you're currently receiving from the digital platforms? Is it a similar sort of quantum? Could it be even a greater quantum over time, at least on a relative basis, I'd be interested in how you're thinking about it. And longer term, do you expect that those payments from the digital platforms will continue to come through?"", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""And so I'm sorry to be a basic, but I simply can't comment on the content and the negotiations. But I can't say they're at an advanced stage, and we are dealing with willing partners."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.', 'Kane Hannan', 'Maybe just on Dow Jones. I think the costs were down about $3 million in the quarter. Can you just talk a bit more about the [downtown] cost base, whether we can extrapolate that sort of performance going forward? And maybe as a follow-on to that, just the Professional Information Services within Dow Jones. I mean, obviously, extra disclosure. Did that business see margin expansion in the quarter? Or is the strong margin expansion, the Dow Jones overall, more of a mix and cost out in the other businesses?', 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""Hi, Kane, welcome back. Look, just in relation to the costs, we did see a pretty good cost performance for the first half at Dow Jones. And I think like all our businesses, they are pretty cost focused. So they do constantly have a look at transformation opportunities within the business, and they certainly participated in the 5% headcount reduction, and they're getting the benefit of that. But like all the businesses, we do like to invest in them. So we do see variable costs going up as the revenue scales. They have had inflationary costs in relation to headcount, and we'll continue to invest in headcount given the growth in that business. In the second half of the year, we would expect to see some phasing and additional costs coming through from marketing. We do tend to have seasonally higher net adds in the second half than we do in the first half. And so that typically warrants some additional marketing costs. So that's sort of in relation to the cost base. And then in relation to PIB, we don't give out the margins, as you know, but the PIB margins did improve for the quarter, which was really pleasing to see as they continue to scale that business. And as we said in our prepared remarks, for the full year, we're continuing to expect to see the majority of the profit come from the PIB segment."", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""Yes. And just to supplement Susan's answer, obviously, there was a priority for Dow Jones and for News Corp. And we are providing more visibility overall, Jones because it's such a positive story. And frankly, the more you see, the more you like. I mean overall, the margin at Dow Jones has risen from 24.7% a year ago to 27.9% and now that we're lapping the purchases of Opus and CMA, the strong growth rates are clear at these companies, which we have grouped into Dow Jones Energy, where revenues expanded by 15% and it is also, though, worth noting the result of the always burgeoning Risk and Compliance segment where revenues rose 16%. In short, these high-margin recurring businesses providing essential services and thus have renewal rates well north of 90%."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.', 'Craig Anthony Huber', ""Great. I wanted to ask, on the portfolio review and simplification announced that you mentioned 3 months ago and you briefly touched on it today. Can you just give us a further update. I'm just curious on the timing of this. I mean, I personally didn't expect a major announcement within just the first 3 months, but also the flip side, when it is expected to take another 6-plus months from this stage going forward? Do you just give us a little sense of the timing there? I mean, I assume you guys did an awful lot of work behind the scenes before you even talked about it 3 months ago in your conference call. You've certainly done some -- I'm sure some of these last 3 months. Just give us a little bit sense of the timing when we might get an announcement here, please?"", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""Craig, your presumption about preparation is not your conceived, but this being a rather sophisticated audience one which understands the nuances of phrases and the subtleties of the SEC. You can take the words I used in my statement as purposefully delivered. There is clearly much introspection, not casual, not peripheral. But significant serious introspection about structure, and it's functional, not emotional. And the prevailing truth is that we have created options for our shareholders, and that's a tribute to all at News Corp with the active support of enlighten Board and leadership from Rupert and Lachlan and the efforts of our employees around the world. Let us not forget that (inaudible) investment bankers were decidedly down beat at the time of the split a decade ago. And now, however, the discussion is how to get full value from, how to fully monetize a precious prestigious portfolio that has an obvious growth trajectory. That is indeed not an evolution, but a revolution."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.', 'Lucy Huang', ""Robert, Susan. My question is on PIB as well. Given we're kind of getting through the end of the [interaction of a person] CMA. Just wondering strategically how you're thinking about the growth in the business? And are there any other data sets that you would be looking to maybe build-out acquire over time? Like are there intentions or, I guess, capabilities you'll like to plug with PIB?"", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""Listen, obviously, we're pleased with the progress of the PIB business. And as I said, you can see the overall increase in margin at Dow Jones, and that is to a large extent due to the success of the big businesses. I can't get into any more details about what our plans are. But needless to say, PIB is core to Dow Jones and its quarter News Corp."", 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""And Lucy, what I say is that the thing that's great about PIB and the energy businesses is that the new products can leverage the existing data sets that we have, so the pricing, reporting analytics and newsletters and they can draw off a lot of the core data that we have. So I think that's fantastic. And I think Robert's mentioned in previous quarters, we've got areas like renewables that are coming in that we really think that could provide an exciting opportunity for us."", 'Michael Florin', 'Thank you, Lucy.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.', 'Brian Han', 'Susan, I noticed the second quarter PCP growth in books EBITDA is exactly the same as the first quarter PCP growth, both exactly, I think, 2/3 up on prior period. Is there some sort of a contracted step-up in earnings for books? Or is that just pure coincidence?', 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""I'd like to think they would be at that level, but no. No, I think it's just a coincidence. Look, we -- as we sort of said in the remarks, the Book Publishing segment has continued to exceed our expectations. And look, it's partly because we've had a return to more stability in the revenue post-COVID. So the returns have settled down and the market has settled down a little bit. And it's also partly because of the great work that the HarperCollins team has done in relation to their cost base. I mean in the face of some pretty challenging conditions last year, they also took the opportunity to push through some price rises on books. So a combination of all of that has really helped with putting the good results in for the first half. Look, I think across the full year, we're still expecting margins to be sort of in the low double digits, a good improvement from the prior year, but probably not to the levels that we've seen in the first half."", 'Michael Florin', 'Thank you, Brian.

Can you give us a feel as to how much has been completed so far this fiscal year of the previous $160 million number. And just a feel for -- do you expect more of it to be [weighted] in third quarter or fourth quarter? Maybe another way to answer the question is what the [Dow Jones] should we expect to see a lot of this cost out come from, please?', 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""Yes. Look, it's pleasing to say that actually, we quoted, I think, Dow Jones' number in relation to that cost-out program, and we are going to exceed that number. And actually, from a run rate perspective, we're pretty much there already. We have said in previous statements though, that's the gross cost savings, and we do have reinvestments across our businesses, as you can see within Dow Jones, within our REA, [Legacy News] with the Hubbl launch. And so that is the gross cost savings. What I would say is, notwithstanding that we are always looking at cost savings across our businesses. And so that was pertaining just to headcount reductions. We're constantly looking at our cost base and workflows and our efficiencies, and we do continue to drive great savings on that, which helps us reinvest in these businesses."", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""And Darren, I'd just like to supplement Susan's point, we are not going to let these excellent results in any way, induce complacency in the company. All the teams are extremely cost conscious. And we're already seeing very interesting trends in the ability of AI to risk costs related to technology spend to the creation of code to the cultivation of code. And so not only are we going to be pursuing our conventional costs, but we're looking ahead and trying to make the most of new developments."", 'Michael Florin', ""Thank you. Darren. We'll take our next question, please."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions). At this time, we have no further questions. I'll now hand over to Michael Florin for closing remarks."", 'Michael Florin', 'Well, thank you, Leila, and thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we will talk to you soon.

Fewer surveyed independent landlords are planning to raise rents this year, but with more tenants paying persistently higher rents in recent years, many renters say it's likely to impact their home purchase plans this year."", '""The once-hot rental market has been stabilizing and softening year-over-year since May 2023, mostly from a surge in new rental options coming to the market that gave renters more to choose from. But the surge in rents and the sheer number of renters, many of whom have held off on buying in recent years, continue to minimize any potential price impacts that increased rental inventory could have on the market,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com®. ""The median asking rent in 2024 is expected to drop only slightly below its 2023 level (-0.2%), but with wages rising 4.5% in January and anticipated to continue growing, even the modest decline in rent is giving households a real break, reducing the share of each paycheck going toward rent.""', ""Fewer landlords raising rents this yearAccording to the survey, while six in 10 landlords (60%) plan to raise rent in the next 12 months, that percentage declined in recent quarters, down from 65% in Q1 2023. The majority of surveyed landlords (69%) noted they raise rent differently for renewals versus new leases, with the most opting for 0-5% increases for renewals and 0-10% increases for new leases. Among landlords who don't raise rents differently for renewal versus new tenants, the majority (50%) plan to increase rent between 0-5%."", 'Planned rent increases are inline with higher costs across the board for many Americans, including landlords who are passing those costs on to their tenants. The majority of landlords (60%) stated that their ownership costs increased upwards of 10% in the past 12 months. Among landlords not planning to raise rents this year, 72% cite their unit already being priced at or above local market value.', ""Persistently high prices squeeze rentersThe average responding renter pays between $1,000 and $1,500 monthly, but the survey found more renters are paying rents upwards of $1000–$2000 than in previous surveys, indicating continued rent increases for many across the country. In fact, 71% of surveyed renters noted a rent increase when renewing their most recent lease. And relief from high housing costs isn't in sight, with 35% of surveyed renters anticipating future rent increases and 38% unsure if they will see one, leading nearly two thirds (63%) to explore other housing options besides renewing their current lease. Common reasons for those not renewing leases included that the current rent was too expensive (43%) and unaffordable rent increases (23%)."", 'For some, staying put when a lease is up and negotiating rent increases may help save money; the percentage of renters attempting to negotiate rent increases when renewing their lease increased from 28% in Q1 2023 to 34% in Q4 2023. This may be especially true in 2024 as higher rental vacancy rates may mean landlords are more interested in securing renewals.', 'Budget constraints put home buying plans on pauseRising interest rates and inflation are impacting home purchasing plans for many renters looking at buying in the year ahead, with 82% of surveyed renters noting the economy has had an impact on their housing plans. Among renters who are not considering a home purchase this year (71%), the majority cited not having enough for a down payment (61%) and that interest rates are too high (42%).', ""The proportion of renters considering purchasing a home in the next 12 months decreased slightly from 30% in Q1 2023 to 29% in Q4 2023, with concerns about a lack of savings and their ability to qualify for a mortgage increasing. That's not surprising, given that two thirds of renters (68%) reported saving less each month than they were 12 months ago."", ""Rental owners staying put on their properties\xa0Higher home prices and mortgage rates are also impacting landlords' plans for investing in more rental properties in the year ahead. Only 22% of surveyed landlords reported plans to buy one or more rental properties in the next 12 months, not unexpected given that approximately 7 in 10 surveyed landlords already have a mortgage on at least one rental property, and would likely finance another purchase with a mortgage. The majority of landlords have no plans to exit the market either: 73% stated they don't plan to sell any units in their portfolio over the next 12 months."", ""MethodologyAvail's quarterly survey of landlords and renters was conducted online in the U.S. between Dec. 6-15, 2023.

But I went back to Meta's IPO to measure this and if you look at the divergence, the average range between the best performing and the worst performing name out of the Magnificent Seven, there are some years where it's over-- on a rolling 12 month basis-- over 1,000%."", ""Now some of that is Tesla's outsized gains.

Small and medium-sized enterprises are increasingly adopting this technology to improve customer experiences and stay competitive in the market. Industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, retail, gaming, education, and automotive are actively embracing AR for training, maintenance, assistance, and monitoring purposes. The augmented reality market is expected to grow due to increased smartphone adoption and app integration, according to Fortune Business Insights. Moreover, key market players collaborating with 5G providers to address latency issues are anticipated to drive market growth. For example, in May 2022, Telstra Group Limited (ASX:TLS), an Australian telecommunications company, partnered with Google and Accenture to create a 5G-powered augmented reality experience at Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium. Such collaborations among major tech providers are likely to enhance the potential of AR in diverse innovative and immersive applications.', 'The AR market was valued at $42.20 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach $1.11 trillion by 2030, exhibiting a 50.7% compound annual growth rate. In 2022, the North American augmented reality market was valued at $13.72 billion. Key industry players like PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) offer different AR solutions. For instance, PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) provides products like Vuforia AR, Vuforia Studio, Vuforia Expert Capture, Vuforia Instruct, and Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, while Google LLC offers ARCore, an AR platform featuring cloud anchors, environmental HDR, and depth for digital objects.', ""In 2023, we witnessed the launch of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro, alongside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s premium VR device, targeted either as a creative tool or a luxury item due to its high price. This year might unveil Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s anticipated AR glasses. Different devices, like the Apple Glasses and Meta Quest Pro, will strive to offer unique experiences. Some will emphasize a sophisticated high-end encounter, while others will prioritize lightweight and simplicity, understanding that current headset sizes and weights deter adoption for many users. Online platforms enabling remote teamwork will evolve in 2024, aiming for increased immersion and practicality. Despite the popularity of remote work, certain aspects of in-person communication are challenging to replicate. Collaborative mixed reality tools are expected to utilize VR and AR more extensively, capturing and expressing the subtle nuances of interaction that are difficult to convey through video calls."", 'Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Tim Cook unveiled the ""Vision Pro,"" an augmented reality headset, during the WWDC event in June 2023. According to Cook, it represents a new kind of computer that enhances user experience through the most natural and intuitive methods. He likened its significance to the introduction of previous Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, suggesting that just as the Mac brought personal computing and the iPhone brought mobile computing, the Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing. The Vision Pro marks Apple\'s entry into a significant new product category, the first since 2015. Priced at $3,499, this headset seamlessly combines virtual and augmented reality. Historically, this market has been somewhat specialized, with Meta holding a dominant position. However, Apple aims to leverage advanced technology and its renowned marketing skills to elevate this sector. During the launch event at Apple\'s New York store, CEO Tim Cook highlighted the device\'s impressive interface, describing it as a ""magical way to control"" the headset. The Vision Pro utilizes eye movement and hand gestures for navigation, offering users immersive experiences. Cook draws parallels between the Vision Pro\'s debut and the launches of other iconic Apple devices, such as the Mac, iPod, and iPhone, emphasizing that it now stands among the groundbreaking products in Apple\'s history.', 'New entrants are creating a buzz in the augmented reality space. For example, Xreal, a maker of augmented reality glasses, is in the process of raising $60 million in funding, bringing its total funding to over $300 million and valuing the company at more than $1 billion. The CEO, Chi Xu, aims to stay ahead of competitors like Apple, Meta Platforms, and Google in the augmented reality space. Xreal, a Chinese startup, holds approximately 4% of the overall mixed reality market, with a significant presence in the AR-only devices sector. The funds will support the production of 2 million devices next year, with a target of going public in the United States within the next two years.

Instead of portraying himself as a fiery nationalist, as he did in two prior failed presidential bids, the 72-year-old\'s new catchphrase is ""gemoy"" - which is Indonesian slang for cute and cuddly.

What likely caught Wall Street's attention though was that the company amended its capital return program alongside its blowout fourth-quarter earnings release to add $50 billion to its share repurchase authorization."", ""With the share price climbing as high as $485 the day after it reported earnings, the annual dividend yield amounts to a paltry 0.41%. That's not going to get most dividend investors very excited about buying shares in the big tech company."", ""But dividend investors shouldn't overlook Meta's decision to initiate a dividend just because the yield is extremely low. In fact, the dividend may be one of the most important things to come out of Meta's earnings report for long-term investors."", 'Meta has had a generous capital return program for several years. It started with a modest share repurchase authorization in 2017, but quickly ramped up the buybacks. Over the past three years, management has bought back $92.3 billion of its stock.', ""The new share repurchase authorization adds another $50 billion in potential buybacks on top of the existing $31 billion under its pre-existing authorization. That's a lot of money, even for a company that's worth $1.2 trillion."", ""While share repurchases are a great way for management to return capital to shareholders, there's no requirement for management to use even one penny of retained earnings to buy back stock. On the other hand, a dividend is a much stronger commitment. With the dividend, the board is saying it'll return cash to shareholders every quarter. It's starting with dividend payments amounting to about $5 billion annually."", ""What's more, dividends are sticky. Most companies don't declare dividends for just a quarter or a year. They start paying a dividend with the intent of paying it for years to come. What's more, most expect to pay more cash to shareholders every year."", ""That's a sign of confidence from management that it'll produce consistently strong and growing cash flow and earnings for years to come to support a dividend."", ""Some investors won't buy a stock unless it pays a dividend. Now that Meta's joined the fray, even if it yields just 0.4%, it could attract the eyes of a whole new subset of investors."", ""Importantly, the dividend could provide a floor for the stock, as long as investors can reasonably expect Meta to meet its commitment to the quarterly payments. If the stock price drops, the yield will increase to the point of becoming attractive to some dividend investors. With the strong prospects for dividend growth from Meta, it won't take a very high current yield for it to be an attractive dividend investment."", ""What's more, Meta now qualifies for inclusion in a whole new set of index funds and ETFs. Those focusing on dividend growth, in particular, may soon find themselves owning a small piece of Meta."", ""Meta's dividend strikes similarities to the two biggest companies in the world: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)."", ""All three are tech giants, which aren't historically big dividend payers. But both Microsoft and Apple have consistently increased their dividends while reinvesting plenty of money into the businesses to grow faster and faster every year."", ""When Microsoft declared its first dividend in 2003, it paid shareholders an annual payment of $0.08 per share. That translated to a yield of about 0.3% at the time. Nonetheless, Microsoft's produced market-beating returns over the last 20 years while returning tons of cash to shareholders. It now pays $3 per year."", 'Likewise, Apple reinitiated its dividend in 2012, paying shareholders $2.65 per quarter. That worked out to a fairly attractive yield of 1.8% at the time. But similar to Microsoft, Apple has been able to consistently raise its dividend every year while growing the business. As a result, shares have increased more than eightfold since it first declared its dividend, not to mention that the quarterly dividend payment has increased by 2.5 times.', ""It may be tough to see how Meta grows its stock price as much as Apple or Microsoft have since they each initiated their dividends. After all, it's already a $1.2 trillion business. But for a little bit of perspective, Microsoft and Apple were already the largest publicly traded companies by market capitalization in the years they initiated their dividends."", 'At the very least, investors can expect consistent capital returns from the dividend, which should support the stock price and provide confidence to investors that management sees a lot more cash flow and earnings in the future.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

While the utility has some concerns about the timeline, it said in a Jan. 25 filing that aspects of the VPP could be included in an upcoming request for proposals in the first quarter.', 'Commissioner Tom Plant is pressing for Xcel to develop a VPP as part of an exploration of how third-party services can improve grid reliability.\xa0In a Jan. 5 recommended order,\xa0he sketched out how the VPP pilot might move ahead.', '“Exploration of private sector VPP concepts is becoming increasingly important as Colorado moves from a traditional baseload, intermediate and peaker resource model to one in which greater percentages, and ultimately nearly 100 percent of generation capacity will be intermittent,” according to the recommended order. “The ability to dynamically manage demand and supply will become increasingly more critical to cost effective operation of the grid.”', 'Development of the VPP pilot will require Xcel to issue a request for proposals for a Distributed Energy Management System, or DERMs, which the recommended order calls “the functional nervous system of a VPP.” That RFP is expected in the first quarter of this year. Though the utility indicated it had some technical and timing concerns, Xcel said it generally supported Plant’s proposed decision.', 'Under Plant’s proposed VPP schedule, enrollment of initial aggregators and participants would begin in July, the pilot would launch in October and Xcel would produce recommendations for a fully-scaled program by November 2026.', '“The company does not take specific exception to the timeline proposed for a VPP pilot expectation for third-party providers but notes that such a timeline is likely unachievable to efficiently and effectively implement a DERMS,” Xcel replied. Implementation “will require substantially more time,” potentially 18 months, the company said.', 'The use of a third-party DERMS provider will allow Xcel to move swiftly, other stakeholders said.', '“We do think that they can do more,\xa0sooner, and that a viable VPP program could be set up this year — certainly by this fall,” Brian Turner, director of policy in the Western states for Advanced Energy United, told Utility Dive. AEU, along with the Colorado Solar and Storage Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association, also filed recommended changes to Plant’s order\xa0though the groups broadly support the effort.', 'Plant’s order contemplates the VPP pilot testing a “prosumer tariff” for consumers that meet a “certain capacity level of available dispatch.”', '“Prosumer tariffs should be designed to be attractive financially to the participant such that the option to qualify for the tariff would be an incentive for the participant to invest in more DERs that would advance electrification and provide reliability services to the grid,” according to Plant’s recommended order.\xa0“These would be residential, commercial, and industrial customers with relative capacity levels that they can deliver to the grid.”', 'Opting in to the prosumer tariff would give the participant a rate that would have a higher fixed cost combined with a lower volumetric rate, according to the recommended order.', 'Likely participants include homes with one or more of batteries, electric vehicle chargers, hot water heaters and smart thermostats, said Turner. Xcel already uses two third party vendors,\xa0Tesla\xa0and SolarEdge, which provide equipment within the utility’s existing Renewable Battery Connect Program,\xa0he said.\xa0That program allows Xcel to control customers’ solar-charged batteries during peak periods, but it requires the utility to request dispatch from the third-party.', '“That same model could work in the near term,” Turner said. Xcel, however, has said that the utility ultimately wants a DERMS platform than can engage with multiple vendors’ equipment at once.', 'The VPP pilot will eventually be broken out of the current miscellaneous docket exploring third-party provision of services. It could be included in either Xcel’s Distributed Resources Planning proceeding or in an upcoming Demand-Side Management/Beneficial Electrification proceeding.', 'Turner said he expects a revised recommended decision to come soon from the PUC.', '“We know that all the parties would like to move fast on the composite parts,” he said. With Xcel looking to issue an RFP this quarter, “they need to get the direction from the commission on what that looks like. And this proceeding is meant to shape what that looks like. So we should see some direction out of the commission soon.”', 'This story was originally published on Utility Dive.

98,6aa015e6-f34f-318e-85bd-701b181113a4,ADM,2024-02-08,15 Biggest Agriculture Stocks in 2024,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-agriculture-stocks-2024-203701833.html,1707338221,STORY,"['CTVA', 'DE', 'ADM', 'MOS', 'BG']","['In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest agriculture stocks in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of the agriculture industry and what can be classified as an agriculture stock, then you can take a look at the 5 Biggest Agriculture Stocks in 2024. ', ""Despite having been replaced by industrialization, services, and now information technology, agriculture is nevertheless indispensable when it comes to maintaining and growing modern day societies. At the same time, since it's the one industry that has accompanied modern day civilization since its start, agriculture has also evolved with the ages. Now, companies that we can characterize as agriculture stocks no longer need to be involved either directly in the process of farming, in the process of storing food, or even in providing products such as pesticides and fertilizers to make a farmer's life easier."", 'Instead, agriculture stocks such as the industrial behemoth Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) are manufacturing firms that make complex equipment capable of carrying out the tasks of hundreds of workers at a lower cost. Machines such as the ones made by Deere have transformed the way human beings have been able to grow, matching the impact by pureplay agriculture stocks such as Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. (NASDAQ:PACB) and Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA).', ""In fact, technologies that agriculture stocks such as Pacific Biosciences rely on would be classified as nothing short of science fiction at the very least or even magic by farmers of previous centuries. PacBio sells systems that enable scientists and researchers to sequence the code of biological organisms. So, while farmers of 1900 would have to contend with seeing their crops die in the face of disease, today's farmers can rely on crops that have been genetically engineered to be resistant to the same attackers. Similarly, ranchers or cattle farmers can rely on livestock capable of meeting modern day production needs of both milk and meat."", 'All these factors combined mean that agriculture stocks are quite lucrative. While they might not be as glitzy as high end artificial intelligence firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), agriculture stocks provide investors with the comfort of knowing that the demand for their products will continue as long as humans rely on biological food for sustenance. This makes the stocks attractive during periods of economic downturn, like their counterparts in the consumer defensive stock sector.', 'At the same time, agriculture stocks are nevertheless vulnerable to the same market weaknesses as other stocks. Like broader commodity prices, agriculture stocks also rely on global supply chain stability to act as the backbone of their valuation. For instance, companies like Corteva that sell seeds might have a large portion of their customers located in an international country. If the shipping lines to that country are threatened, or if domestic conditions make spending money difficult for locals, then Corteva might see its investors become worried - causing the share price to drop.', ""Broadly speaking, we can break down agriculture stocks into several categories depending on the supply chain. At the backend of the chain, or upstream as analysts would like to call it, are seed, fertilizer, and medicine companies such as Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), Corteva, and the well known Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (OTC:BAYRY). Then, after the farmers have grown the crops, firms such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) pop in and buy their products to act as a middle party between the farmer and the market. Agriculture stocks such as Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) procure products such as potatoes and sell them in the form of finished products such as fries further down the supply chain. From here on, agriculture stocks see the end of the road as retailers like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) deliver the product in the consumer's hands."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest agriculture stocks as we head into 2024.

Since 2008, PMI has invested $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products. As of December 31, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 84 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 20.8 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 37% of PMI’s total full-year 2023 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

While amortization expense on acquisition related intangible assets is excluded in these adjusted measures, the net revenues generated from these acquired intangible assets are included in the company\'s adjusted measures, unless otherwise stated. Currency-neutral and organic growth rates reflect the way management views underlying performance for these measures. PMI believes that such measures provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results. Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI’s business performance between reporting periods.

We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release attached to our Form 8-K as well as on our website, westernunion.com, under the Investor Relations section. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Devin McGranahan.', ""Devin McGranahan: Good afternoon and welcome to Western Union's fourth quarter 2023 financial results conference call. Now two years into my tenure as CEO, I am pleased with the improvements we are seeing in our trajectory under our Evolve 2025 strategy. As you know, over the last 18 months, we have focused on returning our digital business to double-digit revenue growth and achieving stability in our retail business. The fourth quarter is further evidence that we are indeed on the right path. Today, we are reporting a strong finish to the year with positive adjusted revenue growth and improved transaction trends across both our retail and digital businesses with transaction growth north of 5% for the second consecutive quarter."", 'Consistent and sustainable transaction growth is the strongest indicator of the future health of our business. It has been nearly a decade since the company has delivered 5% plus transaction growth for multiple quarters in a row excluding the COVID recovery period. We are pleased with this significant change in our trajectory. Digging in, looking at a quarter level trends, you can see the change in trajectory is both widespread and meaningful, whether looking at the U.S. to Mexico, France to Africa or the world to the Philippines, these corridors show the same picture, considerable improvements in transaction growth rates over the last 18 months. As this graph illustrates, our work over the last 18 months to improve our customer experience, streamline our operational processes and accelerate our market effectiveness is driving significantly improved outcomes.', 'Our confidence in achieving sustainable, profitable revenue growth by 2025 increases each quarter as we stabilize our retail business, accelerate our digital business expand our ecosystem offerings, enhance our customer and agent experiences and maintain industry-leading margins like we did this past quarter. For the fourth quarter, our revenue reached $1.050 billion [ph], reflecting a 3% increase on a constant currency basis when excluding the contribution from Business Solutions compared to the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share came in strong at $0.37, up 16% on a year-over-year basis and allowed us to achieve the upper end of our EPS guidance. Maintaining our long history of returning capital to shareholders, we produced another year of solid cash flow with operating cash flow of $800 million of which $650 million was returned to our shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks.', 'As we discussed at our Investor Day in 2022, to date, we have funded all the required investments in our transformation while maintaining our 19% to 21% adjusted margins and continuing strong returns of capital to our investors. Matt will further discuss our financial results in more detail and provide our 2024 outlook later in this call. In addition to improving financial results, we continue to execute well on our strategic priorities. Over the last year, we have made meaningful progress on our most important initiatives, including improving our retail operations, updating our digital platforms and go-to-market strategy, refining our customer and agent experiences and enhancing our overall value proposition in the marketplace. While our journey is not over, I would like to share some of the highlights from this past year.', 'Starting with our retail business. In 2023, we made material enhancements to our point-of-sale system with new functionalities like remember me, quick resend, debit payment enablement, digital receipts and enhanced payout to account capabilities. These improvements, while not ground-breaking, have made our retail customer and agent experience more competitive and have contributed significantly to the improvements you see in our retail transaction trends over the last 18 months. Additionally, we will continue to roll out these functionalities across the globe and anticipate further benefits in 2024. In addition to our point-of-sale improvements, we also made significant progress on expanding our controlled distribution strategy which includes both owned and concept stores in LACA, Europe, the Middle East and APAC.', 'Recall that by enabling an exclusive Western Union experience in high-impact locations, we believe we have more control over the customer experience can test new products and services and creates a new low-cost acquisition engine for our digital business. This strategy which prior to 2023, was largely a Latin American phenomena with owned networks in both Argentina and Brazil has now been expanded to every region in the company. In 2023, we opened 100 new owned locations in 200 new concept stores which increased our controlled distribution strategy by over 35%. In addition to new store openings, we also updated roughly 30,000 high-impact retail locations around the world with our new Western Union brand format presenting a more contemporary and omni-channel message to our retail customers.', 'To complement our controlled distribution strategy, last year, we also enhanced our digital capabilities, including launching our next-generation digital app now in 12 countries around the globe, launching a digital wallet in four European and one Latin American country and implementing a new digital go-to-market strategy. This strategy has allowed us to drive more traffic to our digital platforms, increase our conversion rates, improve our marketing messages and enhance our value proposition while materially lowering our customer acquisition costs. As evidence of this, in 2023, we were able to grow new digital customers double digits while at the same time, lowering our customer acquisition costs by over 15%. The scalable, cost-effective new customer acquisition is the foundation for continued double-digit growth of new digital transactions.', 'Given the journey we are on, ongoing operational performance improvement is a powerful driver of agent and customer satisfaction and ultimately will lead to improved retention. Last year, we made significant changes across key elements of our customer and agent experiences. These changes resulted in millions of fewer phone calls to our call center and improvements in both agent and customer satisfaction. For example, we improved self-service tools like our Track a Transfer to integrate across channels so that customers can get status updates on their transfer through the Western Union mobile app, regardless of whether that transfer was initiated on the app or at more than over 400,000 retail active locations around the world. As you will recall, in late 2022, we started rolling out our new digital go-to-market strategy.', 'This strategy included revised marketing, a focus on funnel effectiveness, improved onboarding processes, promotional pricing for new customers and market-based pricing on subsequent transactions. The program has led to double-digit new customer growth and double-digit transaction growth throughout 2023. By the end of the first quarter of 2024, we will anniversary in [ph] both, the U.S. and the European launches of this strategy and as such, we expect the gap between transaction growth rates and revenue growth rates to continue to narrow throughout the year. Likewise, on the retail side, last year, we also began rolling out a new go-to-market program to complement our focus on location productivity. That program included revised marketing seasonal and holiday promotions and some corridor and geographic-specific pricing initiatives.', 'The majority of these actions occurred in the second and third quarters of last year and we are now holistically happy with the results that they are producing. We believe these changes have helped us deliver positive retail transaction growth for the first time in many years and has reinforced our belief that we can achieve a stable retail business in the near future. One of the regions that have benefited immensely from these changes implemented over the last year is our APAC region, a region that has been in cyclical decline for over five years. APAC was early in the launch of our next-generation digital app and they have been advancing our efforts through controlled distribution. This region now has some of the highest digital new customer growth rates, the highest digital conversion rates and has the most significant change in transaction growth rates we have seen anywhere in the world, led by Australia.', 'Transaction growth rates in APAC have improved 1,000 basis points or more year-over-year in every quarter of 2023. This type of improvement, you can see, when you have the right technology, the right distribution strategy and great customer and agent experience. We believe the right user interface and a keen focus on funnel management will help us meet our expectations of returning our digital business to double-digit revenue growth. Looking ahead, while there is more work to be done and the team is committed to the ongoing continuous improvement of our core remittance business, we are also working diligently to expand our total addressable market beyond cross-border remittances. Given the strength of our brand, the reach of our distribution and the trust of nearly 120 million customers, we are focused on creating and delivering additional products and services that cater to the needs of the aspiring populations of the world.', 'This strategy currently includes our digital wallet, our retail money order business, our bill payment business and we have recently added products like our prepaid debit card, lending services in Argentina and Australia and a 4x currency conversion business that we have launched in select locations across Europe and APAC. We now have over 200,000 customers onboarded to our digital wallet in Europe and over 50,000 in Argentina. Our retail money order business which we have focused on over the last 18 months has grown substantially over the last couple of years with principal up nearly 20% and investable assets up over $135 million. Growth in investable assets has been important for a business that generates substantial revenue on its asset portfolio.', ""This business now accounts for roughly 1/3 of our consumer services revenue, formerly referred to as Other in our financials. With a revamped value proposition, improved distribution and a new point-of-sale system on the horizon, we are excited about continuing to see strong growth in this product ahead. As we continue this journey, our goal is not only to drive organic growth but also seek acquisition opportunities that will enable us to build stronger customer loyalty and an increase in our portion of our customers' financial wallets over time. As one of the key pillars of our Evolve 2025 strategy, we believe we are in the very early innings of this market expansion opportunity and we'll continue to invest accordingly. Finally, I would like to talk briefly about our automation journey and highlighting new partnership that we entered into in the fourth quarter."", 'We have a long history of innovation and have continued to expand our automation capabilities, resulting in cost efficiencies, higher quality output, improved customer and agent experiences and risk reduction. Over the past two years, we have made significant investments in robotic process automation, building capabilities in agent collections and reactivation, customer refund processing, risk exception decisioning, proactive agent credit limit increases and receiver name changes. While the elimination of manual processes drives cost efficiencies the speed and quality of the outputs have also led to better experiences. We are now taking a similar approach to artificial intelligence as we have with robotics including exploring ways to use generative AI in areas like software development, marketing content creation, price decisioning, customer care assistance and translation services.', 'While early in the journey, we believe generative AI has the potential to increase revenue, further improve efficiency and productivity over time and thus provide additional value to our shareholders. Last, we are pleased to announce a meaningful expansion of our relationship with Visa. This long-term global strategic relationship covers issuance, Visa Direct and further enables collaboration between the two companies across 40 countries and five regions. Visa has been a long-term strategic partner of Western Union and we are thrilled to extend this relationship for years to come. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our strategic direction and the positive progress we have made. We are pleased with the change in the underlying trajectory of our business driven by improved transaction trends across both digital and retail businesses while continuing to deliver improved top line results and strong cash flow.', 'We have also made substantial progress on our talent evolution, including a meaningful realignment of the top 100 executives at the company. This was done through both internal promotions and external hires and I believe we now have the right people in the right roles to allow us to execute on our Evolve 2025 strategy. We have a loyal customer base that trust our brand and values our services. We have a global network that provides unparalleled access and convenience to nearly 120 million people around the world and have now achieved a turnaround in transaction trends, thus validating the relevance of our offering and our brand. We have a talented and dedicated team that is focused on executing our strategy and driving innovation and we have a clear vision and early progress on how we can leverage our assets to create new revenue streams and growth opportunities.', 'I am confident that we have the right strategy, the right capabilities, the right team and the right mindset to achieve our strategic priorities. Thank you for joining the call today. I will now turn the call over to Matt to discuss our financial results and our forecast for next year in more detail.', ""Matt Cagwin: Thank you, Devin and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to walk you through our 2023 fourth quarter and full year results and our 2024 financial outlook. Before I begin, I would like to share with you the updated names of our segments more accurately reflect the underlying businesses associated with them. Our C2C segment will now be referred to as Consumer Money Transfer or CMT and our other segment will be referred to as Consumer Services or CS, as Devin mentioned earlier. The names of the segments are the only thing that changed. We have not changed the composite of the business within them. For the full year, adjusted revenue grew 4% which is meaningfully better than our original outlook of down 2% to 4% due to better core results, the benefit of Iraq and Argentinian inflation."", 'In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $1.1 billion, representing a 3% increase year-over-year. Results benefited from a 400 basis point impact from Argentinian inflation, a revenue increase from Iraq and the ongoing progress of our Evolve 2025 strategy. Fourth quarter results were above our expectations. As discussed during our last call, Iraq volume slowed in the fourth quarter. They benefited our results by 3 percentage points versus 8% benefit in the third quarter and a 10% benefit in the second quarter. For the full year, Iraq contributed 6% to adjusted revenue growth. Uncertainty remains high in Iraq due to the challenging regulatory environment. When we last spoke in October, our largest agent in the country had recently been suspended, leading us to believe that the volumes we return to levels closer to 2022.', 'This agent though, therefore, has been reactivated in early December. CMT transactions grew 5% in the quarter, led by continued momentum of our branded digital business which grew double digits Growth in our digital white label business and continued stabilization of our retail transaction trends ex Iraq. Adjusted operating margin was 16.1% compared to 15.8% last year, with the increase due to net savings related to our operating expense redeployment program and changes in foreign currency partially offset by higher marketing investments. In 2023, our full year adjusted operating margin was 19.6% which was in line with our outlook. Adjusted EPS was $0.37 versus $0.32 last year with the current period benefiting from higher operating profit and lower share count.', 'For the full year, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.74 which was meaningfully above our original outlook of $1.55 to $1.65. This was driven by better revenue performance and the benefit of our operating expense redeployment program which we partially reinvested back in the business by accelerating our go-to-market programs in both retail and branded digital as well as incremental technology investments. Now turning to our CMT business; revenue declined 1% on a constant currency basis with transaction growth of 5%. Excluding our CMT domestic money transfer business, revenue and transaction growth would have been 1 percentage point higher for both. Branded digital revenue was up 4% on a constant currency basis with transaction growth of 13%, driven by our go-to-market strategy launched in the third quarter of 2022 which showed continued momentum after reaching positive revenue growth last quarter.', ""We're excited about the sustainability of our transaction growth which has increased double digits for the third consecutive quarter while achieving positive revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter. Leading the way is North America, the first region where we launched our new go-to-market strategy which drove mid to high teens transaction growth in the fourth quarter and revenue in the high single-digit range. We are also seeing impressive results in APAC as Devin discussed earlier led by Australia which was an early adopter of our new digital platform. APAC drove mid-teens transaction growth and mid-single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter which we expect will continue to improve as we lap the go-to-market launch in mid-2023."", ""Moving to our retail business; we maintained stable transaction trends for the second consecutive quarter as we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities, including operational improvements, optimization to our network and enhancing our value proposition in the marketplace. When normalizing for Russia, Belarus and Iraq, we improved full year retail transaction growth by 500 basis points. Europe and CIS led the improvement in our retail transaction trends in the fourth quarter, with transactions growing in the low single-digit range, driven by our Evolve 2025 strategy. We also benefited as we lapsed an agent loss in the fourth quarter and have executed well on our remediation plan for the second agent that we're losing. Over the last couple of years, our European retail business has not only faced macro-related challenges like war and inflation but has also lost two important agents."", ""With this backdrop, we have taken the opportunity to test new approaches in the marketplace. For example, we opened 100 concept stores across Europe in nearly 20 markets in 2023. We also improved our value proposition in key markets, driving double-digit transaction growth in our independent channel during the second half of 2023. North America grew retail transactions low single digit in the fourth quarter continuing its momentum from the third quarter. Prior to this year, our North America retail business hadn't seen positive transaction growth since the second quarter of 2017. The enhancements we made like One Step Refund and Quick Resend helped to drive better customer and agent experience. Now moving to our Consumer Services segment formerly known as Other which represents 7% of total company revenue in the quarter."", ""Revenue for the full year was up 13% on a reported basis, while revenue in the fourth quarter was down 1%. The Revenue in the fourth quarter was impacted by tougher comparisons due to a portfolio optimization that we completed last year, further optimization of our float portfolio in the current period which resulted in a loss in the current quarter but will add value over time as well as a 5 percentage point drag related to the net impact of Argentine peso devaluation. We are excited about our Consumer Services segment with 2023 marking the second consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. With the innovations that Devin highlighted earlier today and over the past few quarters, such as our new retail money order platform launched in the fourth quarter, our prepaid card that was relaunched in the third quarter or our digital wallet that's currently live in five countries, we are bullish that we can continue to grow consumer services in the low double-digit range going forward."", ""At our Investor Day, we launched a 5-year $150 million operating expense redeployment program and we feel very good about the progress we've made to date. Broadly speaking, we see opportunity to continue to drive efficiency, manage our cost structure and leverage our scale. In 2023, we took action that allowed us to save over $50 million. The savings last year were primarily driven by talent reallocation, technology efficiencies, marketing improvements, cost and enhancements and optimizing our real estate footprint. As a result of these savings, we were able to invest in technology advancements, benefiting our ecosystem platform and our retail point-of-sale system as well as other opportunities like expanding our controlled distribution network."", ""Heading into 2024, I remain optimistic of our continued efficiency opportunities and I'm confident that we can hit a similar savings amount again this year. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet; in 2023 we generated $783 million of operating cash flow which includes a transition tax payment of $119 million paid in the second quarter. These tax payments will continue to step up to $160 million in 2024 and $200 million in 2025. I was proud of how well the organization embraced a more diligent approach to free cash flow and capital expenditure management. Capital expenditures were $31 million in the fourth quarter and $148 million in 2023. Capital expenditures were over 25% lower than 2022 and 2021. We are going to remain vigilant on investing in the right areas and shifting our agents from large signing bonuses to performance-driven commission structures."", ""Our strong free cash flow and disciplined expense management allowed us to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and debt of $2.5 billion. Our leverage ratio remains strong and we're at 2.4x and 1.2x on a gross and net basis which provides us flexibility for potential M&A, while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. This strong free cash flow also allowed us to return almost $650 million to our shareholders in 2023 which included roughly $350 million in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases, including $200 million in the fourth quarter. Now, moving on to our outlook. Today, we provided our financial outlook for 2024, reflecting current macroeconomic conditions. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion."", 'This range reflects continued growth in our branded digital business, the continued stabilization of our retail business and double-digit growth in our Consumer Services segment, driven by the advancements in our ecosystem strategy. We also expect Iraq to generate between $50 million and $100 million during the year. We also expect adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 19% to 21% and we expect EPS to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.75. Finally, we would like to provide an update on our four key performance indicators that we shared at our Investor Day. Starting with retention. In 2023, retail retention improved 70 basis points versus 2022. As we believe improving retention is a critical component to our strategy of achieving long-term sustainable growth across both our retail and digital channels.', ""Starting this year, we will report our total consumer money transfer retention. Our long-term aspiration to improve retention, 200 basis points annually hasn't changed. But we've learned a lot in 2023, including the effects of a downward pressure that growing new customers can drive. We also made good strides on improving branded digital retention with a 120 basis point improvement in 2023. We continued to believe that customer acquisition is a key metric in accelerating our growth of our branded digital business to drive more customers to our digital platform and remain committed to growing this double digit annually. In 2023, we grew customer acquisition by 13% which was even higher on a cross-border basis. Next, moving to our omni-channel."", 'At our Investor Day, we shared that this small customer base was valuable to Western Union, generating 2.5x more transactions than a single channel customer. While we initially thought our omni-channel is a permanent state for our customers, we have found that omni-channel largely serves the pass-through as they migrate between channels. Only 30% of our 2022 omni-channel customers remained omni-channel at the end of 2023 while retail to digital migration accounted for 5% of our new branded digital customers in 2023. We will continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel customer experience and building an account-based relationship with our customers instead of a transactional one and believe that these benefits will be captured in other metrics.', ""However, we will no longer report this metric going forward as we believe it's not significant to our overall business. Lastly, at Investor Day, we shared our goal to add 100,000 digital banking customers each month. However, since Investor Day, we have shifted our focus from Neobank customers to high-quality cross-border remittance customers. Additionally, as Devin highlighted today, our ecosystem strategy includes not only a digital wallet but it's broader and includes an array of products and services, including retail money order, bill payments, prepaid cards, lending products and foreign currency exchange. These results will be directly reflected in the Consumer Services segment and not our consumer money transfer segment. We continue to believe the benefits of these new products and services will drive not only higher engagement but over time, will help us improve retention as we shift to an account-based relationship."", ""As a result, our goal moving forward will be to grow our profitable Consumer Services segment revenue double-digit annually which better reflects the progress of our ecosystem strategy. To recap, we're pleased with the progress we've made so far in our Evolve 2025 strategy and we remain optimistic for the year ahead. Thank you for joining the call today and operator, we're ready to take questions."", 'See also Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks and 15 Best Bitcoin Wallets For iPhone and Android.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Devin McGranahan."", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""Good afternoon, and welcome to Western Union's Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. Now 2 years into my tenure as CEO, I am pleased with the improvements we are seeing in our trajectory under our Evolve 2025 strategy. As you know, over the last 18 months, we have focused on returning our digital business to double-digit revenue growth and achieving stability in our retail business. The fourth quarter is further evidence that we are indeed on the right path. Today, we are reporting a strong finish to the year with positive adjusted revenue growth and improved transaction trends across both our retail and digital businesses, with transaction growth north of 5% for the second consecutive quarter. Consistent and sustainable transaction growth is the strongest indicator of the future health of our business. It has been nearly a decade since the company has delivered 5% plus transaction growth for multiple quarters in a row, excluding the COVID recovery period. We are pleased with this significant change in our trajectory. Digging in, looking at a quarter-level trends, you can see the change in trajectory is both widespread and meaningful, whether looking at the U.S. to Mexico, France to Africa or the world to the Philippines. These corridors show the same picture, considerable improvements in transaction growth rates over the last 18 months. As this graph illustrates, our work over the last 18 months to improve our customer experience, streamline our operational processes and accelerate our market effectiveness is driving significantly improved outcomes. Our confidence in achieving sustainable, profitable revenue growth by 2025 increases each quarter as we stabilize our retail business, accelerate our digital business, expand our ecosystem offerings, enhance our customer and agent experiences and maintain industry-leading margins like we did this past quarter. For the fourth quarter, our revenue reached $1.050 billion, reflecting a 3% increase on a constant currency basis when excluding the contribution from Business Solutions, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share came in strong at $0.37, up 16% on a year-over-year basis and allowed us to achieve the upper end of our EPS guidance. Maintaining our long history of returning capital to shareholders, we produced another year of solid cash flow with operating cash flow of $800 million, of which $650 million was returned to our shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. As we discussed at our Investor Day in 2022, to date, we have funded all the required investments in our transformation while maintaining our 19% to 21% adjusted margins and continuing strong returns of capital to our investors. Matt will further discuss our financial results in more detail and provide our 2024 outlook later in this call. In addition to improving financial results, we continue to execute well on our strategic priorities. Over the last year, we have made meaningful progress on our most important initiatives, including improving our retail operations, updating our digital platforms and go-to-market strategy, refining our customer and agent experiences and enhancing our overall value proposition in the marketplace. While our journey is not over, I would like to share some of the highlights from this past year. Starting with our retail business. In 2023, we made material enhancements to our point-of-sale system with new functionalities like Remember Me, Quick Resend, debit payment enablement, digital receipts and enhanced payout to account capabilities. These improvements, while not groundbreaking, have made our retail customer and agent experience more competitive and have contributed significantly to the improvements you see in our retail transaction trends over the last 18 months. Additionally, we will continue to roll out these functionalities across the globe and anticipate further benefits in 2024. In addition to our point-of-sale improvements, we also made significant progress on expanding our controlled distribution strategy, which includes both owned and concept stores in LACA, Europe, the Middle East and APAC. Recall that by enabling an exclusive Western Union experience in high-impact locations, we believe we have more control over the customer experience, can test new products and services and creates a new low-cost acquisition engine for our digital business. This strategy, which prior to 2023, was largely a Latin American phenomena with owned networks in both Argentina and Brazil, has now been expanded to every region in the company. In 2023, we opened 100 new owned locations and 200 new concept stores, which increased our controlled distribution strategy by over 35%. In addition to new store openings, we also updated roughly 30,000 high-impact retail locations around the world with our new Western Union brand format, presenting a more contemporary and omni-channel message to our retail customers. To complement our controlled distribution strategy, last year, we also enhanced our digital capabilities, including launching our next-generation digital app now in 12 countries around the globe, launching a digital wallet in 4 European and 1 Latin American country and implementing a new digital go-to-market strategy. This strategy has allowed us to drive more traffic to our digital platforms, increase our conversion rates, improve our marketing messages and enhance our value proposition while materially lowering our customer acquisition costs. As evidence of this, in 2023, we were able to grow new digital customers double digits while at the same time, lowering our customer acquisition costs by over 15%. The scalable, cost-effective new customer acquisition is the foundation for continued double-digit growth of new digital transactions. Given the journey we are on, ongoing operational performance improvement is a powerful driver of agent and customer satisfaction and ultimately, will lead to improved retention. Last year, we made significant changes across key elements of our customer and agent experiences. These changes resulted in millions of fewer phone calls to our call center and improvements in both agent and customer satisfaction. For example, we improved self-service tools like our Track a Transfer to integrate across channels so that customers can get status updates on their transfer through the Western Union mobile app, regardless of whether that transfer was initiated on the app or at more than over 400,000 retail active locations around the world. As you will recall, in late 2022, we started rolling out our new digital go-to-market strategy. This strategy included revised marketing, a focus on funnel effectiveness, improved onboarding processes, promotional pricing for new customers and market-based pricing on subsequent transactions. The program has led to double-digit new customer growth and double-digit transaction growth throughout 2023. By the end of the first quarter of 2024, we will anniversary both the U.S. and the European launches of this strategy. And as such, we expect the gap between transaction growth rates and revenue growth rates to continue to narrow throughout the year. Likewise, on the retail side, last year, we also began rolling out a new go-to-market program to complement our focus on location productivity. That program included revised marketing, seasonal and holiday promotions and some corridor- and geographic-specific pricing initiatives. The majority of these actions occurred in the second and third quarters of last year, and we are now holistically happy with the results that they are producing. We believe these changes have helped us deliver positive retail transaction growth for the first time in many years and has reinforced our belief that we can achieve a stable retail business in the near future. One of the regions that have benefited immensely from these changes implemented over the last year is our APAC region, a region that has been in cyclical decline for over 5 years. APAC was early in the launch of our next-generation digital app, and they have been advancing our efforts through controlled distribution. This region now has some of the highest digital new customer growth rates, the highest digital conversion rates and has the most significant change in transaction growth rates we have seen anywhere in the world, led by Australia. Transaction growth rates in APAC have improved 1,000 basis points or more year-over-year in every quarter of 2023. This type of improvement you can see when you have the right technology, the right distribution strategy and great customer and agent experience. We believe the right user interface and a keen focus on funnel management will help us meet our expectations of returning our digital business to double-digit revenue growth. Looking ahead, while there is more work to be done and the team is committed to the ongoing continuous improvement of our core remittance business, we are also working diligently to expand our total addressable market beyond cross-border remittances. Given the strength of our brand, the reach of our distribution and the trust of nearly 120 million customers, we are focused on creating and delivering additional products and services that cater to the needs of the aspiring populations of the world. This strategy currently includes our digital wallet, our retail money order business, our bill payment business, and we have recently added products like our prepaid debit card, lending services in Argentina and Australia and a 4x currency conversion business that we have launched in select locations across Europe and APAC. We now have over 200,000 customers onboarded to our digital wallet in Europe and over 50,000 in Argentina. Our retail money order business, which we have focused on over the last 18 months, has grown substantially over the last couple of years, with principal up nearly 20% and investable assets up over $135 million. Growth in investable assets has been important for a business that generates substantial revenue on its asset portfolio. This business now accounts for roughly 1/3 of our consumer services revenue, formerly referred to as Other in our financials. With a revamped value proposition, improved distribution and a new point-of-sale system on the horizon, we are excited about continuing to see strong growth in this product ahead. As we continue this journey, our goal is not only to drive organic growth but also seek acquisition opportunities that will enable us to build stronger customer loyalty and an increase in our portion of our customers' financial wallets over time. As one of the key pillars of our Evolve 2025 strategy, we believe we are in the very early innings of this market expansion opportunity, and we'll continue to invest accordingly. Finally, I would like to talk briefly about our automation journey and highlighting new partnership that we entered into in the fourth quarter. We have a long history of innovation and have continued to expand our automation capabilities, resulting in cost efficiencies, higher-quality output, improved customer and agent experiences and risk reduction. Over the past two 2 years, we have made significant investments in robotic process automation, building capabilities in agent collections and reactivation, customer refund processing, risk exception decisioning, proactive agent credit limit increases and receiver name changes. While the elimination of manual processes drives cost efficiencies, the speed and quality of the outputs have also led to better experiences. We are now taking a similar approach to artificial intelligence as we have with robotics, including exploring ways to use generative AI in areas like software development, marketing content creation, price decisioning, customer care assistance and translation services. While early in the journey, we believe generative AI has the potential to increase revenue, further improve efficiency and productivity over time and thus provide additional value to our shareholders. Last, we are pleased to announce a meaningful expansion of our relationship with Visa. This long-term global strategic relationship covers issuance, Visa Direct and further enables collaboration between the two companies across 40 countries and five regions. Visa has been a long-term strategic partner of Western Union, and we are thrilled to extend this relationship for years to come. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our strategic direction and the positive progress we have made. We are pleased with the change in the underlying trajectory of our business, driven by improved transaction trends across both digital and retail businesses, while continuing to deliver improved top line results and strong cash flow. We have also made substantial progress on our talent evolution, including a meaningful realignment of the top 100 executives at the company. This was done through both internal promotions and external hires, and I believe we now have the right people in the right roles to allow us to execute on our Evolve 2025 strategy. We have a loyal customer base that trust our brand and values our services. We have a global network that provides unparalleled access and convenience to nearly 120 million people around the world and have now achieved a turnaround in transaction trends, thus validating the relevance of our offering and our brand. We have a talented and dedicated team that is focused on executing our strategy and driving innovation, and we have a clear vision and early progress on how we can leverage our assets to create new revenue streams and growth opportunities. I am confident that we have the right strategy, the right capabilities, the right team and the right mindset to achieve our strategic priorities. Thank you for joining the call today. I will now turn the call over to Matt to discuss our financial results and our forecast for next year in more detail."", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""Thank you, Devin, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to walk you through our 2023 fourth quarter and full-year results and our 2024 financial outlook. Before I begin, I would like to share with you the updated names of our segments to more accurately reflect the underlying businesses associated with them. Our C2C segment will now be referred to as Consumer Money Transfer or CMT, and our Other segment will be referred to as Consumer Services or CS, as Devin mentioned earlier. The names of the segments are the only thing that changed. We have not changed the composite of the business within them. For the full year, adjusted revenue grew 4%, which is meaningfully better than our original outlook of down 2% to 4% due to better core results, the benefit of Iraq and Argentinian inflation. In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $1.1 billion, representing a 3% increase year-over-year. Results benefited from a 400 basis point impact from Argentinian inflation, a revenue increase from Iraq and the ongoing progress of our Evolve 2025 strategy. Fourth quarter results were above our expectations. As discussed during our last call, Iraq volume slowed in the fourth quarter. They benefited our results by 3 percentage points versus 8% benefit in the third quarter and a 10% benefit in the second quarter. For the full year, Iraq contributed 6% to adjusted revenue growth. Uncertainty remains high in Iraq due to the challenging regulatory environment. When we last spoke in October, our largest agent in the country had recently been suspended, leading us to believe that the volumes will return to levels closer to 2022. This agent though, therefore, has been reactivated in early December. CMT transactions grew 5% in the quarter, led by continued momentum of our Branded Digital business, which grew double digits; growth in our digital white label business and continued stabilization of our retail transaction trends ex Iraq. Adjusted operating margin was 16.1% compared to 15.8% last year, with the increase due to net savings related to our operating expense redeployment program and changes in foreign currency partially offset by higher marketing investments. In 2023, our full-year adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, which was in line with our outlook. Adjusted EPS was $0.37 versus $0.32 last year, with the current period benefiting from higher operating profit and lower share count. For the full year, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.74, which was meaningfully above our original outlook of $1.55 to $1.65. This was driven by better revenue performance and the benefit of our operating expense redeployment program, which we partially reinvested back in the business by accelerating our go-to-market programs in both retail and Branded Digital as well as incremental technology investments. Now turning to our CMT business. Revenue declined 1% on a constant currency basis, with transaction growth of 5%. Excluding our CMT domestic money transfer business, revenue and transaction growth would have been 1 percentage point higher for both. Branded Digital revenue was up 4% on a constant currency basis, with transaction growth of 13%, driven by our go-to-market strategy launched in the third quarter of 2022, which showed continued momentum after reaching positive revenue growth last quarter. We're excited about the sustainability of our transaction growth, which has increased double digits for the third consecutive quarter while achieving positive revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter.Leading the way is North America, the first region where we launched our new go-to-market strategy, which drove mid to high teens transaction growth in the fourth quarter and revenue in the high single-digit range. We are also seeing impressive results in APAC, as Devin discussed earlier, led by Australia, which was an early adopter of our new digital platform. APAC drove mid-teens transaction growth and mid-single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which we expect will continue to improve as we lapped the go-to-market launch in mid-2023.Moving to our retail business. We maintained stable transaction trends for the second consecutive quarter as we continue to make progress against our strategic [priorities], including operational improvements, optimization to our network and enhancing our value proposition in the marketplace. When normalizing for Russia, Belarus and Iraq, we improved full-year retail transaction growth by 500 basis points.Europe and CIS led the improvement in our retail transaction trends in the fourth quarter, with transactions growing in the low single-digit range, driven by our Evolve 2025 strategy. We also benefited as we lapsed an agent loss in the fourth quarter and have executed well on our remediation plan for the second agent that we're losing. Over the last couple of years, our European retail business has not only faced macro-related challenges like war and inflation, but has also lost 2 important agents. With this backdrop, we have taken the opportunity to test new approaches in the marketplace. For example, we opened 100 concept stores across Europe in nearly 20 markets in 2023. We also improved our value proposition in key markets, driving double-digit transaction growth in our independent channel during the second half of 2023.North America grew retail transactions low single digit in the fourth quarter, continuing its momentum from the third quarter. Prior to this year, our North America retail business hadn't seen positive transaction growth since the second quarter of 2017. The enhancements we made, like One-Step Refund and Quick Resend, helped to drive better customer and agent experience.Now moving to our Consumer Services segment, formerly known as Other, which represents 7% of total company revenue in the quarter. Revenue for the full year was up 13% on a reported basis, while revenue in the fourth quarter was down 1%. The revenue in the fourth quarter was impacted by tougher comparisons due to a portfolio optimization that we completed last year, further optimization of our float portfolio in the current period, which resulted in a loss in the current quarter but will add value over time, as well as a 5 percentage point drag related to the net impact of Argentine peso devaluation.We are excited about our Consumer Services segment, with 2023 marking the second consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. With the innovations that Devin highlighted earlier today and over the past few quarters, such as our new retail money order platform launched in the fourth quarter, our prepaid card that was relaunched in the third quarter or our digital wallet that's currently live in 5 countries, we are bullish that we can continue to grow Consumer Services in the low double-digit range, going forward.At our Investor Day, we launched a 5-year $150 million operating expense redeployment program, and we feel very good about the progress we've made to date. Broadly speaking, we see opportunity to continue to drive efficiency, manage our cost structure and leverage our scale. In 2023, we took action that allowed us to save over $50 million. The savings last year were primarily driven by talent reallocation, technology efficiencies, marketing improvements, [cost and] enhancements and optimizing our real estate footprint. As a result of these savings, we were able to invest in technology advancements, benefiting our ecosystem platform and our retail point-of-sale system as well as other opportunities like expanding our controlled distribution network. Heading into 2024, I remain optimistic of our continued efficiency opportunities, and I'm confident that we can hit a similar savings amount again this year.Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. In 2023, we generated $783 million of operating cash flow, which includes a transition tax payment of [$119 million] paid in the second quarter. These tax payments will continue to step up to $160 million in 2024 and $200 million in 2025. I was proud of how well the organization embraced a more diligent approach to free cash flow and capital expenditure management.Capital expenditures were $31 million in the fourth quarter and $148 million in 2023. Capital expenditures were over 25% lower than 2022 and 2021. We are going to remain vigilant on investing in the right areas and shifting our agents from large signing bonuses to performance-driven commission structures.Our strong free cash flow and disciplined expense management allowed us to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and debt of $2.5 billion. Our leverage ratio remains strong, and we're at 2.4x and 1.2x on a gross and net basis, which provides us flexibility for potential M&A, while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. This strong free cash flow also allowed us to return almost $650 million to our shareholders in 2023, which included roughly $350 million in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases, including $200 million in the fourth quarter.Now moving on to our outlook. Today, we provided our financial outlook for 2024, reflecting current macroeconomic conditions. We expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. This range reflects continued growth in our Branded Digital business, the continued stabilization of our retail business and double-digit growth in our Consumer Services segment, driven by the advancements in our ecosystem strategy. We also expect Iraq to generate between $50 million and $100 million during the year. We also expect adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 19% to 21%, and we expect EPS to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.75.Finally, we would like to provide an update on our four key performance indicators that we shared at our Investor Day. Starting with retention. In 2023, retail retention improved 70 basis points versus 2022. As we believe improving retention is a critical component to our strategy of achieving long-term sustainable growth across both our retail and digital channels, starting this year, we will report our total consumer money transfer retention. Our long-term aspiration to improve retention, 200 basis points annually, hasn't changed. But we've learned a lot in 2023, including the effects of a downward pressure that growing new customers can drive. We also made good strides on improving Branded Digital retention with a 120 basis point improvement in 2023.We continued to believe that customer acquisition is a key metric in accelerating our growth of our Branded Digital business to drive more customers to our digital platform and remain committed to growing this double digit annually. In 2023, we grew customer acquisition by 13%, which was even higher on a cross-border basis.Next, moving to our omni-channel. At our Investor Day, we shared that this small customer base was valuable to Western Union, generating 2.5x more transactions than a single-channel customer. While we initially thought our omni-channel is a permanent state for our customers, we have found that omni-channel largely serves the pass-through as they migrate between channels. Only 30% of our 2022 omni-channel customers remained omni-channel at the end of 2023, while retail-to-digital migration accounted for 5% of our new Branded Digital customers in 2023. We will continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel customer experience and building an account-based relationship with our customers instead of a transactional one and believe that these benefits will be captured in other metrics. However, we will no longer report this metric, going forward, as we believe it's not significant to our overall business.Lastly, at Investor Day, we shared our goal to add 100,000 digital banking customers each month. However, since Investor Day, we have shifted our focus from neobank customers to high-quality cross-border remittance customers. Additionally, as Devin highlighted today, our ecosystem strategy includes not only a digital wallet, but it's broader and includes an array of products and services, including retail money order, bill payments, prepaid cards, lending products and foreign currency exchange. These results will be directly reflected in the Consumer Services segment and not our Consumer Money Transfer segment. We continue to believe the benefits of these new products and services will drive not only higher engagement, but over time, will help us improve retention as we shift to an account-based relationship. As a result, our goal, moving forward, will be to grow our profitable Consumer Services segment revenue double-digit annually, which better reflects the progress of our ecosystem strategy.To recap, we're pleased with the progress we've made so far in our Evolve 2025 strategy, and we remain optimistic for the year ahead. Thank you for joining the call today. And operator, we're ready to take questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes to us from Will Nance from Goldman Sachs.', 'William Alfred Nance', ""Maybe I can start off with some of the comments that you made around omni-channel customers. I know you previously talked around the retail digital escalator over time. And I know you're not focusing on having omni-channel customers anymore. But I guess when you see these customers get off the escalator, do you still see them transacting at much higher levels? And is there any kind of overall change in your thought process about the value of these customers?"", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""Hi will, it's Devin. Indeed, you are correct. One of the reasons, as Matt highlighted, that we're making this change is the real economic benefit to us is that retail to digital escalator. And as Matt highlighted, 5% of our new customers -- digital customers in 2023 were prior retail customers, those customers turn out to have better retention and stronger ARPUs than customers that we acquire de novo as new-to-franchise digital customers. So growing and increasing our ability through omni-channel activities, but the focus really is on the escalator and less on a pool of customers who live in both retail and digital. And, we think it gives -- well, it gives us a cost benefit advantage in terms of our overall CAC. And so our ability to continue to grow the digital customer base and using the retail base as a feeder is an important part of the strategy and will be reflected in our ability to continue to grow new digital customers."", 'William Alfred Nance', ""And then just maybe a different question on some of the guidance and the kind of the guidance philosophy, particularly around reinvestment. Just a couple of data points that I'm picking up. I guess, it came a little bit ahead of expectations on revenue. We saw the expenses come in much higher, bottom line, kind of roughly in line with expectations, sort of a similar dynamic going on in the full-year guide. I think if we look at revenue ex Iraq, that's coming in a little bit lower than maybe what you previously talked about kind of later last year. We're still seeing earnings overall coming in roughly in line with expectations and the Iraq revenues kind of helping out.So just when you constructed that guide, how did the incremental Iraqi revenues that maybe you weren't expecting when you spoke to us in December, how did that kind of factor into the construction of the guide? Is there any conservatism in the overall numbers to account for the uncertainty in Iraq? And did you guys make any incremental investments on the revenue side that may have impacted the ex Iraq numbers in light of these incremental revenues?"", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""Main focus we've got is obviously on the top line and EPS. Sometimes you hit up the items down in Other, which [why you make] further investments if you got the right thing to invest in. But on your question about Iraq itself, we have made a fair bit of pricing actions during 2023 that have a carryover effect into 2024 as well, as we continue to monitor that. So that's been factored into our thinking here. The opportunity as we get into '24, as we gave them the $50 million to $100 million range, is slightly higher than we would have thought back in December when we met or November, I think it may have been actually, but not meaningfully higher. We just knew we had a carryover effect of the actions we took this past year."", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""It's still a highly uncertain situation. Our main settlement partner has notified us that they will not settle for us for our cash exchange, retail customers in Iraq at the end of the first quarter. That's a significant portion of our volume. And while we continue to look for alternatives to that, we really, I think, have put into the guide a reasonable outcome, given the uncertainty of what may or may not transaction post-March."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes to us from Andrew Schmidt from Citi.', 'Andrew Garth Schmidt', ""This is just a higher-level question to start off with. Obviously, you look at U.S. migration trends, been pretty robust, only one market but clearly the biggest outbound market in the world. I'm wondering, to what extent you're seeing that show up in your results? I know that you mentioned pretty positive, I think, double-digit transaction growth in the independent channel. And I know it's a mix of self-improvement initiatives also in there. But I'm curious, to what extent you're seeing that positive remittance or I should say positive migration trends show up in your results?"", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""Andrew, it's a great question. Thank you for joining the call today. We are seeing the benefit. In fact, our business is driven by, as you know, two primary factors: Overall global macroeconomic growth and by migration. And so the increased migration into North America over the last couple of years is benefiting, particularly those outbound corridors from the U.S. to certain regions in Latin America. And so we see double-digit transaction growth in those corridors as a result of the migration. .There's less of that when Matt was talking about the improved transaction trends in retail in Europe. There's been less net migration into Europe over the last year or two. And so that is more of a result of kind of ongoing performance improvement enhancing the quality of our distribution network and our stronger go-to-market value proposition there."", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""(inaudible) Devin's comment is you're focusing on the specific question you asked. But holistically, we believe the hard work we're doing with our agents and our customers is really driving the progress we're making. I think we have a modest tailwind, as Devin just described. But when you look at it, we're now starting to move from being a share donor to holding our fair share with a little bit of tailwind from this."", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""And Mexico is the perfect corridor example, where for many years, we were probably losing share U.S. to Mexico. In the last 12 months, we've returned back to growing share in that important corridor. And obviously, it's in a corridor that, the Central Bank of Mexico publishes, is growing in the mid- to high single digits year-over-year."", 'Andrew Garth Schmidt', ""And then if I could dig into just the Branded Digital transaction growth up 13% this quarter, and I know you elaborated on this a little bit, but if you could break down just the drivers of that, whether it's new customer growth, whether it's retention, whether it's behavior, transactions per customer, any additional just the disaggregation of that would be helpful just so we can get a better understanding of the underlying mechanics of that transaction growth."", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""I mean really, it's all three. I highlighted a few of the components [in] back into the third, but I highlighted in the metrics conversation at the end that our retention has improved in Branded Digital by 110 basis points in 2023. We've also highlighted that we continue to grow our new customers in the double-digit range. Full year, it was 13%. And then we are seeing a little bit of an uptick in transactions per customer, but that's the lower [of the three]."", 'Operator', ""We're gonna go back to Vasu Govil."", 'Vasundhara Govil', ""Hopefully, you guys can hear me this time. I guess my first question for you, Devin, on the digital wallet strategy. Historically, you've been focused on sort of positioning that wallet to drive more retention and engagement. And I think today, the description you guys gave, it seemed like you were focusing a little bit on the revenue potential there as well. Is that a fair read?"", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""Vasu, I might slightly reframe that. We are focusing on growing revenue from our overall ecosystem strategy. And we believe that, that is an important metric to gauge our ability to return Western Union to profitable revenue growth as part of our Evolve 2025 strategy. A component of that is, in fact, growing our digital wallet, which we believe will primarily benefit retention as it is a more account-based relationship and thus will drive increased revenue through lower customer churn and obviously, the increased ARPU from extended customers.So while we still have a strong focus on growing our digital wallet, we're doing so more with a focus on our remittance business and on driving retention with our digital remittance customers by them having more of an account-based relationship, which we believe will drive revenue of ancillary products and services, including interchange, including bill payment, including other services that are available digitally in the wallet that's not available in our traditional transaction cross-border remittance platform."", 'Vasundhara Govil', 'And then a quick one for you, Matt. I was wondering on the margin guidance for 2024, if you could help us a little bit about what to expect for the cadence throughout the year.', 'Matthew Cagwin', ""It's going to bounce around, it's going to be not linear. We kept the guidance of the [19 to 21] because we think as revenue accelerates as to provide us incremental profitable revenue growth, is you have opportunity to make investments that will pull it down. Our goal is to hit the number throughout the full year, but any given quarter, can bounce around. I can't really guide to that at this point."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes to us from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.', 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""I just want to ask on the customer additions. I know it's trending nicely with double digits, but also the acquisition cost has been lower. How do you expect those two dynamics to trend here in '24 ahead? Can we count on acquisition costs staying lower? Or is there a potential to maybe turn that down differently?"", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""I think we saw a further opportunity. As Devin talked about earlier, we have generative AI we're working on. We've done some things around robotics. Bob, who leads that organization, has been with the company now for 18 months, and he's continuing to add skills into the organization. So we think there's further opportunity as we enhance that as far as we're rolling out incremental or new digital platform in different countries that will provide additional opportunities. So we don't see pressure on that. I can't say it's going to be the same level of reduction in 2024 that we did in '23, but we do see opportunity to keep making enhancements there."", 'Devin B. McGranahan', 'Tien-Tsin, one of the things we talk a lot about, which is our ability to scale at cost-effective tax around the world, right? And so in some markets that are exceptionally well developed, like the U.S., the team has done a very nice job of that, what you see in the strong customer growth in the mid- to upper-teen transaction levels that we saw last year. As we work our way around the world, increasing our capabilities to scale marketing acquisition and to do it cost effectively will be one of our priorities in 2024.', 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""Just my last follow-up, just the Consumer Services, expectations for double-digit growth again in '24, should other components going to be different? I know there's [float] and other things to consider, but anything to call out there or rank the bigger contributors?"", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""Yes. So I think as you think about this year and last year, the vast majority of the growth has come through our legacy products that we had there, bill pay and money order. As you highlighted, there's been a little bit of a tailwind from higher interest rates, we do have a relatively moderate term, as we disclosed, it is probably about 4, 4.5 years, is the duration for our investments there. So feel good about '24 for where we are in interest. Devin has talked about in these calls, the number of new products we put there, whether it be prepaid, ForEx, revamping our money order business and so forth. As you get into 2024 and beyond, we think that we're going to start seeing a larger portion of our growth coming from those new product additions."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes to us from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.', 'Darrin David Peller', ""I guess my question is really more around just the trend line. Devin, I linked your comment about the narrowing between the transaction growth trends, which we've seen improving consistently, and the revenue growth trends, which is still -- I mean, if you calculate the Iraq and Argentina impact, still, I think, around negative 4%, unchanged. So you've seen transactions improve. Revenue seems like there's going to be a lag to it, but you did comment on the narrowing. So can you just get a little more detail on that? Because I think that's the crux of what -- I know we and some investors are looking for to follow on from the obvious improvements you're having in the transaction side of the business."", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""Hi, Darrin. Indeed, we are closely monitoring that gap. And I think we've talked about three things in the past, which I'll reiterate: One, our long-term aspiration is to maintain the ratio between transactions and revenue to be a 200 to 300 basis point gap as we kind of continue to evolve our business. And so our goal is to get revenue up to reach that 200 to 300 basis point gap during the duration of our Evolve 2025 strategy.The second is the way we rolled out, particularly on the digital side, but also on the retail side; our revised go-to-market strategy, which was kind of on a region-by-region basis, create some lumpiness as to how you see that gap close because of the effects of the new region rolling into it. As I commented on the public prepared notes, we will be lapping, at least on the digital side, both the North American and European, which is the preponderance of our digital business by the end of this quarter. So the acceleration in closing the gap will -- the gap -- closure will accelerate in the second half of this year.And then third, we are continuing to iterate as we go across segments, geographies and channels. And so as we've always said, we compete in a lot of different places around the world, so we'll continue to optimize. But our goal really is to close that gap and to close it over the course of the duration of our strategy."", 'Darrin David Peller', ""I guess just one quick follow-up would be around the -- is there any read on retention metrics on cohorts you gained via the promotional efforts now over the last year or so in the U.S.? It's just -- again, it looks like it's great to see the transaction trends. Just curious to know a little more on the puts and takes of net new versus retention."", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""We've highlighted, probably it's been two quarters now, but we continue to see strong results in the 90-day, 180-day retention for the newer cohorts that are coming in through promotional pricing. It's driven through the reengagement campaigns we've talked about in past calls, having better market-based pricing, more streamlined transaction processing, as well as we're starting to target companies that are doing ATM transactions, which have a higher retention rate as well. And we continue to see a high 20s, low 30% growth rate in our APN business, both in the retail and digital side."", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""APN being payout to account. The other thing, I think, Darrin, you can look at, Matt talked about the 110 basis point improvement in digital transactions year-over-year. That is the composition of our history, i.e., the accumulated book. And as you know, as customers tenure in this category, retention goes up. So we've been growing new customers aggressively but increasing the overall retention of the book, which says something about the quality of the new customers and the retention in that subset of the portfolio in order to achieve that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes to us from Ken Suchoski from Autonomous.', 'Kenneth Christopher Suchoski', ""I just wanted to ask a couple on the physical retail business, and maybe we can exclude Iraq just to strip out some of the noise. The revenue per transaction in that part of the business has declined over the last handful of quarters. So I was wondering if you could talk about what's causing that revenue per transaction decline in physical retail ex Iraq?And then it looks like over the last few quarters, pricing adjustments were needed to accelerate transaction growth in that part of the business. So do you think your -- do you think the lower pricing in that physical retail ex Iraq is sort of behind you? Or do you feel like you need to be more aggressive on that front to accelerate transaction growth even further into -- as you go throughout the year?"", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""Ken, thank you very much for the question. As you think about the change in RPT ex Iraq over the last, call it, year, about 2/3 of that is really mix driven, and you have about the remaining portion being more conscious price reductions that we've done. We've started doing some tests, we talked about it in the last call, in a large European country, where we changed our FX yields multiple times throughout the day to be competitive, which is driving pricing. We've done some other tests around the world that we've now kept permanent for many of them. So it's a little bit of a mix of both, of mix and conscious decision to drive performance.But one that we'll highlight, you've seen in our charts both this quarter's past, you can see improvements in our transaction trends prior to sort of push in price changes in Q2 and Q3 as we were starting to do additional work with our agents and our customers on both the product side and customer service. So to us, we believe that really all three elements are making a difference. It's not a battle about price only, it's a matter of having market-competitive prices with great service, great product. As far as the future, we're always going to be adjusting the market, looking what competitors do. So -- but we are committed to our guidance."", 'Kenneth Christopher Suchoski', ""And then what's the expectation around revenue growth in the physical retail business in 2024, I guess, including and excluding Iraq? Because it looks like you'll start to lap some of the Iraq revenue contribution in the first quarter of this year."", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""Yes. So again, we're not going to give out guidance at the segment level really for most things."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes to us from Tyler DuPont from Bank of America.', 'Tyler DuPont', ""I wanted to first touch on the current geopolitical events in the Middle East. Given your geographic footprint, not specific to Israel or anything, but sort of the region more broadly, are there any dynamics you're seeing worth calling out, whether those are change in money transfer volumes or mix between retail and digital or just any other dynamics that are worth considering that haven't been mentioned so far?"", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""We've seen very -- obviously, overall volumes in the region are down, but they haven't gone to zero. And there's been little change in terms of the mix of retail and digital. It's predominantly a retail environment in that part of the world. We continue to monitor it, but the overall region itself is relatively small relative to our total business. So we're more concerned about the lives of the people, protecting our agents, our employees and hoping that the conflict ends quickly than the economic impacts for our business."", 'Tyler DuPont', ""And then just as a follow-up, I believe you mentioned in the prepared remarks that customer acquisition cost declined by around 15% in the year. Can you speak to how the company's LTV to CAC has evolved throughout 2023? And how you anticipate this metric will continue to evolve through 2024, particularly as we're shifting the mindset from more of an omni-channel focus to selling Consumer Services to just sort of the dynamics there and any pieces to the puzzle worth noting?"", 'Matthew Cagwin', ""If you think about it, we've highlighted a couple of key drivers of that math. We've talked about the fact that our digital retention has improved by 110 basis points, that's pushing the life out longer for historical customers over -- before making this change. We've reduced our rates to some degree. And then we've obviously lowered our CAC. Holistically, it's about the same as it was before for those moving parts."", 'Devin B. McGranahan', ""And I would add two things to it. As you know, when we launched this program, which is now 18 months into the program, we made the explicit shift, which here to before, we had not managed to, which was to a target LTV to CAC goal. And so we've maintained that goal throughout the program. And as either LTV or CAC adjust, we adjust accordingly in terms of our marketing spend and our ability to drive new programs into the marketplace. And so as LTV goes up, that enables us to spend more. As CAC cat goes down, that enables us to spend more. And obviously, in reverse, hopefully, that won't happen. But if it did, then we would spend less."", 'Operator', 'We have no additional questions in the queue at this time.', 'Thomas Hadley', 'Thank you for joining the Western Union Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ynon."", 'Ynon Kreiz', ""Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. 2023 was a milestone year for Mattel. We extended our leadership in our key toy categories and gained significant share overall, achieved extraordinary success with the Barbie movie and further strengthened our financial position. Fourth quarter results saw meaningful sales growth and margin expansion. Consumer demand for our products increased, and we continued to outpace the industry. Full year sales were comparable to the prior year, with gross margin expansion and significant increase in cash flow. Execution on our toy strategy was strong, considering we entered 2023 with a challenging retail inventory headwind and faced a toy industry decline during the year. We also made meaningful progress on our entertainment strategy across film, television, digital and publishing. We achieved an investment-grade rating and resumed share repurchases for the first time since 2014. We ended 2023 with the strongest balance sheet we have had in years, with more resources to execute our strategy. Looking at key financial metrics for the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Net sales increased 16% as reported or 14% in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin improved 570 basis points to 48.8%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 48% to $234 million. POS increased low single digits in the quarter as we worked closely with our retail partners to meet the demand for our product. Looking at key financial metrics for the full year as compared to the prior year. Net sales were comparable or down 1% in constant currency, with growth in 3 or 4 regions. Adjusted gross margin improved 160 basis points to 47.5%. Adjusted EBITDA was $948 million, a decline of 2%. Free cash flow increased by $453 million to $709 million, and we ended the year with over $1.2 billion of cash after utilizing $203 million to repurchase shares. POS grew low single digits for the year and was up in 3 or 4 regions. Per Circana, in the fourth quarter, Mattel gained share globally, driven by increases in Dolls and Vehicles as well as Games and Building Sets. For the full year, Mattel gained 70 basis points of share globally, driven by increases in Dolls and Vehicles as well as gains in Infant, Toddler and Preschool and Building Sets. Mattel was the #2 global toy company for the quarter and year, and the #1 toy company in the U.S. for the 30th consecutive year, where we achieved the largest annual share gain on record. The global toy industry declined 7% in 2023 per Circana. That said, this followed extraordinary growth of 25% from 2019 to 2022, reaching an all-time high. It should be noted, the industry in 2023 was 17% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic and the third largest ever. We are successfully executing our strategy to grow Mattel's IP-driven toy business and expand our entertainment offering. As it relates to our Toy business, we made significant progress in scaling our portfolio, growing our franchise brands and advancing e-commerce and D2C. We successfully relaunched catalog IP and continued to strengthen our relationships with major entertainment partners and key retailers. In 2023, Barbie was the #1 doll property globally, and #2 toy property overall. Hot Wheels gross billings achieved its sixth consecutive record year. Monster High was successfully relaunched globally and was the largest growth property in Dolls. Disney Princess and Frozen performance was strong in its first full year back at Mattel. Infant, Toddler, Preschool continued to optimize the portfolio with new product innovation and expanded its Little People Collector business. Mattel Creations, our D2C business serving adult fans, continue to grow, with user traffic up over 90%. And the company received an industry-leading 15 Toy of the Year nominations and 7 awards, including for design and marketing. For our Entertainment business, this was a breakout year as we demonstrated the power of our IP and demand creation capabilities. The Barbie movie was a cultural phenomenon, achieving the largest global box office in 2023, becoming Warner Bros. highest box office movie in its 100-year history and the industry's 14th largest box office of all time. The movie, its filmmakers and all-star cast, as well as the Barbie album have received multiple nominations and awards, highlighted by 8 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. The Barbie album was honored on Sunday night with Grammy Awards for Compilation Soundtrack, Song of the Year and Best Song Written for Visual Media. In addition to the fourth and live-action movies in development, we recently announced Mattel Films' first animated movie, Bob the Builder. Award-winning actor and recording artist, Anthony Ramos, will voice the title character; and coproduced with Oscar-winning Animation Studio, ShadowMachine and Jennifer Lopez' Nuyorican Productions. We also announced our partnership with Paramount Pictures to develop the American Girl live-action feature film. Mattel Television Studios premiered 12 series and specials, including Monster High, Hot Wheels, Polly Pocket, Barbie, Thomas & Friends, Fireman Sam and Pictionary, as well as a Monster High movie sequel. In Digital Gaming, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 Turbocharged was released, and the first stand-alone Barbie game on Roblox was launched, achieving over 130 million visits since October. The Mattel163 joint venture grew its mobile gaming revenues to almost $200 million in 2023. We also launched our own book publishing business, Mattel Press, with sales and distribution managed by Simon & Schuster. We continue to improve operations and achieved $132 million of cost savings in 2023. We successfully concluded the Optimizing for Growth Program, which achieved total annualized savings of $343 million between 2021 and 2023, well beyond our initial target of $250 million and revised target of $300 million. Today, we announced a new Optimizing for Profitable Growth Program that will target an additional $200 million of annualized savings between 2024 and 2026. The program's aim is to achieve further efficiencies and cost-saving opportunities that we believe can further improve our productivity, profitability and competitive position. Aligned with our capital deployment strategy, Mattel's Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We were also pleased to announce earlier today that Julius Genachowski and Dawn Ostroff have joined Mattel's Board of Directors. Julius and Dawn are respected leaders who have extensive combined experience in media, entertainment and technology and bring expertise in finance, M&A and government regulation. Todd Bradley and Ann Lewnes recently stepped down from the Board, and I would like to thank them for the many years of dedicated service. We are grateful for their support and guidance and playing an active role during their tenure. We are also excited to welcome Chris Farrell, who recently joined the company as Chief Strategy Officer. Chris brings expertise in strategic planning, M&A, corporate development and investment banking in the consumer and retail sectors. These additions will serve Mattel well as we execute our strategy, explore growth opportunities and enhance long-term shareholder value. In terms of our expectations for the year, we believe we are well positioned competitively and will continue to outpace the industry and gain market share. We expect the toy industry to decline in 2024, although at a lesser rate than 2023. The anticipated decline is due to a lighter theatrical film slate and the impact of the shift in consumer spending patterns towards experiences and services, which we believe will moderate over the year. Our 2024 plan emphasizes growth in profitability, gross margin expansion, and strong cash generation. With the benefit of a strong balance sheet and consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we intend to explore M&A and other corporate development opportunities as well as repurchase shares. Some of the highlights for 2024 include Barbie's 65th anniversary celebration and related activations, as well as innovation in new segments and play patterns. Hot Wheels will expand its die-cast universe and benefit from a new animated series on Netflix. Fisher-Price will expand its core product lines, introduce an exciting new segment and extend its license entertainment offerings. And our Challenger categories will bring more innovative products to market. We look forward to sharing more details at our investor event in March, including our category strategies as well as power brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price. In addition, we will continue to progress our entertainment strategy in film and television as well as digital and live experiences. We expect Mattel's net sales in constant currency for the full year to be comparable to prior year and for adjusted EPS to grow double digit and be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $500 million. We expect our full year POS to be comparable to 2023 and aim to outpace the toy industry and gain market share. Beyond 2024, we believe toy industry trends will further improve and that the industry will return to growth and continue to grow over the long term. The fundamentals of the toy business are strong. Toys are an important part of consumers' lives, and retailers see the category as a strategic lever. For Mattel, we expect to grow sales and earnings in 2025 with the anticipated benefit of improving industry trends, innovation in toys, expansion of our entertainment offering and licensing partnerships as well as savings from our Optimizing for Profitable Growth Program. In closing, 2023 was defined by our strong execution in both toys and entertainment. Consumer demand for our products continue to grow and meaningful market share gains demonstrated the strength of our portfolio as a whole. The breakout success of the award-winning Barbie movie was a showcase for our entertainment strategy and cultural relevance of our brands outside the toy aisle. Mattel is in the strongest financial position it has been in years, with significant free cash flow generation, an optimization program and a new share repurchase authorization. As we start a new year, we believe we are well positioned to continue the successful execution of our multiyear strategy to grow our IP-driven toy business and expand our entertainment offering and create long-term shareholder value. Anthony will cover the financials in more detail."", 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""Thanks, Ynon. As expected, we had a very strong fourth quarter, with double-digit top and bottom line growth compared to the prior year. Net sales of $1.621 billion increased 16% or 14% in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin increased 570 basis points to 48.8%. Adjusted operating income was $147 million, an increase of $68 million or 86%, primarily driven by sales growth and gross margin expansion partly offset by an incentive-driven increase in SG&A. Adjusted EPS was $0.29 compared to $0.18 a year ago, an increase of 61%. And adjusted EBITDA was $234 million, an increase of $76 million. Looking at our full year performance. Net sales were flat or down 1%, excluding the positive impact of currency translation. Adjusted gross margin increased 160 basis points to 47.5%, benefiting from cost savings, pricing and the Barbie movie. Adjusted operating income was $641 million compared to $689 million in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.23 compared to $1.25 last year. And adjusted EBITDA finished the year at $948 million compared to $968 million in the prior year. Retailers ended the year with inventory down high single digits as measured in both dollars and weeks of supply. While they made significant progress in 2023, retailer inventories remain slightly elevated compared to historical norms. Turning to gross billings in constant currency, beginning with the fourth quarter. Gross billings increased 16%, with growth in our 3 leader categories, including double-digit growth in all 3 power brands, Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price, as well as growth in our Challenger categories collectively. POS increased low single digits as we continued to outpace the industry and gain market share. As previously discussed, shipping patterns have returned to historical trends with approximately 2/3 of annual gross billings in the second half, which has favorably impacted our fourth quarter gross billings performance in comparison to the prior year. Dolls increased 27%, driven primarily by Barbie, Disney Princess and Frozen and Monster High. POS for the category increased low double digits. Barbie had a very strong finish to the year with fourth quarter growth of 24%, driven by toys and benefits associated with the movie. Vehicles achieved another quarter of growth, increasing 15%, driven by a 16% increase in Hot Wheels, which benefited from die-cast cars and continued innovation across multiple segments. POS increased mid-single digits. Infant, Toddler and Preschool increased by 7%, driven by double-digit growth in Fisher-Price. POS declined high single digits. Challenger categories, in aggregate, increased by 1%, primarily driven by Games, partly offset by a decline in Action Figures. POS declined high single digits, primarily due to Action Figures. Turning to the full year. Gross billings declined by 1%, primarily due to the negative impact of retailer inventory reductions and Russia, partly offset by the benefits from low single-digit POS growth and the very successful Barbie movie. Mattel outpaced the industry and gained 70 points of global market share per Circana. Dolls increased 13%, in line with POS, driven by Disney Princess and Frozen, Monster High and Barbie, partly offset by a decline in American Girl. Barbie increased 2%. The total impact from our direct movie participation, movie-related toy sales and consumer products, generated more than $150 million in sales with a blended operating income margin of approximately 60%. POS was flat. Mattel outperformed the industry in the Dolls category and gained 750 basis points of market share for the full year per Circana. Vehicles had another outstanding year growing 11%, in line with POS, driven by Hot Wheels die-cast and the successful extension of the brand into the skate and RC segments. Hot Wheels achieved its sixth consecutive record year. Mattel outpaced the industry in the Vehicles category, gained 280 basis points of market share, reaching its highest global market share on record per Circana. Infant, Toddler and Preschool declined 12% due to ImagineX, wrapping theatrical times in the prior year, and BabyGear, partly offset by Little People. POS declined high single digits. Despite the decline, Mattel outperformed the industry gained 10 basis points of market share and extended its #1 position within the category per Circana. Challenger categories declined 25% due primarily to action figures comping a strong film fleet in the prior year. POS declined low double digits. Building Sets and Games each grew gross billings for the year. Per Circana, Mattel gained market share in Building Sets for the full year. Looking at our fourth quarter performance by region. Growth was primarily driven by North America. Gross billings in North America increased 33%, benefiting from the return to historical shipping patterns. POS increased mid-single digits. EMEA grew 1% and while POS was up mid-single digits, growing ahead of the market. Asia Pacific increased 6%, driven by growth in Australia and New Zealand. POS increased mid-single digits. Latin America increased 1% and POS was down mid-single digits due to softness in Brazil. Looking at our full year performance on a regional basis. Gross billings in North America increased 1% with POS comparable to the prior year. Mattel outpaced the industry and gained 90 basis points of market share in North America, per Circana. EMEA declined 7%, including a negative 6 percentage point impact from Russia. POS, excluding Russia, increased high single digits. Mattel outpaced the industry and gained market share in EMEA, per Circana. Latin America increased 3%, in line with POS. Mattel gained market share and expanded its market leadership position in Latin America, per Circana. Asia Pacific increased 11%, while POS increased low single digits. Mattel outpaced the industry and gained market share in the region, per Circana. Adjusted gross margin was 48.8% in the quarter, compared to 43.1% in the prior year, an increase of 570 basis points. The significant increase in adjusted gross margin was driven by several factors. Cost deflation contributed 340 basis points; lower inventory management costs, primarily obsolescence and close-ups, added 150 basis points; savings from the Optimizing for Growth program added 130 basis points; favorable mix, primarily margin benefit related to the Barbie movie, added 70 basis points; and pricing, net of higher sales adjustments added 20 basis points. Going the other way, increased royalties and other factors had a negative impact of 140 basis points. For the full year, adjusted gross margin increased by 160 basis points to 47.5%. The improvement was primarily driven by cost savings, the favorable mix impact associated with the Barbie movie and pricing partly offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to lower production volume and other supply chain costs. Moving down to P&L. In the fourth quarter, advertising expenses declined 3% to $234 million. During the fourth quarter, we shifted some of our support from advertising to promotions, which are reflected in higher sales adjustments. For the full year, advertising expense declined 2% to $525 million. As expected, SG&A increased significantly due to incentive compensation. Adjusted SG&A in the fourth quarter increased by $127 million to $409 million, reflecting above-target incentive compensation. For the full year, adjusted SG&A increased $147 million due to incentive compensation and salary and market-related pay, partly offset by savings from the Optimizing for Growth program. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $147 million, an increase of $68 million or 86% compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by net sales growth and gross margin expansion, partly offset by higher SG&A. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $76 million to $234 million, driven by the same factors. Adjusted EPS increased 61% to $0.29. For the year, adjusted operating income declined $47 million to $641 million, and adjusted EBITDA declined $21 million to $948 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.23 compared to $1.25 in the prior year. EPS performance benefited from higher interest income, a lower adjusted tax rate and a lower share count resulting from our share repurchase activity. We generated very significant cash flow in 2023. Cash from operations almost doubled to $870 million compared to $443 million in the prior year, an increase of $427 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved working capital performance. Working capital was a source of funds in 2023, driven primarily by inventory reductions compared to a use of funds in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $160 million compared to $187 million in the prior year and lower than our expectations, primarily due to the timing of expenditures on capacity additions. Free cash flow was $709 million compared to $256 million, an increase of $453 million. The increase was primarily driven by cash from operations and lower capital expenditures. As a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow conversion was 75% compared to 26% in the prior year. During 2023, we utilized $203 million of cash to repurchase shares, fully utilizing the company's existing authorization. Taking a look at the balance sheet. We meaningfully improved our financial position. We finished the year with a cash balance of $1.261 billion compared to $761 million in the prior year. The increase reflects our free cash flow performance for 2023, net of share repurchases. Total debt was $2.330 billion, consistent with the prior year. Our debt portfolio is well positioned, with no scheduled maturities until 2026. Accounts receivable increased by $222 million, in line with fourth quarter sales growth to $1.082 billion. We made significant progress reducing owned inventory levels. Inventory at year-end was $572 million compared to $894 million in the prior year, a reduction of $322 million and a key contributor to free cash flow. Consistent with our expectations, debt to adjusted EBITDA finished the year at 2.5x, excluding the benefit of our cash balance. This compares to 2.4x in the prior year. Under our Optimizing for Growth program, we achieved cost savings of $46 million in the quarter and $132 million in the year. We have now completed this program. Under this program, we achieved total annualized savings of $343 million between 2021 and 2023, exceeding our initial target of $250 million and revised goal of $300 million. We recognize the importance of managing our cost structure and continuing to expand margins as well as generating savings that can be reinvested in the business. Today, we are announcing a new 3-year program that we are calling Optimizing for Profitable Growth or OPG. The program's aim is to achieve efficiencies, leveraging our scale and cost savings opportunities within our global supply chain, including our manufacturing footprint that we believe can further improve productivity, profitability and our competitive position. We are targeting $200 million of annualized savings between 2024 and 2026 under this new program, which includes the previously disclosed initiative to close a plant in China. In terms of the P&L, we anticipate approximately 70% of the expected savings to benefit cost of goods sold and the remaining 30% to benefit SG&A. Costs and investments to implement the program are estimated to be between $130 million to $170 million, which will be updated as the program advances. We have a strong track record of achieving cost savings and are confident in our ability to execute this new program. As Ynon said, we expect the toy industry to decline in 2024 and for Mattel to outpace the industry and continue to gain global market share. For 2024, we expect net sales in constant currency to be comparable to the prior year, with growth in Vehicles, offset by a decline in Dolls as we wrap the benefits of the Barbie movie. We expect Infant, Toddler and Preschool as well as our Challenger categories collectively to be comparable to the prior year. With respect to the power brands, we expect Hot Wheels to grow, Fisher-Price to be comparable and for Barbie to decline. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the American Girl business is being integrated into our North America commercial organization. As a result, American Girl will no longer be an operating segment. Foreign currency translation is not expected to have a material impact on our top line performance based on current spot rates. Adjusted gross margin is expected to increase from 47.5% in 2023 to a range of 48.5% to 49%. The forecasted improvement is primarily driven by savings from our OPG program and favorable fixed cost absorption from increased production levels, partly offset by wrapping the Barbie movie benefit. We expect advertising and adjusted SG&A to remain relatively stable as a percent of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion compared to $948 million in the prior year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow double digits to a range of $1.35 to $1.45 compared to $1.23 in 2023. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be 23% to 24% compared to the prior year rate of 23%. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million, and free cash flow is expected to be approximately $500 million. As Ynon said, we are well positioned and expect to grow sales and earnings in 2025. We are operating in a macroeconomic environment that may impact consumer demand. The guidance considers what the company is aware of today, but remains subject to market volatility, unexpected disruptions and other risks and uncertainties. We have generated significant free cash flow and improved our financial position with a cash balance over $1.2 billion, achieved our targeted leverage ratio and an investment-grade rating. With our strong balance sheet and consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we are announcing a new multiyear share repurchase program with an authorization of $1 billion. This action reflects confidence in our strategy to grow sales and earnings and cash flow and create long-term shareholder value. We intend to fund repurchases with free cash flow. In closing, we finished the year with a strong fourth quarter performance. For the year, we grew POS, gained market share and generated significant free cash flow. Looking ahead, we are launching a new cost savings program, expect to improve profitability in 2024, announced a new share repurchase program, and we'll continue to execute our strategy. And now I will turn it over to the operator."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from James Hardiman with Citi.', 'James Lloyd Hardiman', ""So I'm curious on the retail front. You talked about how retailers finished the year with absolute inventories and weeks on-hand down high single digits, but yet, it sounds like there's more work to be done. Maybe help us ideally quantify how much is left to go. What's the dollar value associated with that additional adjustment? And then, maybe just qualitatively, I mean, obviously, there was a significant headwind last year, particularly the first half of last year with similar inventory reductions. I guess, net-net, should we be thinking about sort of this wholesale versus retail dynamic is a net headwind or a net tailwind for the year? And I guess, specifically, that first half period."", 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""Sure. Let me address that. As we've discussed, we did -- ended the year 2023 with retail inventory elevated. And throughout the year, we worked with our retailers, and we've made significant progress. And as you pointed out, we ended the year with retail inventories down high single digits, both in dollars and weeks of supply. That being said, right, and although we made significant progress, the levels at the end of 2023 and going into 2024 are slightly elevated. But the way to think about 2024 is that the impact year-on-year, as we wrap the significant retail inventory reductions in 2023, it actually is a tailwind, right, to our top line performance in 2024. So hopefully, that helps."", 'James Lloyd Hardiman', 'It does. And I guess the keyword there is slightly elevated versus significantly elevated a year ago. Any idea, just ballpark, when we might get back to sort of a one-to-one relationship between wholesale and retail?', 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', 'Yes, we would expect to work through the situation together with our retailers in 2024. And I think in terms of the other part of your question around cadence, we did see a return to more historical patterns in terms of first half, second half gross billings, 2/3 in the second half, 1/3 in the first half, and we would expect that to generally continue in terms of the cadence into 2024.', 'Operator', 'And we will take our next question from Eric Handler with ROTH MKM.', 'Eric Owen Handler', ""Wondering if you could talk a little bit about Hot Wheels and sort of some of the growth that you're expecting from the segment in 2024. And sort of what's allowed that just to maintain such a strong growth cadence over the last 5 or 6 years?"", 'Ynon Kreiz', ""Yes, Eric. So vehicles continue a very strong performance. It was up 15% in the quarter, 11% for the year, and POS was in line with that. We gained 280 basis points of market share. This is a very meaningful increase in our position. Hot Wheels within that grew 16% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year. And as we noted on the call, we achieved our sixth consecutive record year. And again, #1 in the Vehicles -- in the Vehicle category as a whole. The growth was driven primarily by die-cast vehicles and new innovation, including the RC, for example, the skate segment and new launches of Hot Wheels RacerVerse in the fall. And we've continued to introduce new ways to play and engage with the brand. We also look to continue to leverage the core die-cast vehicle, serving both children and adult collectors. There's more content that will come out this year on Netflix. And the success in our Vehicle category in general, and Hot Wheels specifically, really goes back to our playbook and how we're leveraging the strength of the brand, infusing innovation into the product and continuing to add more touch points for the consumers. And there's a movie currently in development with J.J. Abrams as a producer at Warner Bros. So we will continue to drive and elevate this incredible franchise, which has so much of a runway and opportunities ahead of it.Within the Vehicles category, just to say, Matchbox also performed well. Disney Pixar Cars continue to show that it's an evergreen brand under our management, with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. And all in all, we're in a great place and expect to continue to see growth in '24 and beyond."", 'Eric Owen Handler', ""Great. And then, Anthony, just a quick question on free cash flow. So you're expecting about $200 million of lower free cash flow in 2024. EBITDA is expected to grow. Is there some type of working capital issue that's sort of causing the lower free cash flow number? Or maybe you could walk us through that."", 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""Sure. I wouldn't call it an issue per se. I think the way to look at it is, it was outstanding performance in 2023, over $700 million of free cash flow at 75% conversion from EBITDA. And the key driver of that is, I would say, an outsized reduction in our inventory levels, right? So we've been working on this for quite some time and have seen sequential improvements over, I would say, the last 6 quarters. And ended the year with inventories down $322 million or 36%, and that's having a significant impact on our free cash flow performance in 2023. In terms of 2024, I would characterize the $500 million as a strong, well, cash flow and about a 50% EBITDA conversion based on the midpoint of the guidance. So we feel good about 2023, especially, and we feel good about the expected level in 2024."", 'Operator', 'And we will take our next question from Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.', 'Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser', 'I was wondering if you could give us some more information on the cadence of the $200 million of cost savings over the next few years. Is it weighted more toward one year or another? And then how much in cost savings are you figuring into your guidance for 2024?', 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', 'Sure. To answer the last part, first, Linda, we expect about $60 million of savings from the program in 2024. I would say, in terms of cadence, I would think kind of an even distribution over the next 3 years. So as we talked, targeting $200 million by the third year, again, coming equally. And in terms of P&L distribution, about 70% coming out of cost of goods sold and 30% out of SG&A.', 'Linda Ann Bolton-Weiser', ""Okay. And then, can you comment -- I mean there's been some commentary made out there about the fact that you should do something more dramatic with your Fisher-Price business and American Girl. And now you're announcing that American Girl will sort of be integrated. Maybe you can just explain what are the benefits of integrating that American Girl into the North American organization. And then also, I mean, I do think that American Girl has had some trouble in general with growth in the last couple of years. So it seems to me that doing something with that business is more of a stand-alone -- I kind of don't think you're going to get rid of Fisher-Price. That would just be my guess, but maybe you could just comment on these businesses."", 'Ynon Kreiz', ""Thank you, Linda. Without commenting specifically about any one brand, we believe we have a very strong portfolio. We always evaluate our portfolio to position the company for growth, in line with our strategy to create long-term shareholder value. And you obviously assume that whatever we announced today has been in play for a while, and these are things that we take our time to consider and analyze. As it relates to American Girl, it's a valued asset within our portfolio, with significant -- a significant fan base and a really, really good product. We continue to progress our strategy to optimize the retail footprint and consumer omnichannel experience. We saw improvement in sales trends in the fourth quarter. We opened a new L.A. flagship store, and all 3 flagship stores achieved same-store sales growth for the year.We recently announced the American Girl movie in partnership with Paramount, and just announced today our latest collaboration with Disney Princess and Frozen. So the brand is very much thriving with a lot of activity. And the -- moving American Girl to be part of the commercial organization is about helping us leverage our direct-to-consumer capabilities and drive demand, as we did so well with Mattel Creations. We think the issue -- the product is great. We're looking to strengthen the commercial model and believe that within our -- within our North America organization, we have very strong capabilities as it relates to the direct to consumer. We are very confident in the long-term value of American Girl and continue to always evaluate our portfolio and position the company for long-term growth."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Arpine Kocharyan with UBS.', 'Arpine Kocharyan', 'I apologize. You mentioned M&A as a potential use of capital. Could you just comment what would that look like for you in terms of criteria for acquisition? If you could just update us what those criteria would look like, that would be great.', 'Ynon Kreiz', ""Yes, Arpine, and thank you. We talked about our M&A approach before. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we are going to, first of all, when it comes to deploying capital, first of all, it's about organic growth and maintaining our investment-grade rating with a leverage ratio between 2x and 2.5x debt to adjusted EBITDA. Now with our strong balance sheet and significant cash balance, we have the flexibility to look at more opportunities to grow the business, and this is M&A and share repurchases. As it relates to M&A, the criteria is going to look for opportunities that are strategic, that are accretive, that will help us improve our growth profile and create economic value for our shareholders. And the terminology we used in the past, the way we said is that we are looking to do things that will be obvious to our investors. We're going to be smart, methodical. We worked very hard to put the company on a very strong financial footing as we are today. And we will make sure that we will not change that if we do an M&A or pursue external opportunities for growth."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Jim Chartier with Monness, Crespi, Hardt.', 'James Andrew Chartier', 'Anthony, the deflation is a big driver of gross margin in fourth quarter. Can you just kind of walk through the drivers of that? And then how does that play into the gross margin outlook for 2024?', 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""Sure. As you saw in our bridge, we increased gross margin 570 basis points in the fourth quarter and 340 of that was deflation. So we did see deflation in both logistics, primarily ocean freight, as well as on our resin cost, and that's coming through in the P&L in the fourth quarter. I mean, together with lower inventory management costs and cost savings and favorable mix, we feel really good about where we ended on gross margin. As I look to the full year, right, inflation was a slight benefit, primarily driven again by ocean freight and resin.And as we turn to 2024, we do expect 100 to 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. And the two primary drivers are actually savings from our Optimizing for Profitable Growth Program as well as fixed cost absorption benefits as we resume normal production levels following the pullback in 2023. And those will be partly offset as we wrap some of the Barbie movie-related benefits. We don't expect inflation/deflation to have a material impact in 2024. Although we do expect to see favorability in ocean freight, we do see a headwind on wages and salaries within our cost of goods sold line. And then in terms of phasing, probably some deflation in the first half and that reversing in the second half."", 'James Andrew Chartier', 'And then you highlighted Mattel163 growth in the year. Could you just kind of walk through that business, what is kind of the growth going forward for that business? And then I noticed that the equity income line was actually down for the quarter and year despite the revenues growing for that business. So just curious why the profitability is lower?', 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', 'Yes. So we have been very successful with our Mattel163 business. Sales grew to almost $200 million in 2023 inside of the joint venture with -- behind the success between UNO, Phase 10 and Skip-Bo. The reason on the P&L that our earnings from equity affiliates is down slightly is that we are making investments in that business, both marketing current games and development costs around innovating around future games.', 'Operator', 'And we will take our next question from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.', 'Stephen Neild Laszczyk', ""For Ynon or maybe Anthony, on Barbie, could you perhaps impact some of the underlying assumptions in your outlook for the brand in '24? I think you mentioned that you expect sales to be down year-over-year. I appreciate that there is the $150 million revenue hard comp from the movie last year. But maybe adjusting for that, to what degree do you expect to see any sustained momentum from the brand in 2024?"", 'Ynon Kreiz', ""Yes. Stephen, the Barbie had a very strong finish for the year, with the fourth quarter growing 24%, and this was across the brand, toys and the benefits associated with the movie. The movie continue to play very well. It was a cultural phenomenon. It lifted the brand. It brought in the audience. And it played well also with adults, and especially with collectors. Within that, the Barbie Dreamhouse had an excellent year as well. And Barbie, as a whole, continued to gain share and perform very strongly. A lot of it was due -- was related to the movie. It was the benefit of the movie, but not only. It's just the strength and the cultural resonance of the brand. And we did a lot of work around that to make sure we capture the moment and build on that.In '24, we will be celebrating Barbie's 65th anniversary, with a lot of activations around that and more product that will celebrate the brand's past and future. We are looking to leverage the broader audience to launch new products, especially for adult collectors, and trying to reach and engage pop culture fans and also reach all the kids and brought in the audience after the movie's success. We also expect to see shelf space expansion in the second half and more customized product line that we will support with a unique system of play that we will talk more about in our March investor presentation. And separately from that, there will also be content on Netflix that will continue to play -- offer the drumbeat of the content engagement with fans around the brand."", 'Operator', 'And we will take our next question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.', 'Christopher Michael Horvers', ""So as you think about -- I have 2 questions. So first, as you think about like the excess inventory that is in the market, can you talk about where you're seeing that in terms of what categories? And then as a follow-up, as you think about the prospect for your cost deflating, do retailers typically try to go and recapture some of that in terms of better pricing or better margins? And is it your expectation that are you planning for these current freight rates to sort of stay intact at these levels into the back half of the year?"", 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""Yes. As it comes to the retail inventory levels, as we said, they are slightly elevated. I think slightly is the key word there, and I can't point you to any specific category or any geographic region where we have the issue. It's not that significant. As we said, we made significant headways in bringing down retail inventory levels in 2023. And in fact, as we wrap it, it's going to be a tailwind in 2024. As it relates to your other question, if you go back in time, we have experienced significant cost inflation over the last several years. And it isn't until the second half of 2023 that we actually saw some deflation come through. And so in terms of working with our retailers, we will manage the situation accordingly. We don't plan for any broad-based pricing changes in 2024, and again, work closely with our retailers on this front."", 'Christopher Michael Horvers', ""Got it. And then just in terms of the -- how you're planning for freight rates. Obviously, there's a lot of noise in the world, and ocean freight rates are up globally, not like they were, certainly, in 2021. But I guess, how are you planning for freight rates? And is that -- are you expecting them to remain elevated through the back half of the year when a lot of the shipments start churning through? Or how do you manage that sort of contracting versus spot process?"", 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""Yes. This is a situation, obviously, we're monitoring very closely. I would say, to date, it has not had a material impact. And we've made some assumptions around ocean freight declining in 2024 versus 2023. But like I said, we'll continue to watch what's happening."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Megan Alexander with Morgan Stanley.', 'Megan Christine Alexander', ""I wanted to go back to James' question at the beginning and just your comments on lapping the destock being a tailwind this year. You're guiding to flat sales. You quantified $125 million of Barbie-related movie sales. So if you have to kind of -- if we assume you give that back this year, that more or less implies underlying, call it, low single-digit sales growth. You're talking POS expectation, I think, is flat. So is that, call it, 2% benefit the tailwind from lapping the destocking? And just from a timing perspective, you're saying we're back to more historical shipping patterns, the -- but retailer inventory is slightly elevated. So do we see that 2 points in the first half, just given the lap? Or is it more of a back-half opportunity?"", 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""Yes. So let me try to unpack the top line guidance a bit for 2024. As we said, comparable in constant currency. And from a category perspective, Vehicles, up; Infant, Toddler, Preschool and Challenger categories, flat; and Dolls, down. The other way to look at it is in the context here, as Ynon said, we do expect the industry to decline, but not to the extent it did in 2023. Against that backdrop, we expect our POS to be flat, which implies significant and continuing share gains. And then there's a plus and a minus, right? The plus is, we're going to wrap the inventory reduction in 2023. That's a tailwind to 2024, but that's being offset by the wrap related to the benefits associated with the Barbie movie. So there's several pluses and minuses in there, and hopefully, that helps, Megan."", 'Megan Christine Alexander', 'Okay. I guess, just anything on the timing, we know that $125 million was more so the third quarter. I guess, just your sales were down significantly in the first half of last year. So is it -- but you said more normal. So is it flat over the year? I guess, like is it -- can you help us a little bit on timing?', 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""Yes, sure. I think in the context of our $5 billion of sales, as I said earlier, we do expect kind of a return to historical patterns in terms of shipments. So we don't really see any material change in the cadence between 2023 and 2024."", 'Megan Christine Alexander', ""Okay. And then I think just on the cost savings. I think you said 70% kind of in cost of goods. Can you help us unpack maybe how much of that just this year is related to the closing of the China manufacturing plan? And then maybe can you just spend some time expanding on the other things you're doing that's driving the $200 million of savings. I guess you've taken out a lot of costs over the last couple of years. So I'm just trying to understand maybe how much is pure cost takeout versus maybe more productivity-type efficiencies."", 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""Yes. Sure. As you suggested, look, we have a strong track record of identifying and executing against our cost savings commitments. And as we announced today, we're launching this Optimizing for Profitable Growth Program. It's a combination of looking for and achieving efficiencies, which really leveraged our global scale, as well as cost-saving opportunities within our supply chain, including our manufacturing footprint. So we did talk about taking out one of our China plants. That's not going to impact 2024, that's more later, given the time horizon. But we have a number of productivity initiatives planned for our supply chain as well as optimizing our geographic sourcing on product, which is going to help in 2024. So we expect about $60 million total from the program in 2024. Again, a combination of cost of goods sold and SG&A, and very confident in our ability to achieve that."", 'Operator', 'We will take our final question from Drew Crum with Stifel.', 'Andrew Edward Crum', ""Ynon, a couple of years ago, you suggested that Dolls would be the fastest or one of the fastest-growing segments of the toy industry on a global basis. As you enter a new year, what is your updated view on the category and Mattel's positioning? Any catalysts on the horizon we can look forward to as it relates to your business? And then I have a follow-up."", 'Ynon Kreiz', ""Yes, thanks, Drew. Yes, we couldn't be happier with our performance in the Dolls category. And we're going to have a lot more to share with you at our Investor Day. There's a pretty deep analysis, a lot of exciting innovation, and we'll break it down by each of our key brands. We do expect -- just to give you a bit of a preview, we do expect the category to be down in 2024. But over time, it's a healthy category. It's competitive. It's driven by innovation. And within that, we expect to continue to gain share, with a very strong portfolio of some of the strongest brands in the industry that we are managing with -- as part of our portfolio strategy, with each of our key brands having its own lane, with its own clear purpose and methodology. And Lisa McKnight, our Chief Brand Officer, will talk about that in more detail at our presentation in March."", 'Andrew Edward Crum', 'Okay. Perfect. And then maybe for Anthony, can you remind us what percentage of manufacturing is sourced from China, I guess, before and after the closure of the plant?', 'Anthony P. DiSilvestro', ""I'm sorry, Drew. I'm going to answer that one again, in case we were on mute. So the question was, what's the percent of product out of China? We're at about 50%, plus or minus. We have a very diversified manufacturing footprint, both on our own facilities as well as third-party. And once we close that plant in China, that will come down a bit from there going forward."", 'Operator', 'And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Chairman and CEO, Mr. Ynon Kreiz, for closing remarks.', 'Ynon Kreiz', ""Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your questions today. In conclusion, this was a very strong fourth quarter for the company, with double-digit growth, both at the top line and bottom line, and continued margin expansion. We ended the year with the strongest balance sheet we've had in years, putting us in an excellent position to continue to execute our strategy. As we look to 2024, we believe we are very well positioned competitively, and we'll continue to outpace the industry and gain market share. And we talked today about 2 important programs that we put in place for the -- one is for the $1 billion of share repurchase and the other one is the Optimizing for Profitable Growth Program of $200 million savings over the next 3 years.So we look forward to discussing more about our strategy and our road map for the year and beyond at our investor presentation in March. So please look out for more details about that. We'll have a lot more to share with you then. And now I'll turn the call back over to Dave."", 'David Zbojniewicz', ""Thank you, Ynon, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) saw a big 10.7% jump in share price. The company's financials reflected the positive impact of its recent endeavours taken to boost growth after the pandemic-driven spurt died down and as competition heats up. This marks a good start to 2024 for the stock, which is up 16% for the year so far."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with T.', 'While full-year revenue growth at 6.70% was only a tad higher than the 6.50% for 2022, the figure for the final quarter of the year was notable. It came in at 12.50% year over year, compared to the expectation of a 10.7% increase. That the company forecast revenues to grow in double digits for the first time in two years was notable enough, but that it came in even better than expected makes it all the more significant.', ""The company's full-year operating margins came in at 20.60%, slightly outdoing the company's upwardly revised expectation of 20%, which was at the top end of its earlier guidance range of 18% to 20%. The figure was also higher compared to the 17.80% margin in 2022."", 'The operating income margin also rose to 16.60% in the fourth quarter, outstripping the projection of 13.30% as revenue was better than expected and planned spending was lower as well. The results were supported by a 12.80% increase in global streaming paid memberships.', ""However, the net income did not do as well, coming in 1.90% lower than the forecasts. As a result, the diluted earnings per share came in at $2.11 compared to the expectation of $2.15. However, the number is still higher by 17.60 times than last year's figure, which was particularly low due to unfavourable exchange rates. As a result of several quarters of earnings improvements, the full-year figure showed a 21% rise to $12."", 'Netflix expects the healthy performance to continue. Notably, it projects revenue growth to jump to double digits again for full-year 2024 on a neutral exchange rate basis, after seeing single-digit growth in the past two years. The operating margin is expected to increase by 24%, an upgrade from the 22% to 23% increase seen earlier.', 'This uptick in the forecast is expected to be seen from the first quarter of 2024 onwards (see table above for details of the forecast), with the most striking feature being the jump in operating margin to 26.20%, which is higher than even the full-year forecast.', ""The improved performance and forecasts follow the company's strategic changes that included the introduction of advertisement-based memberships at lower prices, increased charges for regular subscribers and the discouragement of password sharing."", 'Ad-based memberships have been quite successful, with 70% sequential growth in the fourth quarter. In fact, these memberships are 40% of Netflix signups in its ads markets now, leading the company to plan retiring the basic plan in some of its ad markets like the U.K. and Canada in the second quarter of 2024.', 'Further, while Netflix continues to be the leader in streaming across a number of markets (see chart above), it also plans to expand its offerings to the likes of live games. This is not just as competition increases in streaming services, but also due to divided consumer time for entertainment because of social media channels like Instagram and TikTok.', ""While the latest numbers and the expansion in offerings bode well for the company, the question now is what they mean for the stock. To get a sense of Netflix's forward price-earnings ratio for 2024, I made estimates of its earnings per share for the year."", ""The full-year revenue is assumed to grow at 12.50%, the same as in the fourth quarter of 2023 and in line with the company's forecast of double-digit expansion. Although it expects the operating margin to be higher, which can also spill into the net margin, here I have conservatively assumed the net margin will stay static at 2023's level of 16%."", ""If the weighted average common shares outstanding stay the same as in 2023, the earnings per share come in at $13.50, which is a 12.5% increase over last year and results in a forward earnings multiple of 41.70 times. This is below the average of the past five years' year-end forward price-earnings ratio of 45.40. This means Netflix's stock still has upside."", 'All in all, Netflix had a good 2023. The uptick in revenue in the fourth quarter is particularly encouraging and on a full-year basis, the operating margin looks good too. In 2024, the company expects to see continued revenue growth and expanding margins, supported by its strategic actions and improved offerings, which is encouraging for the stock going forward. Its forward price-earnings ratio also gives a reason to expect a price upside for the stock.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Boasting over 260 million paid members, the streaming giant keeps posting robust growth in revenues and earnings despite the industry suffering from oversaturation. In fact, improved profitability has enabled management to return significant capital to shareholders, boosting the stock’s appeal. I believe this trend is set to be sustained. Thus, I am bullish on NFLX stock.', 'Netflix continues to astound with its remarkable ability to consistently attract paid subscribers, even with the fierce competition in the saturated streaming and social media landscape. In an era where tech and media giants fight for consumers’ attention, the company’s sustained subscriber growth is nothing short of astonishing.', 'Think about this for a minute. The streaming and social media space is more saturated than ever, with numerous players battling for viewers’ precious watch time. Initially, Netflix dominated the space, primarily facing off against outdated cable networks. However, the dynamics have shifted, and Netflix now contends with a multitude of streaming services, including Disney’s (NYSE:DIS) Disney+, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video Service, AT&T’s (NYSE:T) HBO, Hulu, Peacock, and various smaller players.', 'Moreover, Netflix faces competition in the “attention economy” from tech giants like Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL), YouTube, TikTok, and Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) Reels. They all strive to capture market share in viewership to increase their advertising revenues. In fact, TikTok’s and Reels’ focus on promoting both short-form and long-form views and even producing shows on their own is proof of their competition with Netflix.', 'Despite these challenges, Netflix maintains a robust subscriber base, and its paid subscriber growth has even accelerated in recent quarters, including in its latest Q4 results. To illustrate, here are Netflix’s quarterly paid subscriber growth rates over the past two years.', 'Q1 2022: 6.7%', 'Q2 2022: 5.5%', 'Q3 2022: 4.5%', 'Q4 2022: 4.0%', 'Q1 2023: 4.9%', 'Q2 2023: 8.0%', 'Q3 2023: 10.8%', 'Q4 2023: 12.8%', 'These figures vividly depict a moderation in paid subscriber acquisition throughout 2022, following the unprecedented surge in subscribers over the preceding two years. The widespread stay-at-home trend during the pandemic fueled remarkable growth in 2020 and 2021, with Netflix experiencing a remarkable 20%+ expansion in paid memberships during that period. Consequently, a deceleration in growth for the subsequent year, 2022, was predictable as the situation began to stabilize.', 'However, as conditions normalized, subscriber growth rebounded significantly in 2023, showcasing a notable uptick quarter-over-quarter. The most recent quarter’s growth of 12.8% is especially noteworthy, pushing Netflix’s paid subscriber base to a staggering 260.3 million.', 'Powered by an acceleration in subscriber growth, revenue growth has also followed a similar trend. The same goes for earnings, as margins have been on the rise, with the income statement benefiting from improving unit economics. In the meantime, Netflix’s outlook for the first quarter of 2024 suggests that this trend is set to persist.', 'To illustrate, Netflix posted record revenues of $8.54 billion in Q4, a year-over-year increase of 12.5%. As you can see in the table below, revenue growth has also accelerated, in line with subscriber growth. Notably, this increase was the best for the company since Q4-2021’s growth rate of 16%. Simultaneously, NFLX’s operating margin jumped to 16.9%, notably higher than last year’s 7.0%. This combo allowed net income and EPS to skyrocket to $938 million.', 'Noteworthy is also the fact that Netflix’s share count declined by 1.6% to 444.3 million, with management deploying just over $6.0 billion in buybacks in Fiscal 2023. While not a massive drop, management’s clear intention to boost buybacks should translate to a gradually accretive effect on earnings per share, which is welcomed.', 'But besides closing the year on a high note, investors were left particularly impressed with management’s Q1-2024 outlook, which points to further acceleration in revenues and a significant expansion operating income margin expansion. In particular, revenues are expected to grow by 13.2%, while operating income margin is expected to reach 26.2%, implying a notable expansion from last year’s 21% and last quarter’s 16.9%.', 'Regarding Wall Street’s view on Netflix, the stock has drawn a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, 13 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $574.01, the\xa0average Netflix stock forecast\xa0implies 2.6% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell NFLX stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Jason Helfstein\xa0from Oppenheimer, with an average return of 43.42% per rating and a 100% success rate.

Prospective viewers, take note: the series is a tearjerker.', 'It’s St. Swithin’s Day in each episode of the 14-part Netflix series, a new adaptation of David Nicholls’ romance novel.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit\xa0Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.', ""Global financial markets experienced a moment of pause on February 6 as traders awaited further guidance from central bank officials, particularly from the Federal Reserve. The bond market, in particular, showed signs of stabilization following a significant sell-off spanning two days, which was the most pronounced in months. Meanwhile, the direction of stocks remained uncertain amid a mixed bag of corporate earnings reports. In the bond market, there was a modest recovery as ten-year Treasury yields, which had surged approximately 28 basis points over the preceding two sessions, registered minor fluctuations. S&P 500 futures indicated a slight decline, while European stocks saw marginal gains. Notably, BP Plc enjoyed a notable surge of nearly 7% after unveiling plans to initiate a substantial buyback program, amounting to $3.5 billion in the first half of the year. However, the positive momentum from BP's announcement was offset by disappointing earnings results from UBS Group AG, leading to a retreat in its stock price. This contrast in performance underscores the delicate balance in the current market environment, where investors are weighing various factors, including corporate performance, central bank policies, and geopolitical developments, to determine their next moves. Chinese stocks rallied sharply on Tuesday, marking their most significant single-day surge in two years, buoyed by signals of increased government support, reported Reuters. The Shanghai Composite index rose 3.2%, its largest daily gain since March 2022, with trade volume hitting its highest level in months. The blue-chip CSI 300 index also climbed 3.5%, while the small-cap index saw its most substantial rise since 2008. The rebound comes after the indexes hit five-year lows recently due to concerns about the economy and lack of policy stimulus. Positive news, including reports of President Xi Jinping's engagement with financial regulators and further restrictions on short selling, contributed to the market's renewed optimism. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index surged 4%, with technology stocks leading the gains. While state intervention has bolstered market sentiment in the short term, underlying economic challenges like weak demand and deflationary pressures remain. The market's reaction underscores the need for sustained efforts to address these structural issues for long-term stability and growth. From the Oil market front, oil prices rose as concerns about escalating tensions in the Middle East offset the impact of hawkish remarks from the Federal Reserve. Brent crude remained above $78 per barrel following a rebound from a recent low. The United States indicated plans for further military action against Iranian forces and their allies in the region, while Yemen's Houthi rebels reported another attack on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. These geopolitical developments countered initial market pessimism earlier in the week, as investors downplayed the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in March, keeping oil prices within a narrow range of around $10 throughout the year so far. In financial markets, notable equities such as Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) and GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) have received downgrades from analysts among many other companies.

(NYSE:MKL) from Buy to Hold and adjusted the price target from $1,680 to $1,500. Despite the downgrade, the stock experienced a marginal increase of 0.43% in its market price by the closing bell, reaching $1,418.80. According to Andersen, Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL) is facing heightened pressure on its commercial liability reserves, which is expected to persist in the foreseeable future. This pressure is attributed to sustained levels of social and financial inflation, which are impacting the company's loss cost trends. Additionally, the analyst expressed concerns regarding Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL) heavy reliance on favorable reserve offsets, particularly from recent accident years, international operations, and short-tail lines, to counterbalance adverse trends in its U.S. long-tail business. The decision to downgrade Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL) reflects Jefferies' apprehension about the company's ability to mitigate the challenges posed by the current operating environment effectively. Despite the company's strong fundamentals and past performance, the analyst believes that the prevailing market conditions warrant a more cautious stance. The revised price target of $1,500 indicates a tempered outlook for Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL) valuation, aligning with the concerns raised regarding its reserve pressures and loss cost trends. Overall, Jefferies' downgrade underscores the importance of closely monitoring the evolving dynamics within the insurance industry, particularly concerning reserve management and the impact of inflationary pressures."", 'Giverny Capital Asset Management stated the following regarding Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“In the fourth quarter, we sold\xa0Markel Group Inc.\xa0(NYSE:MKL), the Richmond-based insurer. For some years now, Markel has tried to mimic Berkshire Hathaway by using profit generated in its core insurance business to buy whole companies. While this has been a compelling model for Berkshire, Markel has not been able to convince high-quality companies to sell for attractive prices to the same degree as Berkshire.', 'Meanwhile, in its insurance operations, Markel has an elevated expense structure – it spends about 33 cents of every dollar collected in premiums on its own overhead. Its leanest competitor spends 21 cents of every premium dollar on overhead. Markel’s cost structure stems from an unwieldy technology stack that would be very expensive to upgrade. I have great respect for Markel, but the combination of middling investments and a challenging expense structure caused me to believe I could find better value elsewhere.', 'Selling SS&C and Markel, which were each about 4% of the portfolio, was not easy for me. Both businesses trade for reasonable prices and have good competitive positions. They have strong CEOs who have been in the job for many years. CEO Bill Stone founded SS&C and is a billionaire thanks to his own decisions.

According to the analyst, TJX operates in the off-price retail industry, which continues to gain market share from traditional retail segments. While acknowledging The TJX Companies, Inc.

The firm believes that these expectations are overly optimistic, especially considering The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) strong operational performance compared to its peers. Redburn Atlantic cited concerns about the potential for a moderation in management's outlook, which could limit the stock's upside potential in the short term. Despite TJX's strong fundamentals and its success in the off-price retail market, the analyst believes that a more tempered approach to expectations is warranted given the prevailing market conditions. The decision to downgrade The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) reflects Redburn Atlantic's caution about the company's near-term outlook and its ability to sustain its current level of outperformance. While the firm remains positive about The TJX Companies, Inc.

We also see room for TJX to modestly expand margins on the back of sales leverage and as freight, shrink and wage pressures ease.

The amusement park industry, represented by Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (NYSE:SIX), faced regulatory uncertainties related to the proposed merger with Cedar Fair. Eric Wold highlighted ongoing concerns regarding the regulatory approval process for the merger as a key factor behind the downgrade. Wold emphasized the potential risks associated with the merger and its impact on Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (NYSE:SIX) future prospects. While acknowledging the company's strengths and previous recommendation to buy its stock, the analyst reassessed the situation in light of the regulatory challenges posed by the merger. Despite maintaining a positive outlook on Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (NYSE:SIX) fundamentals and its position in the amusement park industry, Wold believes that the uncertainties surrounding the merger warrant a more cautious approach.

To sustain growth, Dumoulin-Smith suggested an annual equity issuance of around $250 million, representing 2%-3% of average volume and 6% of market cap. He highlighted investor concerns about wildfire risk, which contribute to a discount in POR's valuation, especially among utility-focused and generalist investors. These adjustments led BofA Securities to revise its recommendation on Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) from Buy to Neutral. The decision to downgrade Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) was based on a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial metrics, industry dynamics, and regulatory environment. Dumoulin-Smith emphasized the importance of aligning the investment recommendation with the latest market conditions and outlook for the utility sector.

Last year, we delivered double-digit volume growth in all four quarters with balanced growth across products and geographies. 18 [ph] of our medicines generated record annual sales, including Repatha, Prolia EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA. The acquisition of Horizon, which is completed on October 6, gives us a significant new rare disease business that now stands as a fourth pillar of growth alongside our leading general medicine, oncology and inflammation businesses.', ""The medicines we acquired are all very early in their life cycles and by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics manufacturing, decades of experience in inflammation and our extensive global presence, we believe these products have the potential to reach many more patients around the world. Last year, we also advanced the deepest and most diverse pipeline in our history with promising molecules at all stages of development across our four pillars of growth. We anticipate well over a dozen significant pipeline milestones this year. I'll touch on a few. In General Medicine, we'll generate Phase II data this year for our lead obesity molecule, MariTide, and we're excited, of course, to learn more about this asset. We're also advancing a number of early-stage assets in this space."", ""In Oncology, we have a June 12 PDUFA date for the FDA to complete its priority review of Tarlatamab as a third-line treatment for small cell lung cancer. Tarlatamab is the first bispecific T cell engager shown to be effective in addressing a major solid tumor. In this case, one for which there has been no new treatment in decades and which today has a 5-year survival rate of just 3%. We're studying Tarlatamab in earlier lines of treatment and hope over the fullness of time to be able to serve the tens of thousands of patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer each year in the U.S. and major markets around the world. We've done this very successfully now with our first BiTE BLINCYTO, which has steadily moved into earlier lines of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and we'll take the same approach with yet another promising BiTE at being Xaluritamig in prostate cancer."", ""In inflammation, we'll have Phase III data from Rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis from the first of 1 are now 8 trials in the ROCKE program. And in rare disease, we'll have Phase III data for UPLIZNA and myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease. At a time when a rapidly aging global population needs more innovation, Amgen is delivering, both with the medicines we have in the market today and with the promising new medicines that are advancing in our pipeline. We're also excited by the rapid convergence of biotech and tech, which is enabling us to innovate more quickly and confidently. We've been preparing for this hinge moment for more than a decade and recently named Dave Reese as our first ever Chief Technology Officer to ensure that we're capitalizing on technologies like generative artificial intelligence, not just in R&D, but across the entire company."", ""Succeeding Dave is Amgen's Head of R&D is Jay Bradner. Jay is a physician scientist and a seasoned R&D leader, having served for many years as President of the Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research. Jay previously also served as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and prior to joining Amgen was a practicing oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We're delighted to have Jay on board and excited by the work that he Dave and the rest of our team will do together to accelerate innovation at Amgen for the good of patients and for the long-term growth of our business. And with that, I want to thank our 27,000 employees around the world for their many contributions to our success. And let me now ask Murdo to talk about our commercial performance in 2023."", ""Murdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob, and I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023. Execution was strong across the business, resulting in record sales in the year for 18 brands and robust volume growth across the four pillars of our business. Full year product sales increased 9% year-over-year. Volume growth was 15% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 14% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Canada region was 10%. Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest-growing region with 41% volume growth. These results include $954 million of sales from the legacy Horizon portfolio from the period of October 6 through December 31. I'll start with our General Medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia EVENITY and Aimovig."", 'Overall revenue for these four products grew 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year, driven by 18% and 20% volume growth, respectively. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter with volume growth of 35%, partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside of the U.S., we saw 25% volume growth with strength across our regions. In the U.S., volume growth of 48% was driven by a 66% increase in the number of new patients starting treatment. We saw a decline in net selling price in the U.S., primarily driven by new formulary coverage. We expect this additional coverage to lead to strong volume growth, which will more than offset declining net selling price. In addition, some payers have recently removed prior authorization for some patients, which will further ease their access to Repatha.', ""We remain committed to the urgent need to educate physicians and patients on the importance of LDL-C lowering to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In the U.S., we activated more than 20,000 new prescribing physicians in 2023 in both the primary care and cardiology settings. And while we're pleased with this progress, we'll continue to work tirelessly for the many, many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha. Transitioning to bone health, EVENITY had record sales of $318 million for the quarter, driven by 39% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In the U.S., only 6% of very high-risk patients with osteoporosis are treated with a bone builder, creating an urgent need for treatment with an effective therapy."", ""EVENITY is an important therapy to address this unmet need as it is the only bone builder that works with the body's natural ability to increase bone formation and also decrease bone resorption. We see strong growth potential for EVENITY and we'll continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure it reaches all the patients who need it. Prolia sales grew 12% year-over-year to a record $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 10% was supported by real-world evidence reaffirming Prolia superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at a high risk of fracture. Moving to our oncology business, which includes BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and XGEVA."", 'Sales of these six innovative products grew 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, with 3% volume growth. Full year sales grew 12% year-over-year, driven by 12% volume growth. BLINCYTO sales grew 47% year-over-year to a record $241 million for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 55% was supported by broad prescribing to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in frontline consolidation treatment. Long term, we see significant growth potential for BLINCYTO from utilization earlier in the front line as part of induction treatment. LUMAKRAS sales increased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 5% and KYPROLIS sales grew 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, both driven by volume growth.', 'Nplate sales decreased 18% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by volume decline related to timing of orders placed by the U.S. government, partially offset by volume growth across our regions. Full year sales increased 13%, primarily driven by volume growth, including U.S. government orders. Excluding U.S. government orders, Nplate sales grew 23% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Transitioning to our inflammation business. Otezla sales increased 2% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 3% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory levels and lower net selling price. Full year sales decreased 4% driven by lower net selling price and lower inventory levels, partially offset by 2% volume growth.', 'New patient starts for Otezla grew 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong execution and increased investment. Competitor free drug programs had a reduced impact in the quarter. Otezla is uniquely positioned to grow in 2024 and beyond, given its indication for all severities of psoriasis, combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation and convenient oral administration. Enbrel sales decreased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by a 4% impact from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. U.S. volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter, supported by an increase in new patients starting treatment as a result of improved payer coverage.', 'Going forward, we expect net selling price to continue to decline year-over-year driven by higher rebates to maintain broad first-line payer coverage and changes in patient mix. TEZSPIRE continues a strong launch trajectory with $177 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $567 million for the full year. Sales increased 10% sequentially, driven by volume growth. Our successful launch of a self-administered prefilled single-use pen allowed us to expand coverage with major pharmacy benefit managers to over 80%, contributing to higher new patient growth as the year progressed. Moving forward, we expect this expanded coverage will allow TEZSPIRE to help even more patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. Sales of TAVNEOS were $44 million in the quarter and $134 million for the full year.', 'In the fourth quarter, we saw a 17% quarter-over-quarter volume growth in the U.S. Approximately 2,700 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 1,700 health care professionals. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 10% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by 27% and 29% volume growth. This volume growth was partially offset by net selling price decline. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. Overall, our execution is strong across the business, underscored by our foundational commitment to serve patients.', ""The four pillars of our portfolio position us well to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio."", ""Vikram Karnani: Thanks, Murdo. I am glad to share an update on our rare disease business now that we are 4 months past due close. We are now fully operating as part of Amgen with integration activities ongoing. As Bob has mentioned before, we are excited to be Amgen's fourth pillar of long-term growth. I wanted to make sure you're aware that we are not reporting the full quarter in press release and slides, which reflects sales from October 6 onwards and totaled $954 million. This excludes $41 million of sales that occurred in the first week of October prior to deal close. For the full quarter, our rare disease brands from Horizon delivered product sales of $995 million, representing 6% year-over-year sales growth. Throughout the remainder of my remarks, I will reference full quarter product sales."", ""TEPEZZA, and IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for patients with thyroid eye disease generated $467 million of sales during the entire fourth quarter, representing 3% quarter-over-quarter growth. This is the third quarter in a row of quarter-over-quarter growth for TEPEZZA with the growth largely driven by the U.S. We saw a number of positive leading indicators, including a record number of unique TEPEZZA prescribers, total patient enrollment forms and patient starts in 2023. Additionally, thanks to our efforts, we've been able to generate favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives, and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. We continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate to severe disease in the U.S. who could benefit from TEPEZZA with the majority of these patients in low clinical activity score settings."", 'Given positive leading indicators and high unmet need, we see a long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA in the U.S., while also recognizing there is some time lag between our execution efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. International expansion also remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA. TEPEZZA is approved in Brazil, and we are progressing towards approval in additional countries. Our expansion into both Japan and Europe is a high priority with regulatory review underway in Japan and filings in the EU throughout the year. KRYSTEXXA, a PEGylated uricase enzyme for patients with chronic refractory gout delivered a record $280 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 30% year-over-year growth, driven by continued strong commercial execution.', ""Sales are now annualizing at $80 billion [ph] run rate. Performance was driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand generation, stakeholder engagement and adherence to treatment. UPLIZNA, an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody, which is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $70 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 68% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex U.S. markets. Our remaining ultra-rare portfolio generated $178 million of sales for the entire fourth quarter, primarily driven by our ultra-rare medicines, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE. Looking ahead at 2024 by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics capabilities, decades of experience in inflammation and extensive global presence, we are ready to reach more patients than ever before."", 'I will now turn it over to Jay.', ""Jay Bradner: Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take a minute to convey how thrilled I am to join the Amgen R&D organization and its leadership team. The creativity of our discovery research, expert and expedited clinical development, most authoritative biomanufacturing organization in the industry, all were well known to me before joining. But now on staff at Amgen, I appreciate the strong sense of service, the patients facing serious illness, the like-minded commitment, growing the impact of our medicines and our business and the shared conviction in this remarkable portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. In 2023, we executed with speed across our clinical pipeline, achieving excellent enrollment in key programs and setting up 2024 as the year with significant data readouts across the portfolio for medicines with the potential to transform patient care."", ""Key highlights in 2023 included the delivery of promising data from four key oncology assets and the attainment of three breakthrough therapy designations in oncology. We initiated pivotal Phase III studies for Tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer, LUMAKRAS in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, along with dazodalibep in Sjögren's syndrome. In General Medicine, as previously disclosed, top line 52-week data from the 592 patient MariTide Phase II study is expected by late 2024. Leveraging the durability of weight loss observed in Phase I and rapid enrollment enjoyed in Phase II, we recently added a part 2 to this study, which explores durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. Our planning for a comprehensive Phase III program across multiple indications remains on track."", ""Lastly, you may have seen that yesterday, Nature Metabolism published manuscript from Amgen R&D that provides the integration of MariTide preclinical and Phase I data. Beyond MariTide, our obesity strategy encompasses several assets with AMG 786 in Phase I and additional preclinical assets advancing. Our approach is tailored to meet the dynamic needs of obesity treatment, demonstrating a longitudinal commitment to innovation and patient care in this field. The Phase III outcome study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has enrolled more than 7,000 patients globally. This rapid enrollment accomplished in just 1 year across 34 countries and over 700 sites underscores the medical community's strong interest in and the potential impact of Olpasiran."", ""We've deliberately expanded our initial enrollment target from 6,000 to over 7,000 patients to ensure comprehensive demographic representation and to satisfy regional regulatory requirements. We are on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2024. In oncology, we're focused on approaching high conviction targets with differentiated therapies for large effect size. We're pleased to announce that the FDA granted priority review for BLINCYTO in early-stage CD19-positive B-ALL with a PDUFA date of June 21, 2024. The ongoing Phase III Golden Gate study is enrolling patients to evaluate the effectiveness of alternating BLINCYTO with low intensity chemotherapy here in older adults diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL. We're also planning to amend this study to evaluate subcutaneous administration of blinatumomab with initiation anticipated in the second half of 2024 potentially allowing us to serve more patients in treating physicians."", ""Lastly, we're pleased to announce that just today, the American Journal of Hematology published a manuscript highlighting data from the dose expansion phase of our ongoing Phase Ib study of subcutaneous blinatumomab as a single agent in adult patients with heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL. Of 27 evaluable patients treated, we observed an 85% complete response rate, of which 75% were MRD negative. Subcutaneous blinatumumab is well tolerated with no observed grade 4 cytokine release syndrome. Turning to Tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3-targeting BiTE molecule, the FDA granted priority review following promising results from the Phase II DeLLphi-301 clinical trial and a PDUFA date of June 12, 2024. We are rapidly advancing Tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment, where we have initiated two Phase III studies and plan to initiate a third in the first half of 2024."", ""Xaluritamig, a first-in-class STEAP1 bispecific molecule being studied in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer continues to progress following the presentation of encouraging Phase I data last fall. We are ahead of schedule with the monotherapy dose expansion and expect to complete enrollment in the coming weeks. We've opened a reduced monitoring cohort and are making significant progress in dose range finding studies in combination with novel hormonal therapy combinations. For AMG 193 in oral MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor were encouraged by 9 responses we've seen across 7 MTAP-null solid tumors. MG 193 is a terrific example of a medicine targeting a genetically defined synthetic lethality and a first clinical translation of our induced proximity platform."", ""We're now swiftly moving forward with dose expansion studies and plan to enter master protocols and thoracic and gastrointestinal malignancies, exploring combinations with standard of care in the first half of 2024. In our inflammation portfolio, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE and indications beyond severe asthma, including separate Phase III studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected in the second half of 2024 as well as in eosinophilic esophagitis. We also remain on track to present Phase II COPD data in the first half of 2024. Our ROCKET Phase III program for rocatinlimab, the first-in-class anti- OX40 -mon colonal antibody has successfully enrolled over 2,400 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis."", ""We're introducing an 8th study to the ROKET program to explore an auto-injector, and we are planning to initiate both the Phase III study in prurigo nodularis and a Phase II study in asthma this year as we seek to broadly explore the potential of rocatinlimab. Lastly, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid to late-stage opportunities. In December, TEPEZZA received orphan drug designation in Japan where we've also recently submitted a new drug application for TEPEZZA in thyroid eye disease. To serve additional patients in Japan, we have a Phase III study underway in the study of chronic disease with a low clinical activity score. Beyond Japan, we are progressing TEPEZZA subcutaneous administration to drive increased adoption and improve patient experience and plan to initiate a Phase III study in thyroid eye disease this year."", ""With UPLIZNA, we anticipate important Phase III data readouts this year in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease. Both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients. Dazodalibep, an innovative CD40-ligand inhibitor fusion protein has entered Phase III for Sjögren's syndrome. This follows encouraging Phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden. Dazodalibep is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in this latter patient population. Closing on our rare disease efforts, we're excited about Fipaxalparant, an LPAR1 antagonist being studied in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, on track for a Phase II proof-of-concept data readout in the second half of 2024."", ""In closing, I'm delighted to report on the important progress we make advancing our innovative pipeline, and I'm looking forward to sharing more pipeline milestones through 2024. I'll now turn it over to you, Peter."", ""Peter Griffith: Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023. In the fourth quarter, total revenue of $8.2 billion grew 20% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 grew 15% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered total revenue of $28.2 billion, 7% growth year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $18.65, 5% growth year-over-year. As a reminder, both Q4 and the full year results include Horizon's results beginning October 6 when the acquisition closed. So our financial results will exclude approximately 1 week of Horizon's results from our fourth quarter results. I'll review the details of our fourth quarter and full year financial results before discussing our outlook for 2024."", ""The financial results are shown on Slides 54 to 56 of the slide deck. Turning to our fourth quarter's total revenue of $8.2 billion. We saw product sales increased 20% year-over-year, driven by volume growth of 23%, offset by net selling price decline of 3%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, product sales increased 5% year-over-year driven by volume growth of 9%. Full year total revenues of $28.2 billion grew 7% year-over-year. Product sales increased 9% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth. Other revenues decreased 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly in 2022. Strong expense discipline resulted in a 50% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales for the full year 2023."", 'While we continue to focus on both internal and external innovation, investing $4.7 billion in our pipeline and $27.8 billion in our acquisition of Horizon. With product sales volume growth at 23% in Q4 and 15% for the full year, we still efficiently manage the operating expenses of the business. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 18% year-over-year, while full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% and full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 5%. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was flat on a year-over-year basis at 16.3%. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased by 1.1 percentage points to 17.0%.', 'The full year increase was primarily driven by higher profit share and changes in our product mix, partially offset by the replacement of the Puerto Rico excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the fourth quarter increased 16% year-over-year and 8% year-over-year for the full year primarily due to higher spend on later-stage clinical program and marketed product support, including spend on programs acquired from the Horizon acquisition and continuing investment in our pipeline, including MariTide. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 20% year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by a decline in other marketed product spend.', 'Non-GAAP OI&E were about $635 million in expense in the fourth quarter, a $168 million increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased interest expense related to the debt issued for the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP OI&E was favorable $279 million year-over-year, primarily driven by the change in accounting for the BeiGene investment to the fair value mark-to-market method and by gains related to early debt retirement, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Our non-GAAP tax rate increased 2.5 percentage points year-over-year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter and 2.7 percentage points year-over-year to 16.5% for the full year primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change mentioned previously. The company generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow in 2023 compared with $8.8 billion in 2022.', ""The decrease is driven by the Horizon transaction and integration costs, higher repatriation tax payments and higher capital expenditures. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows with the addition of Horizon and are on track with our deleveraging plans to return to our efficient capital structure by the end of 2025. In summary, we continue to execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation. Our increased spending in non-GAAP R&D of 8% in '23 over '22, coupled with the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, continues to broaden and strengthen our balanced portfolio across therapeutic areas. With our strong late-stage innovative pipeline moving forward through development, we expect our non-GAAP R&D to continue to increase in 2024."", ""Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. Amgen, Ohio, our new advanced assembly and final product packaging plant has just received license from the FDA for commercial production in January, roughly 2 years after we broke ground and our innovative drug substance plan under construction in North Carolina is expected to be operational by 2026. In addition, we've positioned the organization to accelerate investments in innovation, including leveraging the power of generative artificial intelligence. And third, we returned capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $2.13 per share in the quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022 four [ph] quarters."", ""Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024. First, because this is the first full year incorporating the impact of Horizon, we're providing some additional granularity in our guidance, which we don't expect to repeat to the same extent in the future. For 2024, we're expecting revenue of $32.4 billion to $33.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $18.90 to $20.30. As we continue to integrate Horizon, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2024, and we're on track to meet the synergies target previously communicated of at least $500 million in pretax cost by year 3 after closing or in 2026. Our revenue range reflects our strong growth outlook driven by numerous opportunities across our four therapeutic area pillars."", 'We will record a full year of legacy Horizon product sales, and we expect continued volume-driven growth in our priority products Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Prolia and BLINCYTO consistent with industry trends in our recent history, we expect mid single-digit price decline for our portfolio in 2024. As a reminder, as you model the first quarter of 2024 and consistent with our historical trends, we expect first quarter product sales to be the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance reverifications and increased co-pay charges. So we expect the first quarter of 2024 total revenue to grow roughly 20% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.', ""And we continue to efficiently run the business through our disciplined approach to managing operating expenses. In 2024, we're making incremental R&D investments to support our promising late-stage pipeline, including our rapidly advancing oncology programs as discussed following ESMO in October and other programs, including MariTide. Furthermore, the addition of Horizon has an impact on the 2024 operating margin given the timing of when synergies are realized. As a result, we project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 48%. Note that we expect non-GAAP operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. There are primarily three reasons for this. First, typical lower product sales in Q1, as I mentioned above, and in each of the following quarters."", 'Second, increased spend on our commercial brands will continue building on the investments we made in the second half of 2023, including Repatha, Otezla, and our bone portfolio of EVENITY and Prolia And third, Q1 2024 reflects the addition of Horizon, for which we are just at the beginning stages of realizing synergies given the acquisition close date of October 6. So we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be roughly 43% in the first quarter. I would reiterate that we expect operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 17% to 18% as a percentage of product sales for the 2024 year. Taking into account the full year of Horizon related expenses, we expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2024 to increase approximately 20% year-over-year with investments also increasing to advance key pipeline assets, including AMG 193, MariTide, rocatinlimab and tarlatamab.', ""We see significant potential in our innovative pipeline, and it is important that we strategically invest now to fully unlock the opportunities ahead to create long-term value for patients, staff and shareholders. And for non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect 2024 full year amounts as a percentage of product sales to be between 21% and 22%. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. As mentioned on our Q3 '23 call, the '24 guidance includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt rates for the Horizon acquisition. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17%. Our guidance is primarily being driven by two factors. The first is the jurisdictional mix of income, including the full year benefits associated with the Horizon transaction and the legal entity rationalization undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2023 in part to integrate the Horizon entities into our existing U.S. headquartered legal entity structure."", ""The second is the benefit from a planned payment to the IRS as an advanced deposit as we've done in the past to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions. There is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal arguments with the IRS as we prepare for trial. Given the interest rate environment, although the deposit negatively affects our cash flow in '24, if any of the deposit is returned to us upon the resolution of our litigation, those funds would accrue interest income. Therefore, the makes this payment makes this payment a prudent use of our capital. Once again, out of an abundance of clarity, this represents no change in our belief in the merits of the tax court case. The guidance also includes the impact of the adoption of the OECD 15% minimum tax by certain jurisdictions."", ""Based on our individual footprint, we don't anticipate any significant effects of the new rules in 2024, but we're closely watching the global tax landscape for future impacts as the framework continues to be considered by additional jurisdictions and new rules take effect. We expect governments around the world, including the United States to continue to look for more sources of tax revenue from large multinational corporations that could result in higher taxes in the coming years. Similar to 2023, we expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2024 we expect that we will continue to increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion in 2024, consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business, including the Ohio and North Carolina facilities I mentioned ahead and into the rare disease pillar."", ""In summary, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2023. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen is strong, and we believe that our new rare disease pillar, one of our four pillars will be an important additive source of growth for the company. This concludes the financial update.

Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon; Vikram Karnani; Jay Bradner, who I'm pleased to welcome and is joining us for the first time on our quarterly earnings call; and Peter Griffith. Dave Reese will also be available during the Q&A session.Given the timing of the Horizon Therapeutics acquisition close, the results as shown in our press release and slides include contribution from the Horizon business from October 6 onwards. For the avoidance of doubt, this will also be the basis for our filed financial results. To supplement this information, Vikram will also provide sales information for these products for the full fourth quarter, including the first week of October, as further context in his remarks. Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement. And please note that actual results can vary materially.With that, over to you, Bob."", 'Robert A. Bradway', ""Okay. Thank you, Justin, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. 2023 was another year of performance and progress for Amgen, further positioning us to deliver attractive growth through the end of the decade and beyond. Last year, we delivered double-digit volume growth in all 4 quarters with balanced growth across products and geographies. 18 of our medicines generated record annual sales, including Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA. The acquisition of Horizon, which was completed on October 6, gives us a significant new rare disease business that now stands as a fourth pillar of growth alongside our leading general medicine, oncology and inflammation businesses.The medicines we acquired are all very early in their life cycles and by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics manufacturing, decades of experience in inflammation and our extensive global presence, we believe these products have the potential to reach many more patients around the world. Last year, we also advanced the deepest and most diverse pipeline in our history with promising molecules at all stages of development across our 4 pillars of growth. We anticipate well over a dozen significant pipeline milestones this year. I'll touch on a few.In general medicine, we'll generate Phase II data this year for our lead obesity molecule, MariTide, and we're excited, of course, to learn more about this asset. We're also advancing a number of early-stage assets in this space.In oncology, we have a June 12 PDUFA date for the FDA to complete its priority review of tarlatamab as a third-line treatment for small cell lung cancer. Tarlatamab is the first bispecific T-cell engager shown to be effective in addressing a major solid tumor, in this case, one for which there has been no new treatment in decades and which today, has a 5-year survival rate of just 3%. We're studying tarlatamab in earlier lines of treatment and hope over the fullness of time to be able to serve the tens of thousands of patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer each year in the U.S. and major markets around the world. We've done this very successfully now with our first BiTE, BLINCYTO, which has steadily moved into earlier lines of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and we'll take the same approach with yet another promising BiTE, that being xaluritamig, in prostate cancer.In inflammation, we'll have Phase III data from rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis from the first of what are now 8 trials in the ROCKET program. And in rare disease, we'll have Phase III data for UPLIZNA in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease. At a time when a rapidly aging global population needs more innovation, Amgen is delivering, both with the medicines we have in the market today and with the promising new medicines that are advancing in our pipeline.We're also excited by the rapid convergence of biotech and tech, which is enabling us to innovate more quickly and confidently. We've been preparing for this hinge moment for more than a decade and recently named Dave Reese as our first ever Chief Technology Officer to ensure that we're capitalizing on technologies like generative artificial intelligence, not just in R&D, but across the entire company. Succeeding Dave as Amgen's Head of R&D is Jay Bradner. Jay is a physician scientist and a seasoned R&D leader having served for many years as President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. Jay previously also served as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and, prior to joining Amgen, was a practicing oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We're delighted to have Jay on board and excited by the work that he, Dave and the rest of our team will do together to accelerate innovation at Amgen for the good of patients and for the long-term growth of our business.And with that, I want to thank our 27,000 employees around the world for their many contributions to our success. And let me now ask Murdo to talk about our commercial performance in 2023."", 'Murdo Gordon', ""Thanks, Bob. I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023. Execution was strong across the business, resulting in record sales in the year for 18 brands and robust volume growth across the 4 pillars of our business. Full year product sales increased 9% year-over-year. Volume growth was 15% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 14%, and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Canada region was 10%. Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest-growing region with 41% volume growth. These results include $954 million of sales from the legacy Horizon portfolio from the period of October 6 through December 31.I'll start with our general medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY and Aimovig. Overall revenue for these 4 products grew 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year driven by 18% and 20% volume growth, respectively. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter with volume growth of 35% partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside of the U.S., we saw 25% volume growth with strength across our regions.In the U.S., volume growth of 48% was driven by a 66% increase in the number of new patients starting treatment. We saw a decline in net selling price in the U.S. primarily driven by new formulary coverage. We expect this additional coverage to lead to strong volume growth, which will more than offset declining net selling price. In addition, some payers have recently removed prior authorization for some patients, which will further ease their access to Repatha.We remain committed to the urgent need to educate physicians and patients on the importance of LDL-C lowering to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In the U.S., we activated more than 20,000 new prescribing physicians in 2023 in both the primary care and cardiology settings. And while we're pleased with this progress, we'll continue to work tirelessly for the many, many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha.Transitioning to bone health. EVENITY had record sales of $318 million for the quarter driven by 39% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women, and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In the U.S., only 6% of very high risk patients with osteoporosis are treated with a bone builder, creating an urgent need for treatment with an effective therapy. EVENITY is an important therapy to address this unmet need as it is the only bone builder that works with the body's natural ability to increase bone formation and also decrease bone resorption. We see strong growth potential for EVENITY, and we'll continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure it reaches all the patients who need it.Prolia sales grew 12% year-over-year to a record $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 10% was supported by real-world evidence reaffirming Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at a high risk of fracture.Moving to our oncology business, which includes BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and XGEVA. Sales of these 6 innovative products grew 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter with 3% volume growth. Full year sales grew 12% year-over-year driven by 12% volume growth. BLINCYTO sales grew 47% year-over-year to a record $241 million for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 55% was supported by broad prescribing to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in frontline consolidation treatment. Long term, we see significant growth potential for BLINCYTO from utilization earlier in the front line as part of induction treatment.LUMAKRAS sales increased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 5%, and KYPROLIS sales grew 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, both driven by volume growth.Nplate sales decreased 18% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by volume decline related to timing of orders placed by the U.S. government, partially offset by volume growth across our regions. Full year sales increased 13%, primarily driven by volume growth, including U.S. government orders. Excluding U.S. government orders, Nplate sales grew 23% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year.Transitioning to our inflammation business. Otezla sales increased 2% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 3% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory levels and lower net selling price. Full year sales decreased 4% driven by lower net selling price and lower inventory levels partially offset by 2% volume growth. New patient starts for Otezla grew 6% in the fourth quarter driven by strong execution and increased investment. Competitor free drug programs had a reduced impact in the quarter. Otezla is uniquely positioned to grow in 2024 and beyond, given its indication for all severities of psoriasis, combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation and convenient oral administration.Enbrel sales decreased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter driven by a 4% impact from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. U.S. volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter, supported by an increase in new patients starting treatment as a result of improved payer coverage. Going forward, we expect net selling price to continue to decline year-over-year driven by higher rebates to maintain broad first-line payer coverage and changes in patient mix.TEZSPIRE continues a strong launch trajectory with $177 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $567 million for the full year. Sales increased 10% sequentially driven by volume growth. Our successful launch of a self-administered, prefilled, single-use pen allowed us to expand coverage with major pharmacy benefit managers to over 80%, contributing to higher new patient growth as the year progressed. Moving forward, we expect this expanded coverage will allow TEZSPIRE to help even more patients with severe uncontrolled asthma.Sales of TAVNEOS were $44 million in the quarter and $134 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we saw 17% quarter-over-quarter volume growth in the U.S. Approximately 2,700 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 1,700 health care professionals. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 10% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year driven by 27% and 29% volume growth. This volume growth was partially offset by net selling price decline. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches.Overall, our execution is strong across the business, underscored by our foundational commitment to serve patients. The 4 pillars of our portfolio position us well to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies.And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio."", 'Vikram Karnani', ""Thanks, Murdo. I am glad to share an update on our rare disease business now that we are 4 months past due close. We are now fully operating as part of Amgen with integration activities ongoing. As Bob has mentioned before, we are excited to be Amgen's fourth pillar of long-term growth. I wanted to make sure you're aware that we are not reporting the full quarter in press release and slides, which reflects sales from October 6 onwards and total $954 million. This excludes $41 million of sales that occurred in the first week of October prior to deal close. For the full quarter, our rare disease brands from Horizon delivered product sales of $995 million, representing 6% year-over-year sales growth. Throughout the remainder of my remarks, I will reference full quarter product sales.TEPEZZA and IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for patients with thyroid eye disease generated $467 million of sales during the entire fourth quarter, representing 3% quarter-over-quarter growth. This is the third quarter in a row of quarter-over-quarter growth for TEPEZZA with the growth largely driven by the U.S. We saw a number of positive leading indicators, including a record number of unique TEPEZZA prescribers, total patient enrollment forms and patient starts in 2023. Additionally, thanks to our efforts, we've been able to generate favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives, and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024.We continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate to severe disease in the U.S. who could benefit from TEPEZZA, with the majority of these patients in low clinical activity score settings. Given positive leading indicators and high unmet need, we see a long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA in the U.S. while also recognizing there is some time lag between our execution efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers.International expansion also remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA. TEPEZZA is approved in Brazil, and we are progressing towards approval in additional countries. Our expansion into both Japan and Europe is a high priority with regulatory review underway in Japan and filings in the EU throughout the year.KRYSTEXXA, a pegylated uricase enzyme for patients with chronic refractory gout, delivered a record $280 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 30% year-over-year growth, driven by continued strong commercial execution. Sales are now annualizing $1 billion run rate. Performance was driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand generation, stakeholder engagement and adherence to treatment.UPLIZNA, an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody, which is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $70 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 68% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex U.S. markets.Our remaining ultra rare portfolio generated $178 million of sales for the entire fourth quarter, primarily driven by our ultra rare medicines, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE. Looking ahead at 2024, by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics capabilities, decades of experience in inflammation and extensive global presence, we are ready to reach more patients than ever before.I will now turn it over to Jay."", 'James E. Bradner', ""Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take a minute to convey how thrilled I am to join the Amgen R&D organization and this leadership team. The creativity of our discovery research, expert and expedited clinical development, most authoritative biomanufacturing organization in the industry, all were well known to me before joining. But now on staff at Amgen, I appreciate the strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness, the like-minded commitment, growing the impact of our medicines and our business and the shared conviction in this remarkable portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines.In 2023, we executed with speed across our clinical pipeline, achieving excellent enrollment in key programs and setting up 2024 as the year with significant data readouts across the portfolio for medicines with the potential to transform patient care. Key highlights in 2023 included the delivery of promising data from 4 key oncology assets and the attainment of 3 breakthrough therapy designations in oncology. We initiated pivotal Phase III studies for tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer, LUMAKRAS in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, along with dazodalibep in Sjögren's syndrome. In general medicine, as previously disclosed, top line 52-week data from the 592-patient MariTide Phase II study is expected by late 2024. Leveraging the durability of weight loss observed in Phase I and rapid enrollment enjoyed in Phase II, we recently added a part 2 to this study, which explores durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. Our planning for a comprehensive Phase III program across multiple indications remains on track.Lastly, you may have seen that yesterday, Nature Metabolism published a manuscript from Amgen R&D that provides the integration of MariTide preclinical and Phase I data. Beyond MariTide, our obesity strategy encompasses several assets with AMG 786 in Phase I and additional preclinical assets advancing. Our approach is tailored to meet the dynamic needs of obesity treatment, demonstrating a longitudinal commitment to innovation and patient care in this field.The Phase III outcome study of olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, has enrolled more than 7,000 patients globally. This rapid enrollment accomplished in just 1 year across 34 countries and over 700 sites underscores the medical community's strong interest in and the potential impact of olpasiran. We've deliberately expanded our initial enrollment target from 6,000 to over 7,000 patients to ensure comprehensive demographic representation and to satisfy regional regulatory requirements. We are on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2024.In oncology, we're focused on approaching high conviction targets with differentiated therapies for large effect sizes. We're pleased to announce that the FDA granted priority review for BLINCYTO in early-stage CD19-positive B-ALL with a PDUFA date of June 21, 2024. The ongoing Phase III Golden Gate study is enrolling patients to evaluate the effectiveness of alternating BLINCYTO with low-intensity chemotherapy curing older adults diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL. We're also planning to amend this study to evaluate subcutaneous administration of blinatumomab with initiation anticipated in the second half of 2024, potentially allowing us to serve more patients and treating physicians.Lastly, we're pleased to announce that just today, the American Journal of Hematology published a manuscript highlighting data from the dose expansion phase of our ongoing Phase Ib study of subcutaneous blinatumomab as a single agent in adult patients with heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL. Of 27 evaluable patients treated, we observed an 85% complete response rate, of which 75% were MRD negative. Subcutaneous blinatumomab was well tolerated with no observed grade 4 cytokine release syndrome.Turning to tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3 targeting BiTE molecule. The FDA granted priority review following promising results from the Phase II DeLLphi-301 clinical trial and a PDUFA date of June 12, 2024. We are rapidly advancing tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment, where we have initiated 2 Phase III studies and plan to initiate a third in the first half of 2024.Xaluritamig, a first-in-class STEAP1 bispecific molecule being studied in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, continues to progress following the presentation of encouraging Phase I data last fall. We are ahead of schedule with the monotherapy dose expansion and expect to complete enrollment in the coming weeks. We've opened a reduced monitoring cohort and are making significant progress in dose range finding studies in combination with novel hormonal therapy combinations.For AMG 193, an oral MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, we're encouraged by 9 responses we've seen across 7 MTAP-null solid tumors. AMG 193 is a terrific example of a medicine targeting a genetically-defined synthetic lethality and a first clinical translation of our induced proximity platform. We're now swiftly moving forward with dose expansion studies and plan to enter master protocols in thoracic and gastrointestinal malignancies, exploring combinations with standard of care in the first half of 2024.In our inflammation portfolio, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE in indications beyond severe asthma, including separate Phase III studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected in the second half of 2024, as well as in eosinophilic esophagitis. We also remain on track to present Phase II COPD data in the first half of 2024.Our ROCKET Phase III program for rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, has successfully enrolled over 2,400 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We're introducing an eighth study to the ROCKET program to explore an auto-injector, and we are planning to initiate both the Phase III study in prurigo nodularis and a Phase II study in asthma this year as we seek to broadly explore the potential of rocatinlimab.Lastly, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid- to late-stage opportunities. In December, TEPEZZA received orphan drug designation in Japan, where we've also recently submitted a new drug application for TEPEZZA in thyroid eye disease. To serve additional patients in Japan, we have a Phase III study underway in the setting of chronic disease with a low clinical activity score. Beyond Japan, we are progressing TEPEZZA subcutaneous administration to drive increased adoption and improve patient experience and plan to initiate a Phase III study in thyroid eye disease this year.With UPLIZNA, we anticipate important Phase III data readouts this year in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease, both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients. Dazodalibep, an innovative CD40 ligand inhibitor fusion protein, has entered Phase III for Sjögren's syndrome. This follows encouraging Phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden. Dazodalibep is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in this latter patient population. Closing out our rare disease efforts, we're excited about fipaxalparant, an LPAR1 antagonist being studied in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, on track for a Phase II proof-of-concept data readout in the second half of 2024.In closing, I'm delighted to report on the important progress we made advancing our innovative pipeline, and I'm looking forward to sharing more pipeline milestones through 2024. I'll now turn it over to you, Peter."", 'Peter H. Griffith', ""Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023. In the fourth quarter, total revenue of $8.2 billion grew 20% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 grew 15% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered total revenue of $28.2 billion, 7% growth year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS of $18.65, 5% growth year-over-year. As a reminder, both Q4 and the full year results include Horizon's results beginning October 6, when the acquisition closed, so our financial results will exclude approximately 1 week of Horizon's results from our fourth quarter results. I'll review the details of our fourth quarter and full year financial results before discussing our outlook for 2024. The financial results are shown on Slides 54 to 56 of the slide deck.Turning to our fourth quarter total revenue of $8.2 billion. We saw product sales increase 20% year-over-year, driven by volume growth of 23%, offset by net selling price decline of 3%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, product sales increased 5% year-over-year driven by volume growth of 9%. Full year total revenues of $28.2 billion grew 7% year-over-year. Product sales increased 9% year-over-year driven by 15% volume growth. Other revenues decreased 16% year-over-year primarily due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly in 2022.Strong expense discipline resulted in a 50% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales for the full year 2023 while we continued to focus on both internal and external innovation, investing $4.7 billion in our pipeline and $27.8 billion in our acquisition of Horizon. With product sales volume growth at 23% in Q4 and 15% for the full year, we still efficiently managed the operating expenses of the business, Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 18% year-over-year while full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9%.Excluding the impact of Horizon, Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% and full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 5%. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was flat on a year-over-year basis at 16.3%. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased by 1.1 percentage points to 17.0%. The full year increase was primarily driven by higher profit share and changes in our product mix partially offset by the replacement of the Puerto Rico excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the fourth quarter increased 16% year-over-year and 8% year-over-year for the full year primarily due to higher spend on later-stage clinical programs and marketed product support, including spend on programs acquired from the Horizon acquisition and continuing investment in our pipeline, including MariTide.Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 20% year-over-year primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by a decline in other marketed product spend. Non-GAAP OI&E were about $635 million in expense in the fourth quarter, a $168 million increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased interest expense related to the debt issued for the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP OI&E was favorable $279 million year-over-year, primarily driven by the change in accounting for the BeiGene investment to the fair value mark-to-market method and by gains related to early debt retirement, partially offset by higher net interest expense.Our non-GAAP tax rate increased 2.5 percentage points year-over-year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter and 2.7 percentage points year-over-year to 16.5% for the full year primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change mentioned previously. The company generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow in 2023 compared with $8.8 billion in 2022. The decrease is driven by the Horizon transaction and integration costs, higher repatriation tax payments and higher capital expenditures. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows with the addition of Horizon and are on track with our deleveraging plans to return to our efficient capital structure by the end of 2025.In summary, we continue to execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation. Our increased spending and non-GAAP R&D of 8% in '23 over '22, coupled with the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, continues to broaden and strengthen our balanced portfolio across therapeutic areas. With our strong late-stage innovative pipeline moving forward through development, we expect our non-GAAP R&D to continue to increase in 2024.Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. Amgen Ohio, our new advanced assembly and final product packaging plant, has just received licensure from the FDA for commercial production in January, roughly 2 years after we broke ground, and our innovative drug substance plant under construction in North Carolina is expected to be operational by 2026. In addition, we've positioned the organization to accelerate investments in innovation, including leveraging the power of generative artificial intelligence. And third, we return capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $2.13 per share in the quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022's 4 quarters.Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024. First, because this is the first full year incorporating the impact of Horizon, we're providing some additional granularity in our guidance, which we don't expect to repeat to the same extent in the future. For 2024, we're expecting revenue of $32.4 billion to $33.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $18.90 to $20.30. As we continue to integrate Horizon, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2024. And we're on track to meet the synergies target previously communicated of at least $500 million in pretax cost by year 3 after closing or in 2026. Our revenue range reflects our strong growth outlook driven by numerous opportunities across our 4 therapeutic area pillars. We will record a full year of legacy Horizon product sales, and we expect continued volume-driven growth in our priority products, Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Otezla, Prolia and BLINCYTO. Consistent with industry trends in our recent history, we expect mid-single-digit price decline for our portfolio in 2024.As a reminder, as you model the first quarter of 2024 and consistent with our historical trends, we expect first quarter product sales to be the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance reverifications and increased co-pay charges. So we expect the first quarter of 2024 total revenue to grow roughly 20% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And we continue to efficiently run the business through our disciplined approach to managing operating expenses.In 2024, we're making incremental R&D investments to support our promising late-stage pipeline, including our rapidly advancing oncology programs as discussed following ESMO in October and other programs, including MariTide. Furthermore, the addition of Horizon has an impact on the 2024 operating margin given the timing of when synergies are realized.As a result, we project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 48%. Note that we expect non-GAAP operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter.There are primarily 3 reasons for this: first, typical lower product sales in Q1, as I mentioned above, and in each of the following quarters; second, increased spend on our commercial brands will continue, building on the investments we made in the second half of 2023, including Repatha, Otezla and our bone portfolio, EVENITY and Prolia; and third, Q1 2024 reflects the addition of Horizon, for which we are just at the beginning stages of realizing synergies given the acquisition close date of October 6.So we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be roughly 43% in the first quarter. I would reiterate that we expect operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 17% to 18% as a percentage of product sales for the 2024 year. Taking into account the full year of Horizon-related expenses, we expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2024 to increase approximately 20% year-over-year, with investments also increasing to advance key pipeline assets, including AMG 193, MariTide, rocatinlimab and tarlatamab. We see significant potential in our innovative pipeline, and it is important that we strategically invest now to fully unlock the opportunities ahead to create long-term value for patients, staff and shareholders.And for non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect 2024 full year amounts as a percentage of product sales to be between 21% and 22%. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. As mentioned on our Q3 '23 call, the '24 guidance includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt rates for the Horizon acquisition.We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17%. Our guidance is primarily being driven by 2 factors. The first is the jurisdictional mix of income, including the full year benefits associated with the Horizon transaction, and the legal entity rationalization undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2023 in part to integrate the Horizon entities into our existing U.S.-headquartered legal entity structure. The second is the benefit from a planned payment to the IRS as an advanced deposit as we've done in the past to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions. There is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal arguments with the IRS as we prepare for trial.Given the interest rate environment, although the deposit negatively affects our cash flow in '24, if any of the deposit is returned to us upon the resolution of our litigation, those funds would accrue interest income. Therefore, the rate arbitrage makes this payment a prudent use of our capital. Once again, out of an abundance of clarity, this represents no change in our belief in the merits of the tax court case. The guidance also includes the impact of the adoption of the OECD 15% minimum tax by certain jurisdictions. Based on our individual footprint, we don't anticipate any significant effects of the new rules in 2024, but we're closely watching the global tax landscape for future impacts as the framework continues to be considered by additional jurisdictions and new rules take effect. We expect governments around the world, including the United States, to continue to look for more sources of tax revenue from large multinational corporations that could result in higher taxes in the coming years.Similar to 2023, we expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2024. We expect that we will continue to increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion in 2024, consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business, including the Ohio and North Carolina facilities I mentioned ahead and into the rare disease pillar.In summary, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2023. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen is strong, and we believe that our new rare disease pillar, 1 of our 4 pillars, will be an important additive source of growth for the company. This concludes the financial update. My thanks to my approximately 27,000-plus colleagues at Amgen around the world for their commitment to our mission of serving patients and their tireless efforts in 2023.I'll turn it back to Bob for Q&A."", 'Robert A. Bradway', ""Okay. Thank you. Let's open the line, and we'll take questions from our callers. And Julianne, why don't you remind them of the procedures, so we can get through these questions here efficiently for everyone."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies.', 'Michael Jonathan Yee', 'Thanks for good results and good guidance. We had a question on obesity. On 133, of course, you had the publication yesterday. I feel like it was the most scrutinized Phase I publication. But maybe you could just talk to -- maybe Jay could talk to your interpretation of some of the markers, for example, lipids, A1c, blood pressure and all that kind of thing. And maybe talk about your confidence level about the profile versus competitors.', 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. Thanks a lot, Michael. We really appreciate the consideration the Phase I paper is receiving from the community. It's exciting to report these data. For those who haven't seen it, this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 49 patients looking at safety, PK, PD, single ascending dose, 7 cohorts, multiple ascending dose 3 cohorts, 3 monthly doses, patients with obesity, BMI greater than 30. And we were quite pleased with the outcome. Looking at the 420-milligram dose, as an example, which was the highest dose study, 14.5% weight loss at only day 85. And moreover, quite durable coming off of that medicine out to 150 days, all with relatively mild gastrointestinal side effects. And so to answer your last question first, we find the Phase I data, which we're pleased to share with the community, to be quite supportive of our ongoing work to develop this medicine to the greatest possible benefit of patients suffering from obesity.Now you've asked questions around some of the measurements on the study, lipid, blood pressure and A1c. And I would just caution that this is a Phase I trial, the numbers are very small, that the duration of treatment is rather short. But even with all of those caveats, while hard to draw conclusions from such small numbers, especially labile measurements like blood pressure and lipids, all are directionally favorable. And so we have -- we take no concern whatsoever from those measurements on the study."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.', 'Salveen Jaswal Richter', 'Another one here on the obesity program. So post the published Phase I data, how are you thinking about differentiation on GI tolerability? Is the dose range being evaluated in the Phase II study similar to that in the Phase I?', 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take this one as well. As you may or may not know, the Phase II study, which is ongoing at present and going very well, explores 11 dosing cohorts with relevant placebo controls. And through that study, we'll have a chance to gain an experience with a longer exposure to MariTide dosed in different ways. We've recently added a part 2 to this study that will allow us to explore even more durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks enabled by just very rapid enrollment. And these 4 dosing cohorts will go on to test dose level and even less frequent dosing schedules than monthly. And so these Phase II data, even by end of year, will be strongly instructive as to finding a safe and tolerated and efficacious dose to carry into Phase III clinical investigation."", 'Murdo Gordon', ""Yes. The only thing I would add is we're starting from a basis of a monthly dosing cadence and schedule. And so the additional dosing cohorts would look at potential dosing schedule beyond monthly. And the data are pretty clear in the market right now. The GI toxicity or GI side effects are generally related to the day of dosing of the GLP-1s, which are dosed weekly. We see some of that same GI side effect profile in kind of the first dose part of the dose titration. But there's an opportunity here to potentially spread the dosing intervals out further and further improve tolerability in our program. And as Jay clearly described, we've got all of the different aspects of that being studied in the Phase II program."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer.', 'Jay Olson', ""Congrats on the progress. Another question on 133. Talk about whether or not (inaudible) that we see later this year will include patients from (inaudible) of the study? And do you think it's possible that 133 could be dosed once every 2 or 3 months? And also, if you could just comment on the rollover rate of patients from part 1 to part 2?"", 'Robert A. Bradway', 'Jay, could you catch all that? Some of what Jay asked was broken up there at the beginning.', 'James E. Bradner', 'The third part was a little bit broken off of your question. I heard a better explanation of part 2 frequency of dosing. And then I did not hear your third part.', 'Jay Olson', ""If you'd just comment on the rate of patients rolling over from part 1 to part 2."", 'James E. Bradner', ""Okay. Yes. Thank you for the question, Jay. Let me give a little bit of context on this part 2 study that I think will help answer them. In part 2, the intent is to really look at durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. And so by durable weight loss, patients eligible for part 2, which begins at the end of 52 weeks, will be responding to this medicine. And then they'll be rerandomized to 4 cohorts. That will test dose level and, again, this even less frequent dosing schedule. We have not disclosed the granularity on the dosing schedule. This is a competitive environment. But we're afforded this chance because the ADC, the antibody core of MariTide, like so many immunoglobulin therapeutics, allows for the opportunity to use it much less frequently. The rate of patients rolling over to part 2 will be established as the Phase II study continues to progress this year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.', 'Christopher Thomas Schott', ""Just maybe to pivot over to TEPEZZA for a question. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics for 2024? It seems like the products come back to growth. But I'm just trying to get a sense of now that Amgen owns the asset and has more kind of time with it, what are your top priorities? And how do you think about continuing to kind of grow the new patient base here?"", 'Robert A. Bradway', ""Sure. Chris, maybe we'll take it in a couple of parts. But Vikram, share your thoughts first."", 'Vikram Karnani', ""Yes. Thank you for the question. I think if you focus a little bit on what are the underlying factors that are driving TEPEZZA growth, we saw a record number of unique TEPEZZA prescribers. We saw an increase in patient enrollment forms and patient starts. In addition, we've made pretty significant progress on payer coverage as we've seen our covered lives have now increased to greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives, and that's important. Educating some of those stakeholders on the new clinical data, updated indication, it continues to drive uptake across the full spectrum of TED patients. And finally, what holds all of this together is a really robust patient service model that supports patient access.I think we continue to make progress and execute towards each one of these important leading indicators. And we shouldn't forget that there is still low penetration of the approximately 100,000 patients that can be eligible for this medicine in the U.S. alone.Now just one last point here is that as we've noted before, there continues to be a time lag between the execution of all of these efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. As we said before, it can take up to 90 days once a patient is identified for therapy for that patient to actually get on therapy. But we're pretty happy with all of our leading indicators and the execution that we have seen coming out of last year."", 'Robert A. Bradway', ""And Chris, the only thing I would add is, building on what Vikram said in his prepared remarks, we're excited about the international opportunity as well. And I think he characterized that well previously. And we're also excited about what we see as ongoing opportunities to invest in innovation for the benefit of TED patients. So all in all, I feel excited about the rare disease pillar that we've established and the role that TEPEZZA will play in it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets.', 'Evan David Seigerman', 'I wanted to touch on TEZSPIRE specifically in COPD. How are you planning to differentiate given the pretty competitive data we saw from Dupixent? And how should investors be looking at this data from an efficacy bar? Are there nuances in this trial that need to be clarified that might make it harder to do an apples-to-apples comparison?', 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. Evan, thanks for the question. Murdo, why don't I start and then you add on. So it's a great and timely question. The Phase II COPD study of TEZSPIRE, we expect data in the first half of this year. This was a big study, 337 patients, moderate to severe COPD. They're having exacerbations despite being on triple therapy, and so reflective of the current unmet need and inadequacy of therapy for patients with COPD.This is a slightly broader population than Dupi that we're studying here. We're totally on track for the readout. We quite like the mechanism here. You must know that TSLP works as a signaling factor upstream. And by blocking it with our unique biotherapeutic, we block TSLP, IL-25, IL-33 signaling. TSLP hits so many cell types, modulating this airway type 2 response. By hitting TSLP upstream, we think we can really have an impact on the disease biology.We see TSLP elevated in the serum of patients in bronchial mucosa and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. It's released by airway epithelium. There's just a lot of signals from the basic biology of this disease pointing to a medicine of this nature. And by looking at the broader population than they did with Dupi, we have a chance to really figure out who the responder is. Murdo?"", 'Murdo Gordon', ""I think you've covered all the bases. I would just add this, Evan, that with the unique and differentiated mechanism, as Jay described, we hope we can treat a broader population of patients than perhaps the currently available therapies. And we also recognize that there are patients who are refractory to those currently available therapies, and we would obviously want to understand if they would be responders to TEZSPIRE. I think we've got strong commercial capabilities, including with our partners at AstraZeneca, and are well positioned to take a product like this into the market if we're successful in Phase III."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.', 'Umer Raffat', ""I wanted to touch up on AMG 133 as well, 2 parts question. First, on the discontinuations at the high dose, we know 5 out of 8 did not finish the full duration of the study. But there was a second arm also of this high-dose 420-milligram with 10 patients, which was not reported. This was the one with digital tools. Could you speak to the discontinuation rate in that arm? This is the 420 done separately, which is not part of the paper.And secondly, I know there's a case of liver enzyme elevation of the 280 mg dose, but this patient also had COVID. Could you perhaps speak to the timing of liver enzyme elevation relative to the COVID episode?"", 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. Thanks, Umer. I won't be able to provide patient level insights to the Phase I study at this time, but I do appreciate your question and your interest in the report. I'll speak to the dropouts of the Phase I at the 420-milligram dose, which was 4 out of the 8 patients. First, it's notable to say that the high dose cohort in the multiple ascending dose receiving the 3 doses of 420 experienced real weight loss, real benefit of 14.5% after these 3 monthly doses. This was the group that proved actually quite durable out to day 150. Four subjects declined to participate in this clinical study setting largely for logistical reasons. The AEs and other characteristics were comparable to all the other patients in the study. Now the second question around the digital group, I don't have insight into that. Dave, do you?"", 'David M. Reese', ""No. I mean we can get back to you on that. I don't know that we reported that -- those data in the discontinuation rate."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS.', 'Colin Nigel Bristow', 'Maybe a couple more on MariTide. First, could you provide some insight into the dosing? I mean, obviously, these are pretty large doses. And if we look at -- like Repatha 420 milligrams takes over 5 minutes by infusion or 3 consecutive injections. So I was wondering if you could give any insight there.And then in terms of the relative affinity for GIPs versus GLPs, MariTide seems to have -- or preferentially favor GLP much more than competitor molecules. And so do you think the ultimate clinical profile is more closely going to resemble that of the long-acting GLP-1 versus competitor GLPs?', 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. Thanks, Colin. I appreciate the deep consideration of the molecule, especially. I'd start by saying I don't regard these doses as high. I'm new here. But 420 milligrams for a biotherapeutic that's an antibody drug conjugate with a peptide antibody ratio of 2:1 seems well in scope for a modern biotherapeutic product. I don't need to tell this community paying so close -- such close attention to Amgen that this is a very sophisticated biotherapeutics organization and on the manufacturing side, just every patient every time, and that we have all the capabilities necessary to deliver this medicine at whichever of these 3 or other dose and schedule we arrive at. So no concerns there for me whatsoever.Regarding the balance of the pharmacology, you do invoke a difference between our medicine and medicines developed by peer pharmaceutical companies, namely mechanistically, the core antibody of MariTide inhibits the GIP receptor, whereas these other peptide medicines agonize it. We feel very secure in our choice to inhibit that receptor supported by just the finest level of experimental data available, experiments of nature that genome-wide association studies in very large populations have pointed to a need, an opportunity to inhibit the GIP receptor to deliver lower BMI as observed with variance in that receptor and downstream signaling pathways that correlate with reduced body mass index in large populations.As to the balance, which you ask, between inhibition of GIP receptor and agonism of GLP-1, these are very difficult measurements to make in humans. But our modeling suggests that, with the therapeutic doses and exposures that we observe, that we are achieving both."", 'Murdo Gordon', ""And Colin, it's Murdo. I would just add that from a patient experience perspective, we've learned a lot from other biologics. And Amgen has a world-class process development, manufacturing and device team, and we've done a lot of work on this one and we anticipate a very positive and simple patient experience on at least a monthly dosing schedule. And we've learned a lot from Repatha specifically, and there's more to follow on Repatha from that, but we continue to work to improve patient experience with our biologic injectables."", 'Robert A. Bradway', ""Just as we go to the next question, let me observe that we're almost up to the hour that we actually all set aside because I know we still have quite a few questions in the queue. So we'll try to get one question per caller here and get through. We'll stay through the queue of calls or questions rather that's still waiting for us, but I know some of you may have to drop."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen.', 'Brendan Mychal Smith', ""All right. Great. This is Brendan on for Yaron. Just a quick one from us, actually. Based on the data you've seen so far and maybe some feedback from physicians that you've heard, this is on UPLIZNA. Where do you kind of see UPLIZNA fitting into maybe the MG treatment paradigm given all the competition there, but maybe more to the point, how you're thinking about expansion opportunities, given all the different autoimmune indications you could potentially pursue? Just trying to kind of understand how you see longer-term growth there."", 'Robert A. Bradway', ""First, why don't we ask Vikram just to address the performance of the product right now in NMOSD, and then a combination of Jay and Dave can talk about the other activities or other potential applications."", 'Vikram Karnani', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, UPLIZNA is actually growing quite nicely and quite fun in NMOSD. As you know, it is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD. We continue to execute across a variety of fronts. I mean we're -- we see this product nicely positioned versus -- as it's appropriate for NMOSD patients and within the competitive environment that we operate in. And we've continued to make significant progress over the last 18 months or so, maybe even longer, of continuing to drive more growth with newer prescribers and even depth with existing prescribers. So the product continues to do well. And I think we hope to continue to deliver good execution on this medicine in NMOSD. Maybe, Jay, you want to talk about the second question?"", 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. No, I'm happy to. As you may know, I'm a hematologist. I think CD19 is a terrific target. It's expressed really on all B-cells and spares plasma cells. And therefore, considering indication expansion, as you've asked, there's a large number of diseases that could potentially be approached with UPLIZNA to the real benefit of patients with unmet need far beyond the application of the prevailing CD20s that target just a subset of B-cells. This is not lost on our team, and we're working through indication expansion priorities presently."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.', 'Mohit Bansal', 'I have a question regarding the subcutaneous delivery of TEPEZZA. You do have plan to initiate a Phase III study. Can you talk a little bit about, I mean, which technology you are using? Is this with the preexisting Halozyme technology? Or are you using something else for this development?', 'Robert A. Bradway', 'Sorry, I had trouble understanding the question.', 'Murdo Gordon', ""The question is what technology we're using for the subcutaneous injectable form of TEPEZZA."", 'Justin Claeys', ""Maybe I'll just jump in. Mohit, we're not commenting at this point on the provider. We just said that we're going forward with the subcu."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.', 'Geoffrey Christopher Meacham', ""Another one on 133. When you think about the Phase III program, I just wanted to know what sort of informs the next indications you're going to go after? Is it unmet need? Is it the potential for differentiation on 133? And the timing of that, do you think that you'd want to have the Phase II data in hand? Or is this something that you could roll out sort at risk?"", 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Geoff. Really appreciate it. As you know, obesity is a major public health crisis, maybe 40% of Americans with a BMI over 30, massively costly, so huge burden to the global third-party payers and societies. The obesity-related disease list is quite long and expanding from cardiovascular disease and heart failure, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, NASH, NAFLD, kidney disease. These are chronic conditions that really demand medicines that can deliver durable and chronic weight loss. And so we think we have a really strong offering for these obesity-related diseases rising in our Phase II program, as you know. And obesity has a strong genetic component. And we locked on to the GIPR inhibition based on genetic insights. So the opportunity space is quite large. You asked the question what indications and perhaps even in what sequence. And when we have all the requisite data, we'll remark in due course. But we intend all indications where this dual mechanism can improve public health. And we are actively planning and on track for an expansive Phase III program."", 'Robert A. Bradway', 'And in terms of -- Dave, do you want to add the regulatory piece?', 'David M. Reese', ""Yes. I think -- Geoff, this is Dave Reese. I would just add that we're planning a very expansive Phase III program. So you can expect to see multiple indications move forward in parallel. And as Jay indicated, as we start to see data, we will begin launching those trials, and we'll discuss them. And then in addition, as you're aware, regulatory authorities around the world require a certain body of safety data before Phase III launches. And so of course, we will be compliant with that. But our goal is to launch Phase III as quickly as possible once we have the requisite data set and regulatory approval."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from David Risinger from Leerink Partners.', 'David Reed Risinger', 'So I have another question on AMG 133, please. Could you add some more color on your expectations for the impacts on blood pressure and lipids in Phase II, specifically whether you anticipate tirzepatide-like efficacy on those metrics?', 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. Thanks, David. I mean we're making all these measurements, and I'm not going to try to forecast the outcome of that pharmacology at this time. As you've seen in our Phase I program, the medicine is very well tolerated, delivering durable weight loss and benefit without significant excursion of some of those measurements. I just think it's too early to try to answer your question, and we'll have all that data at the end of the first part of Phase II towards the end of this calendar year."", 'David M. Reese', 'And the best extrapolation that you can have is from the preclinical data that were just published. I urge you to take a look at that.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim Securities.', 'Yige Guo', ""It's Yige on for Michael. A quick one on xaluritamig. Can you talk about your plan of data disclosure this year and your current thinking on the potential registration path? How do you think about the positioning of this agent relative to some of the other emerging agents based on different mechanisms such as ADC or AR degraders in prostate cancer?"", 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. Thanks for this outstanding question, Michael. And xaluritamig is a very interesting and exciting molecule. For those on the call, this is a STEAP1 CD3 bispecific. We have been studying this in advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We have expanded a cohort, the Phase I monotherapy. We're opening to reduced monitoring as well as, as you invoke, the existing and novel androgen receptor modulators integrators. We're exploring combinations with novel agents in that domain as well.The priorities for the program right now are to establish reduced monitoring. This will be important to reach just all the patients who can benefit. We're looking at the feasibility of reduced monitoring. We have great experience with these T-cell engaging bispecifics as well as the possibility of outpatient therapy.The approach to the regulatory path will present in due course. There will be no surprises there. The path to bring medicines to patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer alone and ultimately, in combination is well worn, thankfully, and we know how to deliver there.You asked about differentiation to other medicines. These are often apples-to-oranges comparisons. We have looked at that, of course, and we really like the offering of xaluritamig. The patients treated on our study had quite advanced disease, even more advanced disease than the demographics of the patients as reported on other mechanism medicines such as radioligand therapies. And the response rates we're seeing are really clinically meaningful to patients, and that gives us great encouragement to develop the medicine more ambitiously in the next few years."", 'Robert A. Bradway', 'Dave, in terms of the data sharing, do you want to share...', 'David M. Reese', ""Yes. In terms of data availability, as Jay mentioned, we're nearly complete in terms of dose expansion enrollment.

We'll get it looked at either later this year or early into next year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.', 'Timothy Minton Anderson', ""So Eli Lilly today made a couple of sets of comments about this topic of GIP agonism versus antagonism and they also weighed in on the data you published yesterday. And I'm wondering, in as much as you heard that or read those comments, is there any context to add or anything that's actually incorrect or anything to refute? Because they covered quite a few points, and they continue to express their view, which is agonism is the best way, not antagonism."", 'James E. Bradner', ""Tim, this is Jay. Open it up to anyone else who wants to contribute to this. I don't believe that engaging in the dialogue around this adds much to the narrative. Rather, I'd say that the argument for GIP receptor antagonism comes from just the highest level of scientific data. The human experience across populations with 1 million patients studied, among those who have variation in the genes associated with this pathway, where that variation is directionally inhibitory, the BMI is lower. And so we're hoping to replicate that pharmacology with this medicine. We feel great about the offering in this domain."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities.', 'Nicole Germino', 'This is Nicole on for Robyn.

Bradway', 'Sure. Jay and Dave?', 'James E. Bradner', ""Yes. Well, it's very early days with this medicine. There's a strong preclinical support from the published literature and our own preclinical work. It's, nicely for patients, a very competitive landscape, but this is the earliest phases of clinical investigation. And so we're going to approach this with total equipoise and bring the medicine to the patients that stand to benefit the best based on the biology underlying."", 'David M. Reese', ""Yes.

I just kind of want to piggyback on what Tim was alluding to. The GIP antagonism versus agonism, I'm looking at the Nature paper, it looks like 133's 420-milligram dose has a slight blip in triglycerides that eventually fades, but it does seem like antagonism is behaving a little differently from the literature for agonism. Is it too early to chalk it up to antagonism versus agonism in your view? Just wanted to get your thoughts there."", 'James E. Bradner', ""The short answer is it's too early to chalk it up to antagonism versus agonism. As I said before and I meant it, that these lipids are labile and indirect biomarker of this pharmacology.

As you heard, we're excited about the opportunities that we see for growing our business across all 4 of our pillars: general medicine, oncology, inflammation and rare disease. Last October, we shared an in-depth look at oncology in connection with the ESMO medical meeting. And we plan to do an introductory review of rare diseases and our rare disease pillar in late February to give you more information about the medicines that we already have on the market as well as some of those that are advancing through our pipeline. So we're encouraged by the questions that we heard on this call about those molecules, and we're excited about them and their prospects. So we'll host a call, which IR will share with you here over the next few days, and look forward to having that opportunity. In the meantime, again, thank you for your support, and we look forward to talking to you at the Rare Disease Day or at our first quarter results call.

Please go ahead.', 'Julie Mireille Cameron-Doe', 'Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings, Brian Gullbrants and Steve Weitman in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.', 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us again today. Well, what a quarter. And really what a year. Every single member of the Wynn team should be incredibly proud of what they achieved together in 2023. Momentum in the business built throughout the year, and we ended on a high note with $632 million (sic) [$630.4 million] of property EBITDAR, an all-time quarterly record, capping off a record year in which we generated nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDAR. We see tremendous value in our business as evidenced by our buybacks in the quarter and are genuinely looking forward to 2024. The company is more diversified than it's ever been. In Las Vegas, we continue to distance ourselves from peers as the leader in luxury and it's more evident than ever that we are the go-to spot for the best customers attending citywide events like F1. We have a growing business in Macau, that is running structurally higher margins than in the past, is much less reliant on the volatile VIP segment and is increasingly well positioned to compete. And importantly, we have a substantial growth opportunity in the UAE that will further diversify our portfolio and expand our brand into new markets. Turning to the quarter and starting here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $271 million of Adjusted Property EBITDAR, an all-time quarterly record, up 24% year-on-year on a very difficult comp. While F1 was clearly a contributor, activity of the property was intense throughout the quarter, with RevPAR table drop, slot handle and food and beverage revenue all well above what was a very strong quarter in 2022. In fact, we had our best October, our best November and our best December ever in terms of EBITDAR during Q4. We continue to fire on all cylinders here in Las Vegas, and I'm incredibly proud of the Vegas team. More recently, January 2024 looked a lot like January 2023 from an overall revenue perspective with hotel revenue particularly strong. That being said, January isn't where the action is this quarter. It's all about February. Super Bowl, Chinese New Year and for us, the best February in our history for group and convention. Between Super Bowl and Chinese New Year, we have doubled the front money and credit that we had in 2023, and we expect record hotel revenue over Super Bowl. So a very active February will really set the tone for the first quarter. Turning to Boston. Encore generated $64 million of EBITDAR during the quarter, similar to many other regional markets, demand at the property was largely stable year-on-year. Revenue decreased by about 0.5%, but the team has done a great job remaining disciplined on OpEx, driving a 2% year-over-year increase in EBITDAR. More recently, underlying demand has remained healthy through January although a couple of unfortunately timed winter storms had negatively impacted visitation during a few recent weekends. On the development across from Encore Boston Harbor, we recently received a key environmental approval and we are advancing through a few remaining items before construction can begin. Turning to Macau, we generated $297 million of EBITDAR in the quarter on market share that was consistent with the prior quarter and with 2019. While we held in the normal range in mass, we held a bit high in VIP. So on a fully normalized basis, EBITDAR would have been approximately $290 million or 94% of Q4 2019 levels. The strength in our business there has continued into Q1. In the casino, our mass drop per day in January increased 32% versus January 2019 and was up sequentially versus Q4. On the non-gaming side, our hotel occupancy was 99%, along with continued strength in tenant retail sales. Overall, strong top line performance, combined with disciplined OpEx control drove healthy margins during the month of January. On the development front, we opened our first major concession-related capital project during Q4, a collaboration with the team behind Las Vegas-based Illuminarium, and initial customer feedback has been positive. We are deep into design and planning for our other concession-related CapEx commitments, including our Destination Food Hall, the new event and entertainment center and a unique production show. Lastly, turning to Wynn Al Marjan, construction continues on the project with much of the hotel tower and podium foundation now complete, and we are nearly ready to start going vertical on the hotel tower. Property is really going to be a stunner, and it's great to see the buildings start to take shape. With that, I'll now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter."", 'Julie Mireille Cameron-Doe', ""Thank you, Craig. In Las Vegas, we generated $270.8 million in Adjusted Property EBITDAR and $696.8 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDAR margin of 38.9%, up 140 basis points year-on-year. Higher than novel table games hold benefited EBITDAR by around $10 million in Q4. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.4 million in Q4 '23, up 16% year-over-year, well below the 19% increase in revenue. The sequential increase in OpEx was primarily driven by higher programming and staffing costs related to F1. Turning to Boston, we generated adjusted property EBITDAR of $64.4 million on revenue of $217.1 million with an EBITDAR margin of 29.7%. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx, excluding gaming tax of $1.14 million per day in Q4 '23, down 2% year-over-year, driving a 70 basis point increase in EBITDAR margin. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience. Our Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $297 million in the quarter on $910.6 million of operating revenues. As Craig alluded to, we estimate higher-than-expected hold positively impacted EBITDAR by around $7 million during the quarter. Importantly, mass hold at both properties within the expected range during the quarter with the hold impact primarily related to the VIP side of the business. EBITDAR margin was 32.6% in the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points relative to Q4 2019, driven by a combination of the favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies. Our OpEx, excluding gaming tax was approximately $2.56 million per day in Q4, a decrease of 14% compared to $3 million in Q4 2019. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs and we're well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover. In terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4.5 billion as of December 31. This was comprised of $2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and approximately $2.45 billion in the U.S. Bringing it all together, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDAR in 2023. Together with our robust cash and liquidity position, creates a very healthy leverage and free cash flow profile for the company globally. Further, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on February 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of February 20, 2024. We also repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares to $139 million during the quarter, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders. We will consider additional dividend increases at Wynn Resorts and the initiation of the dividend from Wynn Macau as the recovery progresses and the exact timing of our global capital deployment plans become more clear. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $113 million, primarily related to the spa villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas, concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.', 'Carlo Santarelli', ""Guys, as you think about kind of Macau and obviously, with the amenities that come on, whether it's concession-related or other. Does this kind of 2.5 to 2.6 daily OpEx rate feel like you're in the right place going forward as we think about 2024, at least?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Carlo, I'll start and then I'll hand it to Julie. I mean, I think, we should put it in perspective, right. Our OpEx in the quarter was, I think, about 14% below Q4 2019, and our margins were some, I think, 140 basis points higher. So we're clearly being disciplined on OpEx. But Julie, do you want to discuss some specifics?"", 'Julie Mireille Cameron-Doe', ""Yes. There was some specifics, Carlo, sequentially. So if you think about it, it increased $160,000 per day or $15 million sequentially and that was split across 3 different buckets. The first one was higher variable costs on the extremely robust business volumes with hotel occupancy up 100 basis points; GGR up 12%, F&B up 13%. The second bucket really is payroll. We had more overtime pay related to holidays because there were 9 public holidays in the quarter versus just 2 in the previous quarter. And then the third bucket was really the highest spending on concession-related non-gaming events, because this was a particularly heavy event quarter. And you remember, we kind of foreshadowed that on the previous call when we talked about all the different programming we had going on. And that really kicked off with the Hypercar Exhibition that we had. And then we had several well-received sports and culinary events. So that's really what was driving it, the sequential pop. Going forward, we feel we've got -- as Craig said, with EBITDAR margin at both properties above Q4 '19 levels, and with the OpEx well controlled, we do expect the pace of growth in market-wide GGR along with our revenue mix to be a key driver of margins. So there's going to be some quarter-to-quarter variation as we see different programming coming through, and we continue to roll out the programming associated with concession commitments."", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Carlo, barring a major facility opening like the event center, which is a number of years away. I don't foresee a step change in our OpEx, and we're managing it very, very tightly."", 'Carlo Santarelli', 'Very helpful. Then just as a follow-up. Obviously, the Las Vegas results kind of speak for themselves, and it would be hard to notice anything changed in Las Vegas in the fourth quarter. But obviously, you guys do have a new competitor there to the north. And I was just wondering now with at least a couple of months of kind of experience with that. Could you talk a little bit perhaps about how Fontainebleau has kind of impacted positively or negatively the asset and kind of daily traffic.', 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Yes, it really hasn't. So I feel great about our business. We feel great about where we are. Like I said, February shaping up to be jampacked between the Super Bowl, Chinese New Year and everything else we have going on, I don't really see any impact."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Joe Greff with JPMorgan.', 'Joseph Richard Greff', ""Craig, in the fourth quarter, mass table GGR was 117% of fourth quarter levels, up from 106%. And in the 3Q relative to '19 or the 3Q of '19, I know you don't sort of think about it maybe or present it at least externally to the same degree that Las Vegas Sands does between how we define this premium mass and its base mass business. But when you think about within the different tiering that you guys have, would you say all of your mass table tiers are fully recovered plus relative to '19? Or are there some tiers that still have relative recovery to get to and exceed '19 levels?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""I think you have to differentiate between each of the properties. So the early portion of the recovery was clearly premium mass led. You saw that in the different -- the revenue per head or revenue per visitor in the early portion of the recovery. And clearly, we saw that hit Palace first. And so we've been talking for the past several quarters about how Wynn Macau would need a little bit longer to recover. And so at Wynn Palace, now it's really about yielding the rooms and driving the best heads and beds, if you will, in order to continue to grow our position there. And the property is well positioned to do that. At Wynn Macau, where we have historically been more reliance, on more transient traffic on what other operators may refer to as core mass. You saw that start to come through in this quarter. There's still more work to do there. But honestly, if you really look at the numbers that Wynn Macau produced this quarter, I'm incredibly proud of that team. You can see the uptick in drop. You can see the uptick in GGR, and it was incredibly strong. That's really down to the targeted CapEx that we did -- that we completed just at the end of the third quarter, bridging into the beginning of the fourth quarter and then also the return of those additional segments that you referred to in your question."", 'Joseph Richard Greff', ""And Craig, we heard your positive commentary about February and the 1Q in Las Vegas and in addition to the Super Bowl, the group traction, would you expect 2Q '24 through 4Q '24 group room nights to be up year-over-year?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', 'Yes. Brian, do you want to give a little bit more color?', 'Brian Gullbrants', ""Sure. Joe, as we're seeing this year play out, we're really encouraged by the forward group booking trends that we're seeing. The outlook for group business is super strong. '24 is pacing towards a record room night. So that base is there for us to yield from. And the sales and revenue teams continue to just do a great job in yield managing our properties. So..."", 'Joseph Richard Greff', ""And on those group [remains prime], what would you say rate is relative to '23 pricing?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""We don't disclose that, but you can assume that rates are contracted on a multiyear basis, and bear some relationship to CPI."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.', 'Shaun Clisby Kelley', ""Craig, maybe just starting and building off the answer to the last question on sort of the way the recoveries played out across the properties. Just specifically at Wynn Macau, is that the bigger beneficiary in the portfolio today as it relates to, let's call it, as we start to see visitation maybe outpace or balance out now relative to the spend per visit we saw, again, earlier in the recovery. Is that sort of the implication of the answer to the last question? Or could you just elaborate a little bit on where you expect to see some of the still very strong visitation numbers and that kind of catch up in the base mass business. Where should we see that most in your portfolio?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Well, I think you're going to see it across the portfolio, but you're going to see it disproportionately at Wynn Macau just based on the geographic location of the property. You tend to have that more transient customer in downtown, and we're going to be a beneficiary of that there. But it affects Palace as well. I mean, there's a lot of reasons to visit Palace and to make Palace a destination for a base mass customer. You should see the queue just to get on the gondola out in front of the lake every day. And now as we add incremental amenities like we did with Illuminarium, there's a lot of reasons to visit our property more so than they probably ever have been. So I would say it affects both properties to some extent, but I would expect it to disproportionately affect the property downtown."", 'Shaun Clisby Kelley', ""And then maybe as a Las Vegas question, obviously, some significant benefit on the event side from F1, which we know disproportionately seems like it accrued to win. You're going to have another big one, it seems like with Super Bowl. Wondering if you could comment a little bit on maybe as you look year-over-year, the broader events business in calendar, you talked about group. So how does the just broader event calendar post Super Bowl feel on a year-over-year basis? And then specifically, because we've got some tracking data that looks pretty good for you. Just any thoughts or comments on the impact of the spear? And how that has played out, especially on some of the bigger concert nights and what you might see in terms of impact there?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. On the first portion of your question, the event calendar looks pretty good because we spend a whole bunch of time creating our own events. So it's not just the city wise. We've been programming the heck out of this joint for several years now, and we've built a lot of momentum on doing that. And that not only helps us from a brand and marketing perspective, but clearly from a room night and a pricing on rooms perspective. So I feel great about the remainder of 2024 from an event perspective. With respect to the sphere, it's been -- I'd tell you, it's been pretty amazing. I mean it probably doesn't affect our rate, but we sure do get a whole bunch of requests to reside on that side of the building in order to see the sphere itself. And certainly, on the 2 weekends, we see an uptick in terms of very high-quality occupancy. So you're talking about kind of the best of the best customers that want to stay with us because we're actually the closest property to the sphere as the crow flies. So it's definitely been additive to us on the margin. And I got to tell you, I admire and respect what they've done by doing that. I think it's incredibly novel. It's incredibly unique, and it's yet another kind of only in Vegas experience that you can have, and we're delighted that they're next door."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next caller is Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.', 'Daniel Brian Politzer', 'So Vegas is obviously performing at an extremely high level, no real impact from new supply. How do you think about the parcel -- the property parcel in Wynn West that you have? And obviously, this is a longer-term focused question. But how did your thought process there maybe expand as it relates to your CapEx projects in the UAE as well as New York?', 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. I mean -- look, there's a lot -- we have a lot of different avenues for growth. We've got a huge land bank here in Vegas, right? We've got the land across the street. We've got the golf course. There's a lot that we can do here. We're in pursuit as I think everyone knows, in New York, we have a project that's actually coming out of the ground, in the UAE, and that's going to be a very substantial opportunity for us. There's some additional states that are moving, albeit at a relatively slow pace that might prove to be opportunities for us. We obviously don't do every possible -- every potential jurisdiction. We're very selective. And then there are certain international jurisdictions like Thailand, for example, that are also in the process of considering gaming. So we're always balancing really 2 things. Our ability to do what we do so well, remember, we're one of the last in the industry that maintains its own design and development group. And so it's not as though you can bang for these out in any particular year. So that's always a consideration. And then the other is capital, as you rightly pointed out. So we're always looking at what is the highest and best use of capital that we can deploy, and then we're making decisions accordingly. We will certainly make use of that land across the street in Las Vegas. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when, and we'll see how things play out in New York and things to play out in a couple of other jurisdictions in determining the timing of the use of that land."", 'Daniel Brian Politzer', ""And then just for my follow-up, right, Macau is certainly continuing along a nice trajectory here. You outlined some CapEx as you think about it related to the concession renewals. But how do you balance that with maybe the subsidiary paying up dividends to the parent. Is that something that we could see within the next 12 to 18 months? Or is that something longer term that you'd like to envision coming back?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Yes. It really depends -- you're right. There's a lot of moving parts there, right? We have a debt maturity later this year there. We need to think about our leverage profile in Macau. And what that longer-term leverage profile should be. We have some capital that we need to put in the ground there. We had nearly 3 years of closure and cash burn. So the question is, what do we want the balance sheet to be? How will the CapEx plans come together in terms of the timing of capital deployment, which we're studying and learning more about as we go through the design and development process every day. And then, of course, the dividend. And as you know, the dividend just as a global statement, dividends are the cornerstone of our capital return strategy. So stay tuned. We are looking very closely at it, and we'll figure it out in due course."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Robin Farley with UBS.', 'Robin Margaret Farley', ""I wanted to ask about Vegas. It sounds like clearly, very strong events calendar and outlook for February. Your January comments sounded like it was maybe a little bit flattish year-over-year. I'm just wondering how much is looking on kind of a year-over-year basis when you get past some of the big events in Feb?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure, Robin. Yes, January -- well, keep in mind, last year, Chinese New Year started in January. And so this year, it starts in February. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, February really sets the tone for the quarter, and it's where all the action is this year in Q1. March has a couple of headwinds. Easter timing is one of them, and then the [CONEXPO-CON/AGG] is another. But our forward booking indicators continue to look strong, and we feel good about it. I've said probably 5 times on the last 3 or 4 calls that trees don't grow to the sky, and I would continue to tell you how things are looking in Vegas, and they continue to look good. We continue to look good for us. So how the quarter plays out, we'll be very dependent on February. And again, all forward indicators look strong for February. But subsequent to that, we'll take it from there."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Brandt Montour with Barclays.', 'Brandt Antoine Montour', ""In Macau and Palace, I guess, specifically, but these are -- it's a broader question. Can you comment on just the broader competitive environment for premium mass players. How it's evolved sort of into the end of the year and into the early part of this year, which with volumes being strong, infrastructure, travel and infrastructure going back, how has that changed? And is that a tailwind for you as we go forward here and as volumes continue to grow?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. Specifically as it relates to Wynn Palace, Wynn Palace is incredibly well positioned. And it has been since the day it opens, [I quote that] but it only grows more so as we continue to evolve the amenities in Wynn Palace. Competition for premium mass customers has been fierce forever end today. So it's really nothing new. What we try to do is really focus on what we do well, stay true to who we are and be really, really disciplined, including on reinvestment because at the end of the day, I don't think the bank takes market share. I think they take cash. And so we're really focused on generating cash and EBITDAR. So I think Palace turned in a great quarter, its future is bright, and we will continue to aggressively chase market share responsibly."", 'Operator', 'Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley.', 'Stephen White Grambling', 'I may have missed this, but I guess how are you thinking about looking currently at the Super Bowl, how that might compare to Formula 1? Or is there any way to kind of back out how you think about the contribution from Formula 1 in the quarter and how that might grow next year?', 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Yes, it's a really good question. The Super Bowl is distinctly more corporate in terms of visitation. And so I think that's an important point to keep in mind. So we have -- I alluded to it actually explicitly stated in my prepared remarks, we have very strong front money and credit for Super Bowl about double what we had last year. And that will be a very important segment of our business over the course of the next week, and I expect it will generate very strong results. We also have a lot of folks in house who will never go near a gaming table because there's a lot of corporate visitation around this particular event. So the real answer to your question is, we don't know. We're going to see. But if we had to spitball it now, what I would say is that it's not going to be as impactful in the casino, and it will be equally, if not more impactful when it comes to hotel revenue. Fair assessment, Brian?"", 'Brian Gullbrants', ""Yes, both hotel revenues and rates are very similar to Formula One. The weekend Super Bowl event is another great match, I think, for our brand. And as you said, we're going to have double the credit and track money we had previously. So I think we're in for a great weekend here."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is John DeCree with CBRE.', 'John G. DeCree', ""Maybe 2 follow-ups. One is on F1, and we've had some conversations. This was the first year, obviously, quite successful for you. Curious how you think about next year and going forward? Is there opportunities to calibrate event and see growth and build upon this? Or do you have a view that's the first one in Vegas might be the best. We've had some different folks, different opinions about that, whether next year is a tough comp or an opportunity perhaps to just continue to grow that event for you and for the city?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Yes. Great question. I guess I'll answer that as a Las Vegan and someone who cares about the broader market and wanting to see everybody in the market participate and do really well. There's clearly -- I mean, look, the first time you do anything of this scale, you're going to have learnings. And it's just natural. And so I do think that there's a lot that can be done to make the event more relevant for the town more broadly. And I think that F1 understands that. And I think, frankly, the operators in town understand that, even those like us who disproportionately benefited. So I think the event is only going to get better and better. I think what this year proved is that the core contingent of people that travel to go to an F1 race is our customer. And so you better believe that we will program the heck out of this place yet again, just like we did this F1 -- this last F1, this coming year, and we will do our best to attract the best customers in the market. And hopefully, again, there will be more opportunities for some of the other tiers of properties in the market to participate in the event this year as they continue to evolve and change the event."", 'John G. DeCree', ""Maybe one more top down on the other side of the world in Macau. We still hear from investors skittish about some of the uncertainty around the macroeconomic picture in China yet. We continue to see monthly numbers out of Macau and your performance things just continue to recover and grow. Curious if you want to take a stab or someone of the team to kind of weigh in on how Macau's kind of fundamental recovery has been decoupled from that. And what you're kind of seeing that it gives some confidence that the recovery trend continues. And if you have any top-down high-level comments, it would be helpful."", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Yes. I'll leave the detailed China macro analysis to people who do that for a living. But there's certainly a lot of crosscurrents to consider. You have tremendous pent-up demand still from several years of mirror closure. You have the ease of proximity to Macau, which actually benefits Macau when the economic situation perhaps isn't as robust as it could be. And you have some modest stimulus efforts that we've seen. But you -- also, as you rightly pointed out, clearly, have a litany of difficult economic indicators. Yet Macau continues to tread along. So to us, it's really the long-term viability of Macau. We're thinking in kind of 5-, 10-year increments. So it's really the long-term viability of Macau that's most relevant. And we're clearly already at levels that allow us the financial and operating flexibility to plan for that longer-term time horizon. So I think it's well observed, maybe not well understood, but well observed that Macau's trajectory does seem to be decoupled from the broader China macro. I think you saw that in 2009 as well. And I think that bodes well for the future. Does it bode well for next quarter? I don't know. Does it bode well for the quarter after that? I don't know. But it certainly bodes well for the future, and that's what we're thinking about."", 'Julie Mireille Cameron-Doe', 'Thank you, John. And operator, the next caller will be -- the next question will be our last.', 'Operator', 'And our final question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.', 'Chad C. Beynon', ""Just to kind of pile in on that Macau question. Wondering if you could elaborate a little bit in terms of the health of the shopping retail market, that's something that we've heard from the luxury operators continues to be strong in specific markets. Wondering how you're seeing that right now. And then as some of the catchment areas recover in terms of visitation, if that could be an additional tailwind in the future."", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. I guess what I would say is if you look at the trajectory over the course of 2023, retail sales have been and were incredibly strong in Macau, up over 2019. You saw -- you can see -- you can look at our numbers, Q3 to Q4, you can see that they were up very, very modestly, I think, about 10 basis points. And so certainly, if anything from China macro is affecting Macau is probably there. But again, given the relative strength compared to pre-COVID, I think it's difficult for us to complain. I think what appears to us to be occurring is, to a certain extent, Macau has become a substitute for Hong Kong from a retail sales perspective. And certainly, based on the changing type of visitation that you see, particularly on Cotai, I think you can support that premise. And so I think it's -- again, if you look at the long term, I think it's very bright for Macau from that perspective. And I think to the extent that someone goes to Macau with a retail-based motivation and the gaming-based motivation or eventually a retail-based motivation and entertainment-based motivation, that's fine. That's great. I mean that's a natural evolution of Macau. But you can see the quarter-over-quarter changes in our numbers."", 'Chad C. Beynon', 'Perfect. And then in terms of the interactive business, is there any update to speak about? Or could there be an opportunity to monetize or partner this in a shareholder-friendly way?', 'Julie Mireille Cameron-Doe', ""I'll take that one. Thanks, Chad. Yes, so we announced in August that we were exiting the jurisdictions we operate in, and we were leaving New York and Michigan under review. So we're continuing to -- that strategic review of those 2 states, and we'll stay tuned. We'll have more information on that in the future. Everywhere else is pretty much wrapped up now. We've just -- we're working on closing down Massachusetts online as well. And wherever we're able to and where we can interact with anybody else, obviously, with a quick player databases and so on. We'll make sure that we do the best for our shareholders and monetize the assets that we have in a way that works well with what's allowed and what's available out there in the market. With that, we'll close the call. Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter."", 'Operator', ""Thank you for participating on today's conference call. You may now go ahead and disconnect.""]"

I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true.', 'I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Wynn Resorts right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Wynn Resorts, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Wynn Resorts wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has\xa0more than tripled\xa0the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.', 'See the 10 stocks', '*Stock Advisor returns as of February 5, 2024', 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us again today. Well, what a quarter. And really what a year. Every single member of the Wynn team should be incredibly proud of what they achieved together in 2023.', ""Momentum in the business built throughout the year, and we ended on a high note with $632 million of property EBITDA, an all-time quarterly record, capping off a record year in which we generated nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDA. We see tremendous value in our business as evidenced by our buybacks in the quarter and I'm genuinely looking forward to 2024. The company is more diversified than it's ever been. In Las Vegas, we continue to distance ourselves from peers as the leader in luxury and it's more evident than ever that we are the go-to spot for the best customers attending citywide events like F1."", 'We have a growing business in Macau that is running structurally higher margins than in the past, is much less reliant on the volatile VIP segment and is increasingly well positioned to compete. And importantly, we have a substantial growth opportunity in the UAE that will further diversify our portfolio and expand our brand into new markets. Turning to the quarter and starting here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $271 million of adjusted property EBITDA, an all-time quarterly record, up 24% year-on-year on a very difficult comp.', ""While F1 was clearly a contributor, activity of the property was intense throughout the quarter, with RevPAR table drop, slot handle and food and beverage revenue all well above what was a very strong quarter in 2022. In fact, we had our best October, our best November, and our best December ever in terms of EBITDA during Q4. We continue to fire on all cylinders here in Las Vegas, and I'm incredibly proud of the Vegas team. More recently, January 2024 looked a lot like January 2023 from an overall revenue perspective with hotel revenue particularly strong."", ""That being said, January isn't where the action is this quarter. It's all about February. Super Bowl, Chinese New Year and for us, the best February in our history for group and convention. Between Super Bowl and Chinese New Year, we have doubled the front money and credit that we had in 2023, and we expect record hotel revenue over Super Bowl."", 'So a very active February will really set the tone for the first quarter. Turning to Boston. Encore generated $64 million of EBITDAR during the quarter, similar to many other regional markets, demand at the property was largely stable year-on-year. Revenue decreased by about 0.5%, but the team has done a great job remaining disciplined on opex, driving a 2% year-over-year increase in EBITDAR.', 'More recently, underlying demand has remained healthy through January although a couple of unfortunately timed winter storms had negatively impacted visitation during a few recent weekends. On the development across from Encore Boston Harbor, we recently received a key environmental approval and we are advancing through a few remaining items before construction can begin. Turning to Macau. We generated $297 million of EBITDA in the quarter on market share that was consistent with the prior quarter and with 2019.', 'While we held in the normal range in mass, we held a bit high in VIP. So on a fully normalized basis, EBITDA would have been approximately $290 million or 94% of Q4 2019 levels. The strength in our business there has continued into Q1. In the casino, our mass drop per day in January increased 32% versus January 2019 and was up sequentially versus Q4.', 'On the non-gaming side, our hotel occupancy was 99%, along with continued strength in tenant retail sales. Overall, strong top line performance, combined with disciplined opex control drove healthy margins during the month of January. On the development front, we opened our first major concession-related capital project during Q4, a collaboration with the team behind Las Vegas-based Illuminarium and initial customer feedback has been positive. We are deep into design and planning for our other concession-related capex commitments, including our Destination Food Hall, the new event and entertainment center and a unique production show.', ""Lastly, turning to Wynn Al Marjan, construction continues on the project with much of the hotel tower and podium foundation now complete, and we are nearly ready to start going vertical on the hotel tower. Property is really going to be a stunner, and it's great to see the buildings start to take shape. With that, I'll now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter."", 'Julie Cameron-Doe -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $270.8 million in adjusted property EBITDA on $696.8 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDA margin of 38.9%, up 140 basis points year on year. Higher than novel table games hold benefited EBITDA by around $10 million in Q4. Opex, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.4 million in Q4'23, up 16% year over year, well below the 19% increase in revenue."", ""The sequential increase in opex was primarily driven by higher programming and staffing costs related to F1. Turning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDA of $64.4 million on revenue of $217.1 million with an EBITDA margin of 29.7%. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with opex, excluding gaming tax of $1.14 million per day in Q4'23, down 2% year over year, driving a 70 basis point increase in EBITDA margin."", 'The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience. Our Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDA of $297 million in the quarter on $910.6 million of operating revenues. As Craig alluded to, we estimate higher-than-expected hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $7 million during the quarter. Importantly, mass hold at both properties within the expected range during the quarter with the hold impact primarily related to the VIP side of the business.', ""EBITDA margin was 32.6% in the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points relative to Q4 2019, driven by a combination of the favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies. Our opex, excluding gaming tax was approximately $2.56 million per day in Q4, a decrease of 14% compared to $3 million in Q4 2019. The team has done a great job remaining disciplined on costs and we're well positioned to continue to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover. In terms of capex in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on our concession commitments."", 'And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential capex outcomes in the near term. As such, we expect capex related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4.5 billion as of December 31.', 'This was comprised of $2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and approximately $2.45 billion in the US. Bringing it all together, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating nearly $2.2 billion of property EBITDA in 2023. Together with our robust cash and liquidity position, creates a very healthy leverage and free cash flow profile for the company globally. Further, the board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on February 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of February 20, 2024.', 'We also repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares, $139 million during the quarter, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders. We will consider additional dividend increases at Wynn Resorts and the initiation of the dividend from Wynn Macau as the recovery progresses and the exact timing of our global capital deployment plans become more clear. Finally, our capex in the quarter was $113 million, primarily related to the spa villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas concession-related capex in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A.', '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.', 'Carlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Hey, Craig. Hey, Julie, everyone. Guys, as you think about kind of Macau and obviously, with the amenities that come on, whether it's concession-related or other. Does this kind of 2.5 to 2.6 daily opex rate feel like you're in the right place going forward as we think about 2024, at least?"", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey, Carlo, I'll start and then I'll hand it to Julie. I mean, I think, we should put it in perspective, right. Our opex in the quarter was, I think, about 14% below Q4 2019, and our margins were some, I think, 140 basis points higher. So we're clearly being disciplined on opex."", 'But Julie, do you want to discuss some specifics?', 'Julie Cameron-Doe -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah, there were some specifics, Carlo, sequentially. So if you think about it, it increased 160,000 per day or $15 million sequentially and that was split across three different buckets. The first one was higher variable costs on the extremely robust business volumes with hotel occupancy up 100 basis points, GGR up 12%, F&B up 13%. The second bucket really is payroll.', 'We had more overtime pay related to holidays because there were nine public holidays in the quarter versus just two in the previous quarter. And then, the third bucket was really the highest spending on concession-related non-gaming events, because this was a particularly heavy event quarter. And you remember, we kind of foreshadowed that in the previous call when we talked about all the different programming we had going on. And that really kicked off with the hypercar exhibition that we had.', ""And then, we had several well-received art, sports and culinary events. So that's really what was driving it, the sequential pop. Going forward, we feel, you know we've got -- as Craig said, with EBITDA margin at both properties above Q4'19 levels and with the opex well controlled. We do expect the pace of growth in marketwide GGR along with our revenue mix to be a key driver of margins."", ""So there's going to be some quarter-to-quarter variation as we see different programming coming through and we continue to roll out the programming associated with concession commitments."", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Barring, Carlo, barring a major facility opening like the event center, which is a number of years away. I don't foresee a step change in our opex, and we're managing it very, very tightly."", 'Carlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Very helpful. Thank you for the detail as well. Then just as a follow-up. Obviously, the Las Vegas results kind of speak for themselves, and it would be hard to notice anything changed in Las Vegas in the fourth quarter.', 'But obviously, you guys do have a new competitor there to the north. And I was just wondering now with at least a couple of months of kind of experience with that. Could you talk a little bit perhaps about how Fontainebleau has kind of impacted positively or negatively the asset and kind of daily traffic.', 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, it really hasn't. So I feel great about our business. I feel great about where we are. Like I said, February is shaping up to be jampacked between the Super Bowl, Chinese New Year and everything else we have going on, I don't really see any impact."", 'Carlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you, both.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next caller is Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan.', 'Joe Greff -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst', ""Hi, everyone. Thanks. Craig, in the fourth quarter, mass table GGR was 117% of fourth quarter levels, up from 106% in the 3Q relative to '19 or 3Q of '19. I know you don't sort of think about it maybe or present it at least externally to the same degree that Las Vegas Sands does between how we define this premium mass and its base mass business."", ""But when you think about within the different tiering that you guys have? Would you say all of your mass table tiers are fully recovered plus relative to '19? Or are there some tiers that still have relative recovery to get to and exceed '19 levels?"", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Joe. I think you have to differentiate between each of the properties. So the early portion of the recovery was clearly premium mass land. You saw that in the different -- the revenue per head or revenue per visitor in the early portion of the recovery.', ""And clearly, we saw that hit Palace first. And so, we've been talking for the past several quarters about how Wynn Macau would need a little bit longer to recover. And so, at Wynn Palace, now it's really about yielding the rooms and driving the best heads and beds, if you will, in order to continue to grow our position there. And the property is well positioned to do that."", ""At Wynn Macau, where we have historically been more reliant on more transient traffic on what other operator may refer to as core mass. You saw that start to come through in this quarter. There's still more work to do there. But honestly, if you really look at the numbers that Wynn Macau produced this quarter, I'm incredibly proud of that team."", ""You can see the uptick in drop. You can see the uptick in GGR and it was incredibly strong. That's really down to the targeted capex that we did that we completed just at the end of the third quarter, bridging into the beginning of the fourth quarter and then also the return of those additional segments that you referred to in your question."", 'Joe Greff -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst', ""Great. That's helpful. And Craig, we heard your positive commentary about February and the 1Q in Las Vegas and in addition to the Super Bowl, the group traction. Would you expect 2Q '24 through 4Q'24 group room nights to be up year over year?"", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Brian, do you want to give a little bit more color?', 'Brian Gullbrants -- Chief Operating Officer, North America Wynn Resorts', ""Sure. Joe, as we're seeing this year play out, we're really encouraged by the forward group booking trends that we're seeing. The outlook for group business is super strong. '24 is pacing toward a record room night."", 'So that base is there for us to yield from. And the sales and revenue teams continue to just do a great job in yield managing our properties.', 'Joe Greff -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst', ""And on those group room nights, Brian, what would you say rate is relative to '23 pricing?"", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""We don't disclose that, but you can assume that rates are contracted on a multiyear basis and bear some relationship to CPI."", 'Joe Greff -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next caller is Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. You may go ahead.', 'Shaun Kelley -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Craig, maybe just starting and building off the answer to the last question on sort of the way the recovery has played out across the properties. Just specifically at Wynn Macau, is that the bigger beneficiary in the portfolio today as it relates to, let's call it, as we start to see visitation maybe outpace or balance out now relative to the spend per visit we saw, again, earlier in the recovery."", 'Is that sort of the implication of the answer to the last question? Or could you just elaborate a little bit on where you expect to see some of the still very strong visitation numbers and that kind of catch up in the base mass business. Where should we see that most in your portfolio?', 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, I think you're going to see it across the portfolio, but you're going to see it disproportionately at Wynn Macau just based on the geographic location of the property. You tend to have that more transient customer in downtown and we're going to be a beneficiary of that there. But it affects Palace as well. I mean, there's a lot of reasons to visit Palace and to make Palace a destination for a base mass customer."", ""You should see the queue just to get on the gondola out in front of the lake every day. And now as we add incremental amenities like we did with Illuminarium, there's a lot of reasons to visit our property more so than they probably ever have been. So I would say it affects both properties to some extent, but I would expect it to disproportionately affect the property downtown."", 'Shaun Kelley -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Thank you for that. And then, maybe as a Las Vegas, question. Obviously, some significant benefit on the event side from F1, which we know disproportionately seems like it accrued to win. You're going to have another big one, it seems like with Super Bowl."", ""Wondering if you could comment a little bit on maybe as you look year over year, the broader events business in calendar, you talked about group. So how does the just broader event calendar post Super Bowl feel on a year-over-year basis? And then, specifically, because we've got some tracking data that looks pretty good for you. Just any thoughts or comments on the impact of the sphere? And how that has played out, especially on some of the bigger concert nights and what you might see in terms of impact there? Thanks."", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. On the first portion of your question, the event calendar looks pretty good because we spend a whole bunch of time creating our own events. So it's not just the city wides. We've been programming the heck out of this joint for several years now, and we've built a lot of momentum on doing that."", ""And that not only helps us from a brand and marketing perspective, but clearly from a room night and a pricing on rooms perspective. So I feel great about the remainder of 2024 from an events perspective. With respect to the sphere, it's been, I'd tell you, it's been pretty amazing. I mean, it probably doesn't affect our rate, but we sure do get a whole bunch of requests to reside on that side of the building in order to see the sphere itself."", ""And certainly, on the U2 weekends, we see an uptick in terms of very high-quality occupancy. So you're talking about kind of the best of the best customers that want to stay with us because we're actually the closest property to the sphere as the crow flies. So it's definitely been additive to us on the margin. And I got to tell you, I admire and respect what they've done by doing that."", ""I think it's incredibly novel. It's incredibly unique, and it's yet another kind of only in Vegas experience that you can have and we're delighted that they're next door."", 'Shaun Kelley -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next caller is Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead, sir.', 'Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Look, Vegas is obviously performing at an extremely high level, no real impact from new supply.', 'How do you think about the parcel -- the property parcel Wynn West that you have? And obviously, this is a longer-term focused question, but how did your thought process there maybe expand as it relates to your capex projects in the UAE, as well as New York? Thanks.', 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I mean, look, there's a lot -- we have a lot of different avenues for growth. We've got a huge land bank here in Vegas, right? We've got the land across the street. We've got the golf course."", ""There's a lot that we can do here. We're in pursuit as I think everyone knows, in New York, we have a project that's actually coming out of the ground in the UAE, and that's going to be a very substantial opportunity for us. There's some additional states that are moving, albeit at a relatively slow pace that might prove to be opportunities for us. We obviously don't do every possible -- every potential jurisdiction."", ""We're very selective. And then, there are certain international jurisdictions like Thailand, for example, that are also in the process of considering gaming. So we're always balancing really two things. Our ability to do what we do so well, remember, we're one of the last in the industry that maintains its own design and development group."", ""And so, it's not as though you can bang for these out in any particular year. So that's always a consideration. And then, the other is capital, as you rightly pointed out. So we're always looking at what is the highest and best use of capital that we can deploy, and then we're making decisions accordingly."", ""We will certainly make use of that land across the street in Las Vegas. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when, and we'll see how things play out in New York and things play out in a couple of other jurisdictions in determining the timing of the use of that land."", 'Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Got it. And then, just for my follow-up, right, Macau is certainly continuing along a nice trajectory here. You outlined some capex as you think about it related to the concession renewals. But how do you balance that with maybe the subsidiary paying up dividends to the parent.', ""Is that something that we could see within the next 12 to 18 months? Or is that something longer term that you'd like to envision coming back?"", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. It really depends, you're right. There's a lot of moving parts there, right? We have a debt maturity later this year there. We need to think about our leverage profile in Macau."", ""And what that longer-term leverage profile should be. We have some capital that we need to put in the ground there. We had nearly three years of closure and cash burn. So the question is, what do we want the balance sheet to be? How will the capex plans come together in terms of the timing of capital deployment, which we're studying and learning more about as we go through the design and development process every day."", ""And then, of course, the dividend. And as you know, the dividend just as a global statement, dividends are the cornerstone of our capital return strategy. So stay tuned. We are looking very closely at it, and we'll figure it out in due course."", 'Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thanks, and congrats on the quarter.', 'Julie Cameron-Doe -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Robin Farley with UBS.', 'Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about Vegas. It sounds like clearly very strong events calendar and outlook for February.', ""Your January comments sounded like it was maybe a little bit flattish year over year. I'm just wondering how much is looking on kind of a year-over-year basis when you get past some of these big events in Feb? Thanks."", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure, Robin. Yes, January, well, keep in mind, last year, Chinese New Year started in January. And so, this year, it starts in February. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, February really sets the tone for the quarter, and it's where all the action is this year in Q1."", ""March has a couple of headwinds. Easter timing is one of them and then the absence of CON/AGG is another. But our forward booking indicators continue to look strong, and we feel good about it. I've said probably five times on the last three or four calls that trees don't grow to the sky, and I would continue to tell you how things are looking in Vegas, and they continue to look good."", ""They continue to look good for us. So how the quarter plays out will be very dependent on February. And again all forward indicators look strong for February. But subsequent to that, we'll take it from there."", 'Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst', 'OK. Great. Thank you very much.', 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next caller is Brandt Montour with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir.', 'Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Good evening, everybody, and congrats on the results. In Macau and Palace, I guess, specifically, but these are -- it's a broader question. Can you comment on just the broader competitive environment for premium mass players, how it's evolved sort of into the early part of this year, which with volumes being strong, infrastructure, travel infrastructure going back, how has that changed? And is that a tailwind for you as we go forward here and as volumes continue to grow?"", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. Specifically as it relates to Wynn Palace. Wynn Palace is incredibly well positioned and has been since the day it opens Encore time. But it only grows more so as we continue to evolve the amenities in Wynn Palace.', ""Competition for premium mass customers has been fierce for ever end of day. So it's really nothing new. What we try to do is really focus on what we do well, stay true to who we are and be really, really disciplined, including on reinvestment because at the end of the day, I don't think the bank takes market share. I think they take cash."", ""And so, we're really focused on generating cash and EBITDA. So I think Palace turned in a great quarter, its future is bright, and we will continue to aggressively chase market share responsibly."", 'Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead, sir.', 'Stephen Grambling -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Hey. Thank you. I may have missed this, but I guess how are you thinking about looking currently at the Super Bowl, how that might compare to Formula 1? Is there any way to kind of back out how you think about the contribution from Formula 1 in the quarter and how that might grow next year?', 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, it's a really good question. The Super Bowl is distinctly more corporate in terms of visitation. And so, I think that's an important point to keep in mind. So we have -- I alluded to it actually explicitly stated in my prepared remarks, we have very strong front money and credit for Super Bowl about double what we had last year."", ""And that will be a very important segment of our business over the course of the next week and I expect it will generate very strong results. We also have a lot of folks in house who will never go near a gaming table because there's a lot of corporate visitation around this particular event. So the real answer to your question is, we don't know. We're going to see."", ""But if we had to spitball it now, what I would say is that it's not going to be as impactful in the casino, and it will be equally, if not more impactful when it comes to hotel revenue. Fair assessment, Brian?"", 'Brian Gullbrants -- Chief Operating Officer, North America Wynn Resorts', ""Yeah, both hotel revenues and rates are very similar to Formula 1. The weekend Super Bowl event is another great match, I think, for our brand. And as you said, we're going to have double the credit and track money we had previously. So I think we're in for a great weekend here."", 'Stephen Grambling -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks so much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next caller is John DeCree with CBRE.', 'John DeCree -- CBRE -- Analyst', ""Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe two follow-ups. One is on F1, and we've had some conversations."", ""This was the first year, obviously, quite successful for you. Curious how you think about next year and going forward? Is there opportunities to calibrate event and see growth and build upon this? Or do you have a view that the first one in Vegas might be the best. We've had some different folks, different opinions about that, whether next year is a tough comp or an opportunity perhaps to just continue to grow that event for you and for the city?"", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Great question. I guess I'll answer that as a Las Vegan and someone who cares about the broader market and wanting to see everybody in the market participate and do really well. There's clearly, I mean, look, the first time you do anything of this scale, you're going to have learnings."", ""And it's just natural. And so, I do think that there's a lot that can be done to make the event more relevant for the town more broadly. And I think that F1 understands that. And I think, frankly, the operators in town understand that."", 'Even those like us who disproportionately benefited. So I think the event is only going to get better and better. I think what this year approved is that the core contingent of people that travel to go to an F1 race is our customer. And so, you better believe that we will program the heck out of this place yet again, just like we did this F1, this last F1 this coming year, and we will do our best to attract the best customers in the market.', 'And hopefully, again, there will be more opportunities for some of the other tiers of properties in the market to participate in the event this year as they continue to evolve and change the event.', 'John DeCree -- CBRE -- Analyst', ""Thanks, Craig. That's helpful. Maybe one more top down on the other side of the world in Macau. We still hear from investors skittish about some of the uncertainty around the macroeconomic picture in China yet."", ""We continue to see monthly numbers out of Macau and your performance things just continue to recover and grow. Curious if you want to take a stab or someone of the team to kind of weigh in on how Macau's kind of fundamental recovery has been decoupled from that? What you're kind of seeing that it gives some confidence that the recovery trend continues. And if you have any top-down high level comments? It would be helpful."", 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, I'll leave the detailed China macro analysis to people who do that for a living. But there's certainly a lot of crosscurrents to consider. You have tremendous pent-up demand still from several years of mirror closure. You have the ease of proximity to Macau, which actually benefits Macau when the economic situation perhaps isn't as robust as it could be."", ""And you have some modest stimulus efforts that we've seen. But you also, as you rightly pointed out, clearly, have a litany of difficult economic indicators. Yet Macau continues to tread along. So to us, it's really the long-term viability of Macau."", ""We're thinking in kind of five, 10-year increments. So it's really the long-term viability of Macau that's most relevant. And we're clearly already at levels that allow us the financial and operating flexibility to plan for that longer-term time horizon. So I think it's well observed, maybe not well understood, but well observed that Macau's trajectory does seem to be decoupled from the broader China macro."", ""I think you saw that in 2009 as well. And I think that bodes well for the future. Does it bode well for next quarter? I don't know. Does it bode well for the quarter after that? I don't know."", ""But it certainly bodes well for the future, and that's what we're thinking about."", 'John DeCree -- CBRE -- Analyst', 'Thanks for the -- that long term outlook is great perspective. I really appreciate it. Congratulations on the quarter.', 'Craig Billings -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Julie Cameron-Doe -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, John. And operator, the next call will be -- the next question will be our last.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our final question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. You may go ahead, sir.', 'Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Group -- Analyst', 'Afternoon. Nice results. Thanks for taking my question. Just to kind of pile in on that Macau question.', ""Wondering if you could elaborate a little bit in terms of the health of the shopping retail market. That's something that we've heard from the luxury operators continues to be strong in specific markets. Wondering how you're seeing that right now.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more."", 'While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon ', ""The insider, Catherine Keating, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.7m worth of shares at a price of US$55.01 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$55.27). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 45% of Catherine Keating's holding."", ""Bank of New York Mellon insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all."", ""For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.1% of Bank of New York Mellon shares, worth about US$56m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders."", ""Insiders haven't bought Bank of New York Mellon stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Bank of New York Mellon is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

That far surpassed analysts’ projections of $778 million. Earnings will be roughly 30 cents, excluding some items, well ahead of Wall Street’s 21-cent estimate.', 'Arm’s technology is going into an ever-widening array of products, from phones to cars to appliances. The scramble to add AI technology promises to accelerate that expansion, Haas said. In some cases, electronics makers don’t yet know how they’ll fully harness AI — they just want to make sure they have enough computing capacity to handle whatever is coming.', 'Arm once concentrated on technology for smartphones, but now that market accounts for about a third of sales. Phones today also contain more of the company’s technology per device, helping lift the royalties that manufacturers pay to Arm.', '“This is the result of strategies that were put in place a number of years ago that are coming to fruition,” Haas said in the interview. “A lot of folks didn’t really understand the company well and where we fit in: But we’re in a Tesla vehicle, a Ford F-150, we are in a smart camera, a Samsung TV, the smart appliances.”', 'Arm’s bullish outlook, delivered late Wednesday, helped send the shares on their biggest single-day rally since an initial public offering last September. The stock closed at $113.89, adding tens of billions of dollars to Arm’s market valuation.', 'Another tailwind: The company’s customers are shifting to a new version of its technology called V9, which carries twice the royalty rate of its predecessors. They’re also using more Arm computing cores per device — more than 100 in Microsoft Corp.’s new server chips, for example — which amplifies royalties. Arm is also gaining market share from rival technology in the data-center and automotive markets, executives said.', 'Arm now expects sales of $3.16 billion to $3.21 billion in fiscal 2024, which runs through March.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on smart travel planning and availing hotel discounts through AARP, you can go to 5 Big Hotels Where AARP Members Can Get Discounted Rates. ', 'For seniors on fixed incomes looking to travel, strategic planning can go quite a long way. In this regard, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), a prominent American travel technology company, has a noteworthy insight to share: international flights can be remarkably more affordable when booked on a Sunday rather than a Friday. The potential savings, reaching up to 14%, can serve to be a significant advantage for seniors managing a fixed budget as they embark on their travel adventures. Moreover, the optimal time to book a flight, says Expedia, is an estimated five to six months before the travel date, implying that it is best to book in advance to reap the most savings.', ""This hack is noteworthy for seniors looking to travel more since 2023. Despite not having substantial savings—often with a median of around $200,000—these individuals are driven by a strong desire to travel post-retirement. According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), an interest group dedicated to people over 50, Americans aged 50-plus are making traveling a top priority since 2023. While saving on cost is a must, travel is definitely on the agenda for these young-at-heart individuals. The AARP survey notes that three out of five individuals aged 50 and over have shared travel plans in 2023, similar to 2022. The upcoming year is anticipated to follow a similar pattern, and if opportunities for discounts present themselves, who wouldn't want to seize the chance to make the most of this exhilarating chapter in their lives?"", 'There are many ways seniors can get the most bang for their buck during travel, and road trips can be one such option.

Moreover, the opportunity to experience scenic views along the way, explore the local cuisine and culture, as well as visit local attractions seems all too intriguing for the old folks.', '“..with the ability to bring family members along, many find road trips to be a budget-friendly choice as well as a fun one. Multi-generational road trips can improve emotional well-being, increase connections with loved ones, and benefit overall energy.”', '- Patty David, AARP Vice President of Consumer Insights', 'Road trip or otherwise, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

But are AARP hotel discounts worth it? Well, an AARP membership can get its members discounts at hotels, restaurants, and even car rental companies. Members can get a discount ranging from 5-20%, and some hotels even offer the feasibility of late checkouts on top of the discounts. Regarding discounts, many individuals often wonder which one is better for discounts, AAA or AARP. American Automobile Association, or AAA, is a member association and service organization that also offers similar hotel discounts like AARP. Some prominent hotels where AAA members can get a discount include Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), Best Western, Hyatt, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), and MGM Resorts. However, our research reveals that AARP is better for hotel discounts than AAA as they result in comparatively higher savings.', 'James R.

(NYSE:PHM) were released last week, making it a good time to revisit its performance. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$16b and statutory earnings per share of US$11.72 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that PulteGroup is executing in line with expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on PulteGroup after the latest results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for PulteGroup ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from PulteGroup's 13 analysts is for revenues of US$16.9b in 2024. This reflects a reasonable 5.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to reduce 2.5% to US$11.91 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$16.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$11.88 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""The consensus price target rose 5.6% to US$119despite there being no meaningful change to earnings estimates. It could be that the analystsare reflecting the predictability of PulteGroup's earnings by assigning a price premium. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on PulteGroup, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$138 and the most bearish at US$85.00 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the PulteGroup's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that PulteGroup's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 5.2% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 13% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this to the 92 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 4.7% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while PulteGroup's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's expected to grow roughly in line with the industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

This information should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.', 'Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides information on the percentage change in net sales growth as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant between the prior and current periods.', 'Other non-GAAP financial measures included in this release and the accompanying tables (including within the tables that provide the company’s detailed reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures) are: adjusted gross margin, adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, adjusted research and development expenses, adjusted other operating expense (income), net, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted other income (expense), net, adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted income tax expense (benefit), adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted income (loss) from discontinued operations, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Baxter stockholders, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, adjusted diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Those non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of special items. For the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, special items for one or more periods included intangible asset amortization, business optimization charges, acquisition and integration costs, separation-related costs, expenses related to European medical devices regulation, certain legal matters, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, non-marketable investment impairments, a pension curtailment gain, product-related items, a loss on a product divestiture arrangement, a loss on a subsidiary liquidation, the reclassification of a cumulative translation loss to earnings upon the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary, the gain on the sale of the BPS business and certain tax matters. These items are excluded because they are highly variable or unusual and of a size that may substantially impact the company’s reported operations for a period. Additionally, intangible asset amortization is excluded as a special item to facilitate an evaluation of current and past operating performance and is consistent with how management and the company’s Board of Directors assess performance.', 'This release and the accompanying tables also include free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure that Baxter defines as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is used by management and the company’s Board of Directors to evaluate the cash generated from Baxter’s operating activities each period after deducting its capital spending.', 'This release also includes forecasts of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis as part of the company’s financial outlook for upcoming periods. Baxter calculates forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, forward-looking adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes potential charges or gains that would be reflected as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings. Baxter provides forward-looking adjusted diluted EPS guidance because it believes that this measure provides useful information for the reasons noted above. Baxter has not provided reconciliations of forward-looking adjusted EPS guidance to forward-looking GAAP EPS guidance because the company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the impact of legal proceedings, future business optimization actions, separation-related costs, integration-related costs, asset impairments and unusual gains and losses, and the related amounts are unavailable without unreasonable efforts (as specified in the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K). In addition, Baxter believes that such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of financial performance.', 'Forward-Looking Statements', 'This release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company’s financial results (including the outlook for first-quarter and full-year 2024) and business development and regulatory activities. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the company’s ability to execute and complete strategic initiatives, asset dispositions and other transactions and development activities, including the proposed separation of the company’s Kidney Care business, the company’s plans to simplify its manufacturing footprint and the timing for such transactions, the ability to satisfy any applicable conditions and the expected proceeds, consideration and benefits; failure to accurately forecast or achieve the company’s short- and long-term financial performance and goals (including with respect to the company’s strategic initiatives and other actions) and related impacts on our liquidity; the company’s ability to execute on its capital allocation plans, including the company’s debt repayment plans, the timing and amount of any dividends, share repurchases and divestiture proceeds and the capital structure of the company to be formed as a result of the proposed spinoff of our Kidney Care business (and the resulting capital structure for the remaining company); the company’s ability to successfully integrate acquisitions; the impact of global economic conditions (including, among other things, inflation levels, interest rates, financial market volatility, banking crises, the potential for a recession, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East (including recent attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea), tensions between China and Taiwan, and the potential for escalation of these conflicts, the related economic sanctions being imposed globally in response to the conflicts and potential trade wars and global public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or the anticipation of any of the foregoing, on the company’s operations and on the company’s employees, customers, suppliers, and foreign governments in countries in which the company operates; downgrades to the company’s credit ratings or ratings outlooks, and the impact on the company’s funding costs and liquidity; product development risks, including satisfactory clinical performance and obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals (including as a result of evolving regulatory requirements or the withdrawal or resubmission of any pending applications), the ability to manufacture at appropriate scale and the general unpredictability associated with the product development cycle; product quality or patient safety issues leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, warning letters, import bans, sanctions, seizures, litigation or declining sales, including the focus on evaluating product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines; future actions of, or failures to act or delays in acting by, FDA, the European Medicines Agency or any other regulatory body or government authority (including the SEC, Department of Justice or the Attorney General of any State) that could delay, limit or suspend product development, manufacturing or sale or result in seizures, recalls, injunctions, monetary sanctions or criminal or civil liabilities; demand and market acceptance risks for, and competitive pressures related to, new and existing products, challenges with the company’s ability to accurately predict changing consumer preferences and future expenditures and inventory levels, and challenges with the company’s ability to monetize new and existing products and services, the impact of those products on quality and patient safety concerns and the need for ongoing training and support for our products; breaches, including by cyber-attack, data leakage, unauthorized access or theft, or failures of or vulnerabilities in, the company’s information technology systems or products; the continuity, availability and pricing of acceptable raw materials and component parts, the company’s ability to pass some or all of these costs to the company’s customers through recent price increases or otherwise, and the related continuity of the company’s manufacturing and distribution and those of the company’s suppliers; inability to create additional production capacity in a timely manner or the occurrence of other manufacturing, sterilization or supply difficulties, including as a result of natural disaster, war, terrorism, global public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, regulatory actions or otherwise; the company’s ability to finance and develop new products or enhancements on commercially acceptable terms or at all; loss of key employees, the occurrence of labor disruptions (including as a result of labor disagreements under bargaining agreements or national trade union agreements or disputes with works councils) or the inability to attract, develop, retain and engage employees; failures with respect to the company’s quality, compliance or ethics programs; future actions of third parties, including third-party payers and the company’s customers and distributors (including GPOs and IDNs); changes to legislation and regulation and other governmental pressures in United States and globally, including the cost of compliance and potential penalties for purported noncompliance thereof, including new or amended laws, rules and regulations as well as the impact of healthcare reform and its implementation, suspension, repeal, replacement, amendment, modification and other similar actions undertaken by the United States or foreign governments, including with respect to pricing, reimbursement, taxation and rebate policies; the outcome of pending or future litigation; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; global regulatory, trade and tax policies, including with respect to climate change and other sustainability matters; the ability to protect or enforce the company’s patents or other proprietary rights (including trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how) or where the patents of third parties prevent or restrict the company’s manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; the impact of any goodwill, intangible asset or other long-lived asset impairments on the company’s operating results; fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates; any changes in law concerning the taxation of income (whether with respect to current or future tax reform); actions by tax authorities in connection with ongoing tax audits; and other risks identified in Baxter’s most recent filings on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on Baxter’s website.

Polymeropoulos', ""Thank you very much, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Vanda's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. I will briefly discuss key updates and then I will ask our General Counsel, Tim Williams, to provide a brief update on litigation measures before turning the call over to Kevin Moran to discuss our financial results.We have significantly advanced our development pipeline now with 3 PDUFA action dates in 2024, including our supplemental new drug application or sNDA for bipolar I disorder in adults with a PDUFA date in April of 2024 and our New Drug Application, or NDA, for gastroparesis with a PDUFA date in September 2024. On our supplemental NDA for HETLIOZ in the treatment of insomnia, as we previously communicated this week, our sNDA was accepted for filing and is under review by the FDA with a PDUFA target action date of March 4, 2024. Earlier this week, we announced that we had received a notification from the FDA stating that the FDA had identified deficiencies that preclude discussion of labeling and post-marketing requirements and commitments at this time. No deficiencies were disclosed by the FDA in the notification, and the FDA stated that the notification does not reflect a final decision on the information under review. However, frequently, such a communication from the FDA is followed by a complete response letter. Subsequent to that development on February 6, 2024, Vanda filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colombia, challenging the FDA's conduct in reviewing the insomnia sNDA. Vanda is asking the District Court to compel the FDA to adhere to the legally mandated 180-day review period for sNDAs and to declare as unlawful and void the regulations the FDA relies upon to issue complete response letters. On Fanapt, for bipolar I disorder, as previously discussed in December of 2022, we announced positive results in our Phase III clinical study of Fanapt in acute manic and mixed episodes with bipolar I disorder in adults. Our supplemental NDA for Fanapt in bipolar I disorder in adults has been accepted for filing by the FDA, and the target action date has been set is April 2, 2024.We believe that this potential label expansion represents a significant opportunity for the Fanapt franchise given the high prevalence of bipolar disorder in the United States. The estimated prevalence of bipolar disorder in the U.S. adult population is multiple times larger than the estimated prevalence of schizophrenia. Additionally, on tradipitant for patients with gastroparesis, our new drug application has also been accepted for filing by the FDA, and the target action date has been set as September 18, 2024. The FDA package supported by the results from clinical efficacy studies 2301 and 3301, which we believe demonstrate substantial evidence of efficacy of tradipitant in this indication as well as a safety database to support the tolerability of this drug. The expanded access program continues with multiple patients have been treated for at least 6 months and the longest-treated patient for more than 3 years.We're pleased with our revenue performance despite the challenges of the Atrius launches of generic HETLIOZ products. Over the course of this year, we have taken a number of actions intended to position the commercial business for continued success, both with respect to existing products and indications as well as potential future products and indications. These include preparations for the potential near-term expansion of the Fanapt franchise if we received FDA approval for bipolar I disorder in adults.During the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed a transformative acquisition as we obtained the U.S. and Canadian rights to PONVORY, ponesimod from Actelion Pharmaceuticals Limited, a Johnson & Johnson Company for USD 100 million. PONVORY is a once-a-day oral selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 modulator, approved by the FDA and Health Canada to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Additionally, PONVORY is a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of a diverse group of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders ranging from psoriasis to ulcerative colitis. Most recently, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a notice of allowance for PONVORY patent application, 17/962,968, which when issued, is anticipated to expire on October 10, 2042.On the clinical side, as previously reported, in May of last year, we announced positive results from the first Phase III study of tradipitant in the treatment of motion sickness. And subsequent to that, we initiated a second Phase III study, which is now already 50% enrolled. We plan to pursue FDA approval of tradipitant for motion sickness upon completion of the clinical development program. And outside of this update on the tradipitant motion sickness program will continue to progress our robust clinical development pipeline, which includes multiple products across a wide range of therapeutic areas.With that, I will now ask Tim Williams, our General Counsel, to provide a brief update on litigation matters. Tim?"", 'Timothy Williams', ""Thank you, Mihaels. I'll provide a few litigation updates, starting with our HETLIOZ ANDA litigation. We filed a cert petition with the Supreme Court in January, asking the court to hear our case and clarify important aspects of patent obviousness law for the benefit of lower courts, including the Federal Circuit. The defendants, Teva and Apotex have waived their opportunity to respond to our petition. And today, the petition was distributed to chambers at the Supreme Court for consideration. We await their review.Next, I'll provide an update of our case pending in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In May of 2023, we sued the U.S. government for uncompensated taking of our trade secrets and confidential information. This suit alleges a pattern of FDA reviewers in properly disclosing proprietary information to generic companies as part of the review of generic versions of Fanapt and HETLIOZ. The U.S. government moved to dismiss the case. After a January hearing on the matter, the court denied the government's motion to dismiss, allowing us to proceed with fact discovery, which will include document production and depositions of FDA personnel involved in these matters.We've also had positive developments in our cases, challenging other agency actions of the FDA. In September of 2022, we sued to compel the FDA to adhere to the procedural and timing requirements of the Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act with respect to our Jet Lag sNDA for HETLIOZ. In January, the court ruled in our favor by finding that the FDA violated the Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act and ordering the FDA to take action on our hearing requests by March 5, more than 4 months earlier than FDA had originally proposed to the court. The court found the FDA's conduct to be both unlawful and unreasonable. Specifically, the judge noted that the law requires hearings to commence within 300 days after an sNDA is submitted by a sponsor. Yet our sNDA for Jet Lag has been pending for over 2,000 days and it has been over 500 days since we requested a hearing. As I mentioned, the judge has demanded the FDA act on our hearing request by March 5, and we await FDA's action by that date. Just yesterday, we filed an additional suit challenging FDA's unlawful conduct in reviewing our insomnia sNDA for HETLIOZ. As disclosed earlier this week, we received a notification from the FDA stating that it had identified deficiencies that preclude discussion of labeling even though no deficiencies were identified. This communication arrived more than 270 days after our submission which is well beyond the 180 days prescribed by the statute. Further, by sending us this letter rather than taking the specific actions prescribed in the Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act, we believe the FDA is seeking to avoid final action that can be reviewed by a court of law. In our suit filed last night, we are asking the court to compel the FDA to adhere to the legally mandated 180-day review period and to declare as unlawful and void the regulations the FDA relies upon to avoid judicially reviewable final decisions. We continue to pursue additional litigation related to our HETLIOZ patents, generic competitors, interactions with regulators and various Freedom of Information Act disputes. Details of all of our cases can be found in our disclosures and in publicly available court records. Back to you, Mihaels."", 'Mihael H. Polymeropoulos', 'Thank you very much, Tim. I will now turn the call to Kevin Moran, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our financial results. Kevin?', 'Kevin Patrick Moran', ""Thank you, Mihaels. And as Mihaels mentioned, I'll begin by highlighting the acquisition of the U.S. and Canadian rights to PONVORY from Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd or Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson Company for $100 million that was completed in December of 2023 and where the transition is ongoing. PONVORY is a once-daily oral selective S1P1R modulator approved by the FDA in Health Canada to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. .During this transition period, Janssen will continue to operate the business pursuant to a customary transition agreement, while Vanda and Janssen transition regulatory and supply responsibility for PONVORY to Vanda. This acquisition represents a significant milestone for Vanda expanding our commercial portfolio, diversifying our sources of revenue and providing Vanda the opportunity to develop a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of a diverse group of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders ranging from psoriasis to ulcerative colitis.Turning now to our financial results. I'll first discuss the results for the full year 2023 before turning to discuss the fourth quarter of 2023. Total revenues for the full year 2023 were $192.6 million, a 24% decrease compared to $254.4 million for the same period in 2022. HETLIOZ net product sales were $100.2 million for the full year 2023 and saw a 37% decrease compared to $159.7 million for the same period in 2022. The at-risk launch of generic versions of HETLIOZ had a significant impact on HETLIOZ's performance during 2023. The decrease to net product sales was attributable to a decrease in price net of deductions and a decrease in volume.Our HETLIOZ's net product sales for the first quarter of 2023 reflected higher unit sales as compared to recent prior periods and has resulted in a significant increase of inventory stocking at specialty pharmacy customers throughout 2023. Turning now to Fanapt. Fanapt net product sales of $90.9 million for the full year 2023 reflect a 4% decrease compared to $94.7 million for the same period in 2022. PONVORY net product sales were $1.6 million for the full year 2023. These net product sales reflect the revenue generated during the period between the product acquisition date of December 7, 2023, and the year-end on December 31, 2023. For the full year 2023, Vanda recorded net income of $2.5 million compared to net income of $6.3 million for the same period in 2022. Net income for the full year 2023 included an income tax provision of $3.8 million as compared to an income tax provision of $5 million for the same period in 2022. Operating expenses for the full year 2023 were $206.6 million compared to $248.1 million for the same period in 2022. The $41.5 million decrease was primarily driven by lower R&D expenses, lower SG&A expenses and lower cost of goods sold. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily driven by decreases related to our late-stage Fanapt development program, partially offset by increases related to our tradipitant and VHX-896 also referred to as PDA development programs.The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by lower expenses associated with marketing, sales and commercial support activities for our commercial products. The lower cost of goods sold is due to lower HETLIOZ's net product sales and the decrease in the royalty rate owed to BMS on HETLIOZ's net product sales from 10% to 5% effective in December 2022. Vanda's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities referred to as cash as of December 31, 2023, was $388.3 million representing a decrease of $101.6 million compared to cash as of September 30, 2023, and a decrease of $78.6 million compared to December 31, 2022. The change in cash during both the fourth quarter of 2023 and the full year of 2023 reflect the completed acquisition of PONVORY from Janssen for $100 million.Turning now to our quarterly results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $45.3 million, a 30% decrease compared to $64.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 17% as compared to $38.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. HETLIOZ's net product sales were $21.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 47% decrease compared to $40.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. HETLIOZ's net product sales in the fourth quarter increased by 20% as compared to $17.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.The at-risk launch of a generic version of HETLIOZ continued to have a significant impact on HETLIOZ's performance during the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease in net product sales relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 was attributable to a decrease in volume. Our HETLIOZ net product sales as reported for the first quarter of 2023 reflected higher unit sales as compared to recent prior periods. The higher unit sales during the first quarter of 2023 resulted in a significant increase of inventory stocking at specialty pharmacy customers throughout 2023.HETLIOZ net product sales during the fourth quarter of 2023 reflect lower unit sales as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, which was partially attributable to the continued reduction of the elevated inventory levels at specialty pharmacy customers from the end of the first quarter of 2023.Turning now to Fanapt. Fanapt product sales were $22.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 7% decrease compared to $24.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fanapt net product sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 6% as compared to $21.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Fanapt prescriptions in the fourth quarter of 2023 as reported by (inaudible), decreased by approximately 3% compared to the third quarter of 2023. PONVORY net product sales were $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Again, these net product sales reflect the revenue generated during the period between the product acquisition date of December 7, 2023, and year-end on December 31, 2023.For the fourth quarter of 2023, Vanda recorded net loss of $2.4 million compared to net income of $6.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and net income of $100,000 in the third quarter of 2023.The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 included an income tax provision of $0.7 million as compared to an income tax provision of $2.8 million for the same period in 2022. And an income tax benefit of $0.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $52.4 million compared to $57.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The $5.5 million decrease was primarily driven by lower SG&A expenses related to spending on sales activities for our commercial products and legal expenses and lower cost of goods sold due to lower HETLIOZ net product sales and the decrease in the royalty rate owed to BMS on HETLIOZ's net product sales from 10% to 5% effective in December 2022, partially offset by higher R&D expenses related to our tradipitant program, including the NDA filing fee and the milestone payment made upon acceptance of the NDA for filing and manufacturing expenses associated with our VHX-896 program. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by $7.6 million as compared to $44.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by onetime expenses, including $2.4 million of expense recorded for the tradipitant NDA filing fee, $2 million for the associated NDA milestone payment to Eli Lilly, and $3 million of VHX-896 manufacturing costs.Given uncertainty surrounding the U.S. market for HETLIOZ for the treatment of Non-24 as a result of the ongoing HETLIOZ's patent litigation and the at-risk launch of generic versions of HETLIOZ, Vanda is unable to provide 2024 financial guidance at this time. Vanda will continue to evaluate its ability to provide financial guidance in future periods. HETLIOZ's net product sales will likely decline in future periods potentially significantly related to the at-risk launch of generic versions of HETLIOZ in the U.S. Additionally, the company constrained HETLIOZ's net product sales for the full year 2023 to an amount not probable of significant revenue reversal. As a result, HETLIOZ's net product sales could experience variability in future periods as the remaining uncertainties associated with variable consideration are resolved.With that, I'll now turn the call back to Mihaels."", 'Mihael H. Polymeropoulos', 'Thank you very much, Kevin. At this point, we will be happy to answer any questions you may have.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And your question comes from Andrew Tsai with Jefferies.', 'Lin Tsai', ""Congratulations on the acquisition of PONVORY. So maybe a couple of questions on that asset. First, what do you guys think you can do that J&J might not have been able to do in terms of driving sales growth of PONVORY? And then secondly, why is this differentiated from the other multiple sclerosis drugs out there? What's the appeal here?"", 'Mihael H. Polymeropoulos', ""Thank you very much, Andrew. First of all, to give a background here for everyone. PONVORY ponesimod belongs in the class of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor analogs. And their mechanism of action is by sequestering or preventing the egress of lymphocytes from peripheral lymph nodes so that they can have wide applications in disorders where you have autoimmune attack on a system or organ of the body. In the case of multiple sclerosis, this is central nervous system. As you also know, this class of drugs has several members. It started some years ago with fingolimod from Gilenya, now generic and has expanded with additional members in the class. We believe that ponesimod due to its receptor specificity and quick reversibility of effect can play a critical role for the treatment of multiple sclerosis for many groups of patients, especially for those that require a specificity avoiding side effects and quick reversibility. It has been clear that this drug may be attractive, especially to women of childbearing age as they contemplate family planning. In that the drug will come out of the circulation within a short period of time in a matter of days. And the same is true about the recovery of the lymphocytes. So directly to (inaudible) question, the increased specificity and quick reversibility both in amount and lymphocyte counts make this drug differentiated and attractive. Your second part of your question was what can we do different from J&J. And the simple answer is we plan to market it. J&J for their own business reasons had decided to remove their market in support of the product, while they were in the process of identifying a partner to divest it to. And so we believe there is a significant opportunity, both with neurologists and multiple cirrhosis centers and consumers to be able to increase the awareness of the existence of this potentially quite a useful product.And beyond that, as we have learned, this type of mechanism of action can be useful in an array of autoimmune disorders. In front of us, of course, are the examples of the effect in ulcerative colitis. And the BMS compound has been successfully addressing that as well as Pfizer's compound interestingly, not approved for multiple sclerosis do not pursue it, but actually directly being approved now for ulcerative colitis. And we think our drug PONVORY is well positioned from the mechanism of action with very key similarities to the receptor binding effects that both the BMS compound and the Pfizer compound we have, both of them successful in ulcerative colitis to give us reasons to believe that could be successful in that indication. In addition, Actelion, a J&J company, had conducted a Phase II large study in psoriasis, which was successful. And we are evaluating now a path to continue the development in that indication as well. And as I said, the opportunities around the once day oral sphingosine-1-phosphate analog like PONVORY are just beginning to be realized and likely there will be [wide]. We are developing our plans now. We're in the midst of the transition period, and we'll be able to talk more about these plans in the future."", 'Lin Tsai', ""That's very helpful. And then shifting gears to the HETLIOZ for insomnia news. What would be the realistic scenario here? Do you start hiring the sales force? Or do you wait until approval? How does this all work out?"", 'Mihael H. Polymeropoulos', 'Andrew, let me clarify. Are you asking about the insomnia in HETLIOZ or the bipolar and Fanapt.', 'Lin Tsai', 'HETLIOZ for insomnia.', 'Mihael H. Polymeropoulos', ""Yes. For HETLIOZ in insomnia, of course, we think given the negative letter by the FDA of deficiencies, although not named, preclude label negotiations. We think the most historical likely outcome is that will be followed by a complete response letter. We cannot imagine what the deficiencies are for this melatonin agonist now marketed for 10 years in (inaudible) disorder indications and with the file that clearly and ambiguously supports the effect of the drug in sleep onset insomnia. We are not expanding the HETLIOZ sales force and we're not planning any immediate marketing plans there."", 'Lin Tsai', 'Got it. And then maybe just speaking of the Fanapt for bipolar then or as well as tradipitant for gastroparesis, my final question is, is your confidence in those applications the same despite the insomnia development? And second to that is, are you hiring ahead of the potential PDUFA decision.', 'Mihael H. Polymeropoulos', ""Yes. So just to talk about confidence. Of course, we're optimistic because we believe in science and the robustness of our packages that we have already communicated with you all. But of course, where the experience with the agencies that we are prepared for unpredictable results. And having said that, we're cautiously working towards being ready to expand the already existing Fanapt sales force. And I will let Kevin give you a little more color of how we think about cadence of operational expenses there. And the same thing holds true for tradipitant in gastroparesis. We have done work prelaunch to understand the market and develop a commercial plan. But of course, we're quite a few months away from an agency action in September of 2018. And yet again there, we are proceeding very cautiously with the expenditures ahead of that decision.But I will let Kevin give you more color."", 'Kevin Patrick Moran', ""Yes. And thanks, Andrew. On the Fanapt side, specifically, as Mihaels mentioned, we have a very well-established commercial infrastructure given Fanapt's history on the market and as well as HETLIOZ' history on the market in the supporting activities and infrastructure associated with those. That being said, we've certainly taken actions to be prepared to and expand quickly on positive news. So I'd expect from a cadence perspective that there will be some preparation costs that we've began to execute against the first quarter, but more so, it would be upon a positive development that we would see a kind of cadence change."", 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Vanda management for closing remarks.', 'Mihael H. Polymeropoulos', 'Thank you very much all for joining us on this call. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.""]"

If you want to skip our overview of the agriculture industry and what can be classified as an agriculture stock, then you can take a look at the 5 Biggest Agriculture Stocks in 2024. ', ""Despite having been replaced by industrialization, services, and now information technology, agriculture is nevertheless indispensable when it comes to maintaining and growing modern day societies. At the same time, since it's the one industry that has accompanied modern day civilization since its start, agriculture has also evolved with the ages. Now, companies that we can characterize as agriculture stocks no longer need to be involved either directly in the process of farming, in the process of storing food, or even in providing products such as pesticides and fertilizers to make a farmer's life easier."", 'Instead, agriculture stocks such as the industrial behemoth Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) are manufacturing firms that make complex equipment capable of carrying out the tasks of hundreds of workers at a lower cost. Machines such as the ones made by Deere have transformed the way human beings have been able to grow, matching the impact by pureplay agriculture stocks such as Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. (NASDAQ:PACB) and Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA).', ""In fact, technologies that agriculture stocks such as Pacific Biosciences rely on would be classified as nothing short of science fiction at the very least or even magic by farmers of previous centuries. PacBio sells systems that enable scientists and researchers to sequence the code of biological organisms. So, while farmers of 1900 would have to contend with seeing their crops die in the face of disease, today's farmers can rely on crops that have been genetically engineered to be resistant to the same attackers. Similarly, ranchers or cattle farmers can rely on livestock capable of meeting modern day production needs of both milk and meat."", 'All these factors combined mean that agriculture stocks are quite lucrative. While they might not be as glitzy as high end artificial intelligence firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), agriculture stocks provide investors with the comfort of knowing that the demand for their products will continue as long as humans rely on biological food for sustenance. This makes the stocks attractive during periods of economic downturn, like their counterparts in the consumer defensive stock sector.', 'At the same time, agriculture stocks are nevertheless vulnerable to the same market weaknesses as other stocks. Like broader commodity prices, agriculture stocks also rely on global supply chain stability to act as the backbone of their valuation. For instance, companies like Corteva that sell seeds might have a large portion of their customers located in an international country. If the shipping lines to that country are threatened, or if domestic conditions make spending money difficult for locals, then Corteva might see its investors become worried - causing the share price to drop.', ""Broadly speaking, we can break down agriculture stocks into several categories depending on the supply chain. At the backend of the chain, or upstream as analysts would like to call it, are seed, fertilizer, and medicine companies such as Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), Corteva, and the well known Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (OTC:BAYRY). Then, after the farmers have grown the crops, firms such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) pop in and buy their products to act as a middle party between the farmer and the market. Agriculture stocks such as Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) procure products such as potatoes and sell them in the form of finished products such as fries further down the supply chain. From here on, agriculture stocks see the end of the road as retailers like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) deliver the product in the consumer's hands."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest agriculture stocks as we head into 2024. Some of the biggest agriculture stocks are Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE)."", 'A close-up shot of a cannabis leaf on a cannabis cultivation farm.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the biggest agriculture stocks, we ranked the U.S. listed top 21 holdings of the iShares MSCI Agriculture Producers ETF by their latest market capitalization and picked out the biggest stocks.', 'For this list of the biggest agriculture stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This pipeline operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.3%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $2.79 billion, down 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.32% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Williams Companies, Inc.

Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Quigley', ""Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Dan Crowley, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim McCabe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Triumph. As we review the financial results for the quarter, please refer to the presentation posted on our website this morning. We'll discuss our adjusted results. Our adjustments and any reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are explained in the earnings press release and in the presentation. Certain statements on this call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Dan, I'll turn it over to you."", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""Thanks, Tom, and welcome to Triumph's third quarter call. I'll open my remarks by covering the strategic action we took with the product support sale and the significant benefits it will provide. And Jim and I will discuss our Q3 performance and the primary factors impacting our results and our expectations for record Q4 results to end the fiscal year on an upswing. I'll wrap up with the growth drivers, which instill confidence in our multiyear outlook. Overall, I'm excited about Triumph's future and our ability to deliver expanding levels of profitability and cash flow. This is our first opportunity to discuss the recently announced sale of our product support business, which remains on track to close this quarter. For Triumph, this is a game-changing transaction, one that will provide both financial and strategic benefits. During our September 2023 Investor Day, we communicated Triumph's priorities and path to accelerating value creation in line with our stakeholder priorities. Delevering our balance sheet has been a top priority. This transformative divestiture will significantly accelerate our delevering progress by reducing our net debt by over 40% and materially reducing our interest carry as early as this March following transaction closure. On Tuesday, we provided a conditional notice on the repayment of certain of our bonds. Jim will provide more color on this later. As summarized on Slide 3, the divestiture truly represents a win for both our shareholders and bondholders and it's entirely consistent with our strategic plan to focus on differentiated components and systems of our own design and to own our aftermarket tail. When combined with expanding free cash flow and earnings from our remaining operations, this transaction positions Triumph to enter a recursive cycle of financial improvement with higher free cash flow and lower debt to accelerate our growth and shareholder value creation. As shown on Slide 4, post closing, Triumph will compete in 4 primary business areas: actuation products and services with 12 sites focused on hydraulic and electric actuation and mechanical controls. Systems and engine controls with 3 sites servicing the fuel and thermal control markets, geared solutions with 2 sites providing power transmissions, integrated gearboxes and loose gears, and interiors with 5 sites producing thermal acoustic insulation systems, composite ducting and cabin components. These are competitive businesses, which benefit from our lean transformation and diversity of customers and platforms. Post closing, substantially all of Triumph sales will be IP-based and/or sole source. We are taking immediate steps to rightsize the remaining company with an optimized cost structure that builds on the operational improvements implemented during our transformation and ensures we are well positioned to achieve our long-term financial and operational targets. To be clear, we expect to continue our steady progress towards 20% EBITDA margins and free cash flow conversion of 10% of sales or better over the medium term on the strength of Triumph's IP-based product portfolio. As I reflect on the third quarter that ended in December, there were clearly challenges. However, I'm pleased with our ability to generate 7 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth and to achieve positive free cash flow. Turning to Slide 5. I'll summarize the highlights from the quarter.Triumph generated year-over-year organic sales growth of 13% and driven by increasing commercial OEM production rates. Even excluding our discontinued third-party MRO results, our aftermarket sales increased year-over-year with spares and repairs accounting for a robust 26% of our Q3 sales. MRO sales will continue to be a valuable financial driver for Triumph after the sale. We grew our total company backlog by 20% above market growth rates as Triumph expands its participation in a broad array of platforms, customers and end markets. Our year-to-date book-to-bill for Triumph was a very strong 1.34. And as part of the mentioned rightsizing efforts, we initiated $40 million in cost reduction actions across the company to mitigate any short-term margin dilution from the product support sales and to achieve the long-term earnings and cash metrics we presented at our Investor Day. While Q3 sales were strong, Earnings and free cash flow came in below expectations as a result of delayed shipments due to a finite set of supply chain shortages and continued margin weakness in our interiors business. I'll cover both topics head on and provide facts supporting our confidence in our full year forecast. First, on the delayed deliveries, although our overall supplier on-time delivery and full metric, improved from 90% to 92% sequentially over Q3, we still experienced shortages, which held up higher margin deliveries and contributed to our working capital balance. The specific late deliveries in Q3 were primarily machine components, electronics, castings and bearings. Triumph staff are on site at these suppliers expediting shortages and developing alternate sources for the future. I've been in touch with the CEOs of these firms to secure their commitments to make their fourth quarter deliveries, and we're seeing the results early in Q4. January deliveries were solid with monthly sales of approximately $100 million, which supports our Q4 forecast. We expect over $50 million of inventory to be relieved in Q4. In many cases, we've already completed all Q4 products and are waiting on customer approvals to ship and collect. Customer demand is firm, meaning there's no new orders that are needed to close the fiscal year. Interior sales increased by 26% in the quarter, to only 15% of Triumph's total sales. That said, Interiors profitability in the quarter and free cash flow continued to lag expectations in Q3 due to the previously mentioned headwinds of labor and material inflation and the peso exchange rate. However, these results are about to change. We expect Interiors to generate mid- to high teens EBITDA margins in our Q4 as a result of the following actions. Contract price adjustments where customers have specified sole source material call outs and developing alternative sources for those products where suppliers have raised their input prices. Increased labor productivity from the lead events we initiated earlier this year to offset the minimum wage increases affecting all companies doing business in Mexico. I encourage you to view the videos of the 2 plants posted in Triumph's website or linked in page to see some of the improvements in the 2,000-plus men and women behind them. And then lastly, overhead absorption benefits from additional work we have been asked to take on from our competitors who are not supporting the OEM ramps, a sign of our customers' loyalty and Triumph's ready capacity. As we have done with our actuation and Engine Controls businesses, both of which are on path to generate EBITDA margins above 27%. Interiors can and will be restored to prior levels of profitability and free cash flow. Similarly, our Geared Solutions business is on track to deliver double-digit margins in fiscal '24 after years of work to retire red development programs and transition them to production. Turning to Page 6 and looking ahead to our fiscal '24 year-end, the combined tailwinds of deferred Q3 sales, inherent seasonality, incremental price increases and selected IP sales puts us on track to have a record Q4 that will translate into year-over-year margin expansion. Our updated guidance adjusts for the sale of product support. We have a clear line of sight across our (inaudible) to deliver over 20% EBITDA margins in Q4 compared to 16.7% for fiscal '23. As with the commercial OEMs who posted robust aircraft deliveries in their Q4, we are very busy with product shipments and cash collections in our Q4. As noted, January deliveries were strong as we conduct daily delivery assurance calls to close out our fiscal '24 with year-over-year improvement expected to cross all financial measures, including over $100 million of free cash flow improvement from prior year. We look forward to providing fiscal '25 guidance after the product support transaction closes with our year-end results during our next earnings call that reflect the combined contribution of our portfolio actions, cost takeout and lower interest payments. Jim will now take us through our third quarter results and updated outlook for fiscal '24 in more detail. Then I'll return to discuss our end market outlook and growth drivers. Jim?"", 'James F. McCabe', ""Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The sale of our product support business, which is on track to close this quarter will transform Triumph's balance sheet. The net proceeds of approximately $700 million will reduce Triumph's outstanding debt by over 40% and will reduce annual cash interest expense by approximately $56 million. Net leverage will reduce to approximately 4x adjusted EBITDA by our fiscal year-end next month. This lower leverage will improve our credit profile and create the opportunity for a lower cost of debt and even more interest savings moving forward. The Product Support business is now reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented current and historical. It is important to note that we are in a transitional period for financial reporting. Triumph's continuing operations in Q3 have not yet benefited from the expected $56 million of annual interest savings from the debt reduction from the transaction proceeds or from the planned $40 million of fixed cost reduction as we manage the continuing business to achieve our consolidated margin and cash flow targets. On Slide 7 is our net debt and liquidity. As of December 31, we had just under $1.5 billion of net debt. Our cash and availability was approximately $218 million. During the quarter, we purchased $31 million of our 2025 unsecured notes in the market. We purchased those notes at a discount to par, resulting in a $1 million gain. We intend to use the net proceeds for the sale of the product support business to delever and strengthen our balance sheet. To that end, yesterday, we provided our first lien bondholders with a conditional notice of redemption to redeem $120 million of the first lien 2028 [notes at 103]. We also provided our unsecured 2025 bondholders with a conditional notice of redemption to redeem all of our unsecured notes at par. Both redemptions are conditioned on the closing of the sale and the unsecured redemption will only occur after we conduct an asset sale offer to the first lien note holders. The first lien notes are currently trading above par, which should impact the holders' decision whether to tender their notes at par. Pro forma for the expected $700 million of divestiture proceeds, Triumph's net debt is less than $800 million. Triumph's third quarter results reflect significant revenue growth and cash generation improvement over the prior year period, partially offset by softness in results in interiors and in our geared solutions business and systems and support. On Slide 8 are the consolidated results for the quarter. Revenue was $285 million. For the continuing business, excluding divestitures and exited programs, organic revenue increased 13% over the prior year quarter. Organic revenue growth primarily benefited from increased commercial OEM volumes and commercial aftermarket repairs and spares while demand across most of our military end markets, slightly declined during the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $20 million, representing a 7% operating margin. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $28 million, representing a 10% EBITDA margin. We expect fourth quarter revenue margins to be significantly higher as you will see in our guidance. Slide 9 shows our growing commercial market revenue. For the quarter, commercial revenue was $180 million, representing 63% of total revenue. Commercial OEM sales were $141 million and were up 26% in the continuing business. This growth was driven by increases in both volume and price in key programs including the Boeing 787 and 737 programs. Commercial aftermarket sales of $39 million grew 26% in the continuing business on strong demand for commercial aftermarket spares and repairs. Slide 10 shows our military revenue, which is down slightly. For the quarter, military revenue was $97 million, representing 34% of total revenue. Military OEM sales were down 3% versus prior year as expected, lower sales on V-22, E-2D and AH-64 were partially offset by growth on the CH-53K program. Military aftermarket sales in the quarter were down 6% compared to last year on unfavorable timing for demand of spares and repairs. The remaining 1% of our revenue is non-aviation, which is profitable, represented about $3 million of sales in the quarter and is down slightly over last year. Our free cash flow [walk] is on Slide 11. We generated $22 million of free cash flow in Q3, even with working capital using $23 million of cash in support of increasing fourth quarter sales volume and increasing free cash flow generation. Our fiscal '24 guidance begins on Slide 12. Our guidance is being updated to exclude product support since it is now reported as discontinued operations. Based on anticipated aircraft production rates, we expect organic growth of 12% to 14% in fiscal '24, with revenue in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.2 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is in the range of $157 million to $167 million, indicating up to a 14% consolidated EBITDA margin in fiscal '24 in the continuing business. Pro forma for the debt reduction interest savings, we continue to expect our continuing operations to be solidly cash positive in Q4, consistent with prior year seasonality driven by working capital liquidation on the fourth quarter sales surge, reduction in past-due backlog and increased inventory turns. We will continue to include product support in our year-end cash guidance given the uncertainty around the closing timing and update investors no later than our next earnings call in May. Interest expense is expected to be $151 million, including $145 million of cash interest, and we expect $7 million of cash taxes. This is prior to the anticipated $56 million of annual interest savings from debt reduction following the closing of the sale of the product support business. Organic margin expansion, cash generation and debt reduction are expected to drive our net leverage from 7.6x last fiscal year-end to approximately 4x at the end of fiscal '24 next month. We are updating our operating plans as we do this time each year and expect to provide FY '25 guidance on our next earnings call. With the product support business now classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented, you have current and historical results for the continuing business, including sales by end market, all excluding product support. Please also consider the $56 million of annual interest savings from debt reduction with the divestiture proceeds and the $40 million of fixed cost reduction actions being taken. In summary, third quarter results included solid organic revenue growth and positive cash generation, yet lower than planned EBITDA and operating margin due to the impact of industry-wide supply chain constraints and inflation, both of which we are actively addressing. Triumph's fundamentals remain strong as we continue to focus on our OEM components, IP-based spares and MRO business. Now I'll turn the call back to Dan. Dan?"", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""Thanks, Jim. Turning to Page 13. I want to share more detail on the growth outlook and the product investments that underpin our excitement in Triumph's future. Both global passenger travel demand, which we measure in RPKs and airline revenues were at or above 2019 levels in 2023. This demand is expected to rise another 10% in 2024, lifting roughly 2/3 of Triumph sales. The strong recovery in airline financials is reflected in higher commercial transport aircraft orders Airbus finished 2023 with record net orders of 2,094 aircraft and Airbus production rate projections are largely holding as reflected in their supplier portal. Triumph's main Airbus narrow-body content on the A320 321neo family now at rate 60 per month, includes the LEAP engine gearbox engine, cal, door actuation, valves, landing gear up locks and a hydraulic transfer pump. On the A350, now at rate 6 per month, our content includes cabin installation, pumps, utility actuation and control valves, so profitable content on ramping Airbus programs. Boeing secured 1,314 net orders including the second highest year of 787 orders at 301 since program launch, which gives us confidence that rates of 10 a month or higher are increasingly likely. Note that the Dreamliner is Triumph's highest shipset value program at $1 million per aircraft. Together, in 2023, Airbus and Boeing posted 709 twin aisle orders. This is good news for Triumph as we have substantial twin aisle content. Year-over-year, Triumph's fiscal '24 revenue on the top 4 commercial aircraft programs is up 40% in aggregate while backlog rose another 32% even as shipments rise substantially. Regarding the recent headlines on the 737 MAX production rate, we are aligned with Boeing who are maintaining component build rates of approximately 38 per month in their supplier portal. We do not expect any impact to our multiyear projections due to the recent FAA announcements. We are fully supporting Boeing's supply chain-wide quality improvement efforts as well. In summary, Triumph's commercial OEM sales are up 18% year-over-year. Despite the supply chain challenges impacting the industry and expected to continue to increase with the production ramp of both wide-body and narrow-body aircraft. On the military side, we're seeing a rotation of platform investments as OEM demand for legacy aircraft, such as the V-22 and UH60 decline, while development programs such as the T-7A and CH-53K transition to production and next-gen platforms such as the Army's Future Vertical Lift and next-gen air dominance get started. On Slide 14, key wins for the quarter included additional GE military engine fueldraulic actuators, betas CX300 eVTOL nose and main landing gear shocks struts and a DARPA Sprint program, gearbox design, all solutions based on Triumph IP. Now 38% of our sales, we expect our mix of military business to continue to turn over with new starts replacing legacy programs and this is where Triumph's work on product innovation will generate long-term value and new aftermarket streams. Turning to Slide 15. Triumph has embarked on a modular solutions approach whereby core products and engine controls, thermal cooling, actuation and gearboxes, find application on both commercial and military platforms, often developed with customer funding, these core products will be the engine of growth over our planning horizon and a strong source of competitive advantage. A case in point, Triumph has been selected for GE's next-gen engines for critical actuators and Honeywell's APUs on the strength of our modular digital controls that are scalable, redundant, cyber proof and affordable. Once qualified non-wing, we expect these core products to generate significant top and bottom line growth in the years to come. On Slide 16, I also want to highlight the recent opening of Triumph's new state-of-the-art Thermal Solutions Development Center at West Hartford in partnership with the State of Connecticut. As aircraft electrical and thermal loads increase, aircraft designers need ways to get that heat offboard. And this lab will provide new capabilities to our growing thermal customer base helping to develop next-gen thermal components and integrated system solutions. We are particularly excited about our solution for the F-35 power and thermal management system known as PTMS, where Triumph is 1 of 3 firms down selected by the F-35 joint program office to compete for the Phase 1 development effort. We're competing against incumbent Honeywell and Raytheon Technologies to be the integration lead in offering an 80-kilowatt advanced vapor cycle cooling capability for the Lightning II that will be validated in our new West Hartford Thermal Development Center. We are engaged on other thermal solution programs with Northrop Grumman, Sikorsky, Bell and General Atomics. So in summary, if you combine steadily improving commercial OEM demand, with Triumph's strong position on next-gen military platforms, our high-margin aftermarket sales and improving balance sheet and cost takeout actions we initiated in Q3 and you've got a recipe for strong follow-through in Q4 in the years ahead. Despite supply chain delays in our third quarter, my team and I are excited about the future for our company and are set up for a very strong Q4. Triumph's actions to accelerate our deleveraging demonstrates our commitment to value creation and will create the right conditions for success in fiscal '25 and beyond as the combined benefits of our growing backlog and lower interest expense, fuels our IP-based OEM and aftermarket business. We look forward to updating our investors in May and are happy to take any questions you have."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.', 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""So first question I had on the aftermarket. So it was kind of interesting in the release it talks about aftermarket sales, including both repair and overhaul and spare parts. And I assume that's excluding the product support business. So in terms of the aftermarket, how would you describe the split between repair and overhaul versus spare parts within the aftermarket and remaining Triumph. And is it significantly different between commercial and military?"", 'James F. McCabe', ""Seth, it's Jim. You're correct that the -- all the presentation excludes product support for the end market analysis. So it's roughly 50-50 of MRO versus spares in that business. In the quarter, aftermarket business was about 27% around $73 million. But obviously, it's higher margin than the OEM business. And it's all based on our IP, too. So that's one thing we make people understand is that we are still in the aftermarket, but we're in the aftermarket with our intellectual property, spares and repairs."", 'Seth Michael Seifman', 'So think about the repairs piece of it as being IP-based as well.', 'James F. McCabe', 'Correct.', 'Seth Michael Seifman', 'Okay. Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up question in that same vein. The level of profitability, margin rate between commercial aftermarket and military aftermarket, is there a very significant difference there?', 'James F. McCabe', ""Over time, no, on specific programs, yes, but I think that they are comparable levels of profitability because they are based on our IP. We do see a premium for foreign military sales. That's where we tend to command a bigger premium because these foreign countries haven't invested in the development costs that the U.S. government has on the platform. So they pay a premium for those products. And that tends to be more lumpy or cyclical. We've had quarters where that's really contributed. This wasn't -- obviously, Q3 wasn't one of them, but when we get the FMS spares, it's benefits us greatly."", 'Seth Michael Seifman', 'Okay. Excellent.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""I wanted to maybe ask about systems and support, just given the support send off there and great job on that. But what do we think about systems margins underlying longer term? I think you made a comment that you're keeping your long-term free cash flow target, but the interest -- lower interest is offset by margin dilution. So if you can maybe rightsize us on what systems profitability looks like going forward?"", 'James F. McCabe', ""Yes. So Sheila, thanks for the question. Historically, you can see that when you pull out the product support business [discops,] that our margin for this year is around 14% instead of the 16% we were forecasting before. So the product support business was slightly higher than our average margin. That's what we're referring to in terms of the consolidated margins being down a little bit in the current year when you pull out product support. But the rest of the business still has the same growth characteristics, still has the same margin targets and is still very strong and growing. So system support is just now more IP-based, and we'll have higher margin in the aftermarket."", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""Yes. As you can imagine, Sheila, when you take a business that's generating 20% plus EBITDA margins out of the portfolio, you'll see a short-term dip, but that's the mandate to me and my management team is to get interiors and geared solutions to levels of profitability they've been at before. In fact, one of my directors and the Board mentioned, he said, gears used to be our most profitable business, but we went through a period of winning and working through these development programs that have reduced their margins, and those are now coming back, and we're going to get interiors turned around as well. That used to be a 20% business. So when all 4 of our businesses actuation, engine controls, interiors and gears are hitting on all cylinders, you're going to see follow through on margins."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', 'Okay. Great. And then maybe to follow up on your free cash flow guidance for the year, you bracketed it depending on the timing of the divestiture closing. So is it kind of fair to assume that support was 100% free cash flow conversion or about $55 million of free cash flow annually?', 'James F. McCabe', ""That tends a little high because we have CapEx and other working capital movements within the period. So it is important to note that for cash flow purposes, you don't exclude this discontinued operations. And we did footnote on the guidance slide there. That includes product support, but sales and profitability do not. So because we don't know the exact timing of the transaction closing, we just included the cash flow for the whole business, including product support in that forecast. But it might be less or more depending on the timing."", 'Daniel J. Crowley', 'It turns out that product support carries more inventory because they have a big rotable balance and the cash conversion and our other OEM component business is, in fact, higher.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""So is the right way to think about it, that $10 million delta you have in your guidance for free cash flow, just annualize that sorry, it's closer to $40 million then?"", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""That's a reasonable approach."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird.', 'Peter J. Arment', 'Dan, you called out interiors and kind of your confidence of the margins kind of turning higher in the fourth quarter, and it sounds like that seems sustainable. Just maybe you could just give a little more color around the contract price adjustments. You said just confidence around increased labor productivity. And I think obviously, overhead absorption as rates increase. But you also mentioned some red development programs. Maybe if you could just peel back some of the moving parts here.', 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""Yes. In interiors, there are no development programs. They're all mature production programs, not just Boeing, we do a lot on 737, 787, but also for Airbus and A220. And those programs are all ramping in rate. So it's a matter of getting the volumes up in the plant, which has absorption benefits. The main issues I talked about on interiors or external forces, Mexico has raised the minimum wage again. We're dealing with the last -- hopefully, the last blast of the peso exchange rate and then we've had some suppliers raise input costs. But the mandate to us remains the same, which is how do you get margins up. So we're doubling down on the productivity initiatives. I do encourage you to check out those videos of the 2 largest plants in Mexico because you get a sense of just how much automation we already have in those plans. And some of the material input materials like the resins that we use to make up these installation blankets have gone up significantly in price. So we're working on that. Within interiors, there's 3 components. There's insulation, there's composite ducting and there's cabin components. It's mostly been the composite ducting that's really held us up. So we've -- we're in discussions with our customers on pricing for that. What's been encouraging is that our customers have come to us and said, hey, other suppliers of these commodities are not performing and they're not ready to ramp. They don't have the staffing, and we want you to take on that work as early as Q4. So that's where we're going to see the combined contributions of these productivity initiatives and volume offset the external drivers."", 'Peter J. Arment', ""I appreciate that color. Just as a follow-up question. Just you called out that you're still confident in kind of approaching your total company EBITDA margin of 20%. And I assume over the medium term, that still is kind of targeting the fiscal '26, which you laid out in your Investor Day. Is that still fair?"", 'James F. McCabe', ""So we're doing our planning right now. So we're not reiterating the exact timing, but that's still the target. So the timing can move slightly but it's very much achievable. And we were on a pace of growing 150 to 200 basis points a year. And so we hope that, that pace is going to continue as we finish our planning process. The volumes are a little different in each of the segments. And with the overhead reduction and efficiencies were able to enable that event reduction. We're looking forward to 20% very soon."", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""Yes. One of the factors, Peter, that gives us confidence is that we're running hotter on year-over-year sales growth than the market. And that's -- we've been asked by analysts, hey, your book-to-bill sounds great, but when are we going to see it translate into sales? And the answer is, it is now. We're seeing it across the commercial and MRO accounts. So now it's a matter of getting margins up, which we're focused on doing in Q4. And in Q3, we had some delay in shipments that were held up that were higher-margin deliveries. It was a disappointment. When you don't have the bearings or the castings that are critical to certain high-value components and you can ship them it's really impactful. So we've got to get those in. Many of those have already been delivered in Q4, and we're confident we can do it. But on the path to 20%, I would say, performing at a higher revenue growth rate in the market is going to provide lots of lift for all the businesses."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""I was hoping, Dan, maybe you could dig into the $40 million in corporate costs or overhead direct fixed cost removal that you're doing? And is it -- how much of that is directly related to the 20% reduction in underlying size of the company because of product and support how much of it was already planned. If you can just dig a little bit deeper."", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""Certainly. So we spend about almost $500 million, not quite $500 million in SG&A and overhead. It's a big number, and it pays for things like updating our IT systems, improved controls, research and development, engineering product development and that's really how you drive long-term growth. And when I was at Raytheon, that was really the strength of our portfolio as the investments we made in platforms like Patriot and we've done enough now on that, that as we take out 1 of the 5 operating companies, there's the automatic gets smaller by that percent that you cited. But we've been doing enough investment in the infrastructure of the company in common processes, common IT and we can now start to scale back some of those investments and run the company in a leaner more agile function or fashion. So we're confident we can do it. It's not just labor. There's also nonlabor costs that we'll take out -- and this is going to help us maintain our margin progression. These reductions have been in work. They build on reductions we've made in the past. You've been following our story a long time. So you remember when we had EVPs over 6 segments, plus 47 presidents. We entirely eliminated the EVP and segment level and consolidated those 47 presidents down to 5. Now with the sale of TPS down to 4. We're looking at further reductions there. So those are enablers. The last enablers as we've matured the team. We have a really strong leadership team that's not just focused on backlog execution, but they have a much stronger profit orientation looking at contracts, pricing, value claiming. And we're now more comfortable having centralized a lot of our processes going back to a little bit more of a decentralized model and that allows us to take out costs at headquarters. So those -- that's the overall context for the $40 million."", 'Myles Alexander Walton', 'Okay. Good. And then just 2 clarifications, if I could. One is the implied margins removed from the guidance for about 23%. But I think the first half product support margins were about 16% on an EBITDA basis. And then the other clarification, just on that dashboard you have at the end, where you have an increased percentage of aftermarket and increased percentage of military, by definition, it implies a decrease in commercial OE, which is a little counterintuitive.', 'James F. McCabe', ""Yes. Thanks, Myles. I think we're going to have to follow up with some of that with the public data on with when the Q gets filed this afternoon. You're going to see in the Q the disclosure of discontinued operations working down. So I think you'll get some of your answers in there. But remember, there is seasonality in product support. So the fourth quarter is one of the stronger quarters, and that may be what you're seeing in the numbers."", 'Myles Alexander Walton', 'And then sorry, the dashboard with the percentage growth in military and aftermarket implying that percentage declines in OE is a little counterintuitive.', 'James F. McCabe', ""So I think it's Slide 13, you're referring to with the positive growth outlook slide."", 'Myles Alexander Walton', 'Yes, correct. The bottom left two charts show percentage increase to revenue and military (inaudible).', 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""If we had gone back a few years on military revenue, you'd see that it started at 20% when I started the restructuring transformation. And then we built it up into the high 30s. During the pandemic when the aircraft fleet was stood down and military shot up. And then now commercials resurging. So this number moves around. But what this reflects is the growth of those platforms that I mentioned that are transitioning to production and coming into development and we're spending the money now in the product development to support those next gen. So we do see a tick up. But I think the sort of 60-40 split of commercial OEM will be the average. It will move around from year to year. And then on aftermarket, we're going to continue to drive that. And that's -- I want that to be really clear message is that even as TPS exits the portfolio, we have significant opportunities on the aftermarket and almost every one of our OEM plants has an embedded depot where they do the repairs and overhaul. So you'll see that continue to grow as a percent of our sales."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', ""Maybe just back to the longer targets and tied in to Sheila's question, I think you had free cash flow conversion kind of at 6% of sales in the 26 time period moving to 10%. How should we think about those? I mean it seems like the near-term interest savings could potentially drive some upside. So just any more color on the cash targets."", 'James F. McCabe', ""The targets are still the same. I think there are our steady-state target was 10% plus on cash flow conversion and 20% plus on margins. And we did have that [way point] that we put out there in September. But we're revisiting that and maybe we can bring that in, it could move a little bit at a point, but it's still going to just be modest timing differences and those remain the same, and the continuing business has the potential to deliver those. I think our cost outs are only going to enhance our ability to deliver those and maybe a little bit earlier."", 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', ""Okay. Got it. Got it. And then just you called out in the press release the revenue headwind. Just to reconcile, I mean, the difference between what that moved into support. What was the magnitude of the revenue headwind that you saw this quarter? And I mean it sounds like you're going to obviously pick all that up and get some pretty good inventory tailwinds next quarter. But can you kind of detail the revenue pressure?"", 'James F. McCabe', ""Yes. So I mean the exact magnitude, I don't think I have in total. What we have is the themes behind it because what we're seeing is the late shipments that are mostly going to be delivered in January or in Q4. And they're related to, for example, the one I was just looking at last night was military was down slightly. Well, that was driven by some electronic supplier shortages that are going to ship out in Q4. and we can ship more if we get more of the electronics. So we have people working closely with that supplier. That's one example. And there's other parts Dan referred to that are waiting for final (inaudible) approval, they're done. We just have to go through that process. So we put a chart in there quarter-over-quarter, so that you could see year-over-year that what is -- what the shortfall is in third quarter is being made up in whole part in fourth quarter. But the fourth quarter is not unrealistic based on historic seasonality. It is a big quarter. It will be a record quarter. And we've done a lot of work on it. Weekly, we talk about what has to get done to make sure we hit our numbers for the month. In the first month of the quarter, we already hit $100 million of sales, which is consistent with our plans for the quarter."", 'Daniel J. Crowley', 'I would say that the shortage is probably pace maybe $20 million of revenue in the quarter, if that helps Michael?', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', 'Okay. Got it. Perfect.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of TD Cowen.', 'Cai von Rumohr', ""Yes. So it looks here like if we use the midpoint of your guidance, you're looking for around $350 million in sales, you're looking for, it looks like margins of 23% adjusted EBITDA margins in the systems business. And you mentioned $100 million in January. So a very big step up in February and March. Are you assuming any kind of supplier slips because basically, this has been an environment where slips or more the norm rather than catch up? Are you assuming any -- is there sort of any assumption of some slip so that you would hit the number even if that occurred?"", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""Yes. Thanks, Cai. We do allow for less than 100% on time in full. That's always the goal, but you don't get it. And so what we've done is we've prioritized every shipment for Q4. We know every part that has to go out the door, the cash payment terms of that part and whether or not we need a customer consent to ship and these daily assurance -- delivery assurance calls that I chair, we go through each OpCo one a day, 5 days a week, and we know what we have to do to finish the year. It does not assume 100% parts availability, but we know the mix of parts that have to ship what they bring in terms of sales, cash and earnings and tying out to the Q4 financials. So the answer is, we got a plan, but it does not assume perfection in the supply chain. It's interesting because we're down to this, what I call, 4 finite commodity groups, really almost 4 individual suppliers, I won't name them on the call that are pacing us. But if you don't have circuit boards, and you don't have bearings, for example, and they go in lots of different products that you can't ship a lot of product. And so we've gotten commitments and priority. These are vendors that supply the whole aerospace food chain. And so sometimes you have to be the squeaky wheel to get your prorated share. And we're getting those commitments. And in January, we started to get the products so that's what's giving us confidence that we can still hit these big step-ups in Q4, even without 100% on time in full."", 'Cai von Rumohr', 'Terrific. And the second one, where are we with the Daher sued?', 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""So the Daher sued is it's been going on for some time. We entered into a settlement agreement with the buyer in June of last year that resolved a working capital dispute. And so we do have an ability to resolve issues with Daher. And that also resolved some claims related to accounts payable at the time. We were surprised, but in December, they filed litigation against the company, seeking additional indemnification related to 767 on the fuel tank issues. And this is an issue that was not known to Triumph or I should say, is not viewed as an issue at the point of sale to Boeing, our customer. So it's a large amount, but we work through similar types of claims in the past. We intend to vigorously defend the claims against our company for that. The fact is they bought an operation in July of 2022. And have responsibility for it. We take seriously our commitment to delivering quality products for our customers. And the site was sold as part of our portfolio transformation, and this has really been the only time where we've had these kind of reach back issues. So we have caps in place that limit our liability. There's 2 caps. There's a general cap at about $19 million, about $9 million of which has already been decremented because of the June settlement I mentioned and then another cap related to our reps and warranties. So there's really nothing new out there from a Triumph perspective. It's a difficult issue. Boeing has already resolved it. They've contained the issue on their side, they're continuing to deliver products. I'll point you to the 10-Q where we lay all this out."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays.', 'David Egon Strauss', ""Did you actually -- if you adjust for the divestiture, did you actually cut your EBITDA absolute EBITDA forecast for the year. I wasn't quite sure. Or is it kind of unchanged adjusting for the divestiture?"", 'James F. McCabe', ""So you broke up a second. I think you're asking, did we adjust our EBITDA for the?"", 'David Egon Strauss', 'Exactly, yes. Sorry. The absolute number, if you adjust for the divestiture.', 'James F. McCabe', 'Yes. We just removed product support.', 'David Egon Strauss', ""Okay. So it's unchanged at for that."", 'James F. McCabe', 'Yes, it should be materially unchanged.', 'David Egon Strauss', 'Okay. And a couple of people I think have asked around this on free cash flow as it relates to divestiture and interest savings. Jim, is it fair -- I mean it seems like this is accretive. The divestiture is accretive to go-forward free cash flow. Is that correct?', 'James F. McCabe', ""That's correct. So the interest savings is definitely accretive to cash flow moving forward. The $40 million part of that is related to the allocated or part of it is just normal course moving forward to harvest efficiencies. But those are all cash positive. And when you compare it to the cash generation of the divested business, it's accretive to the continuing business."", 'David Egon Strauss', ""Okay. And then why wouldn't the free cash flow margin targets then be higher going forward given that you're stripping out revenue and your free cash flow is higher?"", 'James F. McCabe', ""Well, 10-plus has higher provided for in there. As we go through the planning process, I'm going to be saying the same thing to our team, and it's logical that, that flows through. And not only the interest savings now, but I alluded to it in my comments, was with the improved credit profile when we go to refinance our remaining debt, we should get better rates and better terms for that with improved credit. So that's going to be accretive to cash flow over the multiyear period as well."", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""That's really that recursive cycle that I mentioned where debt comes down, credit ratings go up, cost of borrowing goes down and then we expand free cash flow from operations which accelerates the rate of debt reduction on debt that can be refinanced at lower rates. It becomes a nice virtuous circle of cost reduction, which we haven't been able to crest that hill until now with this transaction. Most of the divestitures we've done, although we got, on average, 13x earnings over the 17 or so divestitures, they weren't really deleveraging. They just helped to stop stem the tide of bleeding in the structures business with this transaction is meaningfully different."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America.', 'Ronald Jay Epstein', ""A lot has been covered so far. So maybe just a bigger picture question. I mean what's -- where do you expect to see Triumph in 5 years? What's the long-term plan for the company. With the sale of the division, it almost feels like you're at a turning point. where you could just keep getting smaller? Or do you pivot here and try to build the business in a different direction?"", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""Ron, it's the latter. I don't want to get smaller. This $40 million cost takeout is necessarily achievable, but there's a point at which the cost to run a public company and do the things we want to do become more difficult below a certain level of sales. The good news is, this TPS comes out of the portfolio and we level off around $1.2 billion in revenue. We can accelerate our top line organically, as I said, higher than the market growth rates to replace that and then we could begin to look at other options for the company. But our first priority remains deleveraging. We're happy about going from 7.5 down to 4%. That's good news. In terms of where we're going as a company, we think that Triumph the value gap between Triumph and companies like Woodward and Moog is unjustified. But we've got to prove it. We've got to go show that we can generate the earnings and cash and really go through that recursive virtuous cycle so that investors see the payoff for the time they've spent investing in our company, the money they've invested. So that's why we're excited about the future is when I go through those modular solutions on our new business front, those are the things that generate long-term value, and they have we're getting paid for the nonrecurring. We're getting paid for contract research and development. We're going to enjoy good OEM margins because they're discriminated solutions and then they'll have good aftermarket. This is a long game. I've been in this business a long time. I know how value is created. And it's becoming fun now. You can -- and you've been with us through the whole story, Ron. So it wasn't any fun dismantling the structures business, but we've done it, and it's been repositioned with the right owners. And now we've got a business with product support that's positioned with a very strong partner in AAR, who also has a distribution arm and heavy maintenance that can feed these plants. So that's the right transaction. But what it leaves Triumph with is this real crown jewels of actuation and engine controls and gearboxes. And yes, interiors, interiors will be better in the future. So in 5 years' time, what I think you'll see your point about pivoting now is to building on that core portfolio, expanding our products, expanding their reach on platforms and then driving the cash and earnings that this business is capable of doing."", 'Ronald Jay Epstein', ""Got it. Got it. And then maybe just a more short-term question. How are you guys really thinking about the impact of the MAX in your business? It's about, what, 18% of the backlog. So it's material. And there's so much volatility uncertainty around that program, particularly in the short term. I mean how do you think about managing that?"", 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""So I'm close to this. I remember walking the 777 line at Boeing in 1994, and I've walked their line ever since, including the 737 line. And I'm on monthly calls with Stan Deal and his team focused on things we can do as a combined industry team because it takes everybody Boeing can't do it alone if suppliers are generating escapes to them that they have to deal with. In terms of percent of our sales, it has gone up to about 14%. Nominally, we shoot for no one program. to be greater than 10%, but the MAX is just a huge important program with a big backlog. I do have confidence that they will fix the issues they've got. It's a difficult time for them, but we're supporting them in every way we can. And I think this is a really important inflection time for Boeing and for the entire supply chain, one of my conversations with Stan, I said, about every 7 years, we all have to relearn certain disciplines in the aerospace industry, whether it's torquing fasteners or crimping connectors or fad awareness, and that's driven by 2 dynamics. One is changes in make or buy, where you had the supply chain where you have new players coming in that are less familiar. And the second is a change in the workforce makeup. And we certainly have that coming out of the pandemic, where companies like Spirit and Boeing and others have had a large influx of new employees. So the key is to put the controls in place and the culture that allows those newer employees and arm them with the tools to ensure quality. And that's exactly what Boeing is doing. And I'm confident they're going to get there until all the fixes are in place, you'll read about issues on the program. That's not to be -- not -- shouldn't be a surprise, but the additional attention and inspection levels that the aircraft is getting will help catch those. And the partnership with the FAA will help. And there'll be a time when they get over it. And then it's going to be, as Airbus has demonstrated, a steady progressive ramp and Prime's going to benefit from both of those."", 'Operator', 'The last question is a follow-up from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""Sorry, just a quick one. I think in the comments, you talked about the fourth quarter benefiting from price increases in selected IP sales. I just wanted to make sure that, that IP sale comment, is that similar to sort of the IP sales you've had in the past, like second quarter of last year where it's pretty chunky in terms of drop through to margins."", 'Daniel J. Crowley', 'Exactly.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', 'Do you have a size for that?', 'Daniel J. Crowley', ""I'd say $10 million to $13 million. It's a series of smaller ones. In the past, Triumph didn't prove the (inaudible) either at the operating company level or at the product line level. But the reality is products run their course. And I think Honeywell is probably a good benchmark for this. They do a good job of looking at every product line and saying, Hey, which ones are worth more to others than they are to us and monetizing them and in Q2 of last year, there was a dip because GE pushed out a lot of the LEAP deliveries and then they turned the throttles on, and we had a very strong Q3 and Q4 I think you're going to see the same thing in our Q4, where we have a lot of pent-up demand and carryover from Q3. And I expect all of my presidents to bring these items forward. If they're not, it suggests that they're not questioning and really scrutinizing their portfolio, and they're carrying products that are either aged out or no longer profitable or require a disproportionate level of resources. So that's the contribution. And you can count on us to continue to do that opportunistically in fiscal '25."", 'Operator', ""This concludes our question-and-answer session and Triumph Group's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call.""]"

The answer is not finding a way to infinite growth.""', 'However, these same sources acknowledged that Darrell is up against several formidable forces in his bid to transform VF Corp. into a nimbler, more profitable retailer.', 'The first is a company history of going big on dealmaking at almost any cost, often encouraged by growth-hungry Wall Street.', ""VF Corp.'s former CEOs of the past 20 years, Mackey McDonald, Eric Wiseman, and the most recent predecessor, Steve Rendle, all had transformative acquisitions during their tenures."", 'McDonald plunked down $396 million for skater lifestyle brand Vans in 2004. Wiseman purchased boot maker Timberland for $2 billion in 2011. And Rendle spent close to $3 billion to buy workwear play Dickies in 2017 and streetwear seller Supreme in 2020.', 'These deals helped build the modern-day VF Corp., which has a portfolio anchored by outdoor label The North Face that has long benefited from economies of scale and internal idea sharing between the brands.', 'In part fueled by pressure from activist investor Engaged Capital, Darrell has come out of the gate with a mindset of ""no sacred cows"" to unlock earnings growth.', ""He has outlined $300 million in cost cuts, put backpack brands Kipling, Eastpak, and JanSport up for sale, and slashed the company's dividend by 70% in October. All not even a year into the new gig."", ""The struggling Vans brand — commanding most of Darrell's attention right now — went through a thorough product review that may help to stabilize the business within 18 months. But Darrell was hesitant to say when the skater culture-led Vans will return to growth."", ""On the company's earnings call late Tuesday, Darrell took things a step further by announcing a strategic portfolio review. In retail, that often equates to the sell-off of a host of lagging brands to maximize shareholder value."", ""Darrell also didn't shoot down the notion of a more extensive slimming down when speaking with Yahoo Finance, and didn't rule out a potential sale of boot-hawking legend Timberland."", '""I think that\'s kind of a fundamental question of ownership: Should we be in it?"" Darrell said of the portfolio review, adding that Timberland is a ""fantastic"" brand.', ""Sources told Yahoo Finance that these efforts, from cost cuts to asset sales, will help immediately address concerns about VF Corp.'s roughly $5.2 billion in debt that was built up during its decades-long acquisition spree."", '""He has to get this debt down for investors to feel more comfortable,"" a source said.', '""This is the first time I\'ve run a company that had debt,"" Darrell said. ""This is new to me.""', '""Personally, of course, we have all felt that,"" he added. ""But I don\'t like that. My most sleepless nights of my life, I was worried about money. So I don\'t want to be worried about money — and I\'m not worried about money here. ... We\'re going to break down that debt.""', ""Other headwinds for VF Corp. weighed on the company's financial performance over the last two years. The company has faced prolonged traffic weakness at US department stores and lost touch with consumer wants in the Vans division. Meanwhile, another force of nature — warm weather stunting demand for outerwear — hasn't helped."", ""These challenges were front and center in the company's most recent quarter. Sales fell in every one of VF Corp.'s divisions. Vans led the decline with a steep 28% sales drop. Timberland sales declined by 21%, The North Face fell by 10%, and Dickies decreased by 16%."", 'The company lost $32.2 million on an operating basis in the quarter, which incorporated $50.9 million in severance charges and $257.1 million in goodwill impairment charges for Timberland and Dickies.', '""I\'m just really excited about the future,"" Darrell told Yahoo Finance, ""and I don\'t get too caught up in anything that has happened.""', ""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

He also gained rich experience as an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Having also doubled up as analyst covering media and internet segment at Kicap Management, he is currently the Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer at Dorsal Capital Management.', 'Evans has been a retired partner since 2014 and currently manages direct public equity at the family offices of Apercus Holdings and Keystone LP. Having completed his MBA at the Harvard Business School in 2004, he also worked as an analyst at CR Intrinsic for two years before founding Dorsal Capital Management.', 'Dorsal Capital Management mostly invests in technology stocks that account for about a third of the total portfolio.

However, the Redwood City, California-based hedge fund is not open to funds from outside investors.', 'As of the third quarter of 2023, Dorsal Capital Management had stakes in some of the biggest tech companies that fueled the bull run in 2023. The long-short hedge fund boasts of investments in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) that posted triple and double-digit percentage gains in 2023. Likewise, the hedge fund finished 2023 on a high, up\xa0by about 13%.', 'The tech services and consumer-focused hedge fund manages about $2.92 billion while applying long- and short-term investment strategies. In addition, it considers itself an expert in managing pooled investment vehicles. Investments in tech stocks allow the hedge fund to gain exposure to some of the fastest growth areas at a time of artificial intelligence operations. Investments in consumer goods also offer exposure to inflation-immune segments.', 'While the hedge fund underperformed the S&P 500, which gained 24% in 2023, its returns showed a significant improvement from 2022. As the overall equity market came under pressure in 2022 amid a ferocious sell-off triggered by runaway inflation and a push by the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, Dorsal Capital Management narrowly escaped losses with a 0.9% decline. The 0.9% decline in 2022 was impressive considering that the S&P 500 was down by about 19% the same year.', ""Dorsal Capital Management's impressive track record of returns dates back to 2018, when it\xa0delivered a gain of 2.18%\xa0\xa0compared to a loss of 4.38% for the S&P 500. The hedge fund continued the impressive run in 2019 as it delivered a half-year return of 7.4% through June 2019 with an\xa0annualized return of 7.5%. Even as the COVID-19 pandemic caused havoc in 2020, sending the markets into a tailspin, the hedge fund came on top, delivering 9.7% gains in the year's first half. The impressive run would continue into 2021 as the hedge fund achieved a 4.1% return."", ""Investments in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Amazon.com, Inc.

Cybersecurity Breach Disrupts Business Operations', ""VF's Reinvention Leads to 500 Layoffs"", 'Just about everything at the once staid and steady company is in motion.', 'In an interview with WWD, Darrell offered a peek at his management style, his outsider view on fashion and his enthusiasm for the wayward Vans brand. Darrell generally gave the air of a happy warrior taking on his next big task with eyes wide open.', 'Still, he’s not sugar coating much these days. Darrell described VF’s third-quarter to analysts as “terrible,” a fair assessment with double-digit declines across all the major businesses, including Vans, Timberland and even The North Face, which was strong until recently.', 'But transparency is something the former Logitech CEO and Procter & Gamble veteran has grown into, even when it comes to managing the guessing game of who stays and who goes as the company pushes through the crucible.', '“Early in my career, I would’ve said, well, let’s not talk about it broadly until we absolutely have to, because we don’t want to give people anxiety for no reason because 99 percent or 95 percent of the people who work here are going to work here a year from now,” Darrell said.', 'Now, he’s letting it all hang out.', '“Transparency to me is more important than even avoiding the anxiety that could come with it. For most people, they’d rather know that they’re working for somebody they trust than have the anxiety of a little instability.”', 'It’s a point well made, but there’s a little more than a little instability right now at VF.', 'Shares of the company fell 9.7 percent to $15.31 on Wednesday —\xa0giving VF a market capitalization of $6 billion, a big drop from the nearly $40 billion at the start of 2020.', 'The portfolio review the group officially unveiled on Tuesday raises the question of just what the company will look like in the near future.', 'Already, VF has been shopping its Kipling, Eastpak and JanSport backpack businesses. The question now is, which is the next brand on the chopping block? Supreme? Timberland? Dickies? (Last year, activist investor Engaged Capital pushed for the company to consider selling off all of its brands outside of Vans and The North Face.)', 'While Darrell telegraphed the portfolio review earlier, analysts were surprised by the quarter’s sales declines, which led to a net loss of $42.5 million, down from earnings of $507.9 million a year earlier.', '“You know things are bad when management starts flying commercial,” wrote Tom Nikic, an analyst at Wedbush, in a research note that described VF as “a highly challenged business.”', 'Ike Boruchow, analyst at Wells Fargo, said “there was nothing good” in the quarterly report, adding: “The turnaround plan just became that much harder. All three big brands are trending negative.”', 'VF said on Tuesday that chief financial officer Matt Puckett would be leaving after a transition period, another change that analysts saw as adding complexity to the company.', 'Clearly, Darrell is firmly focused on getting to a future where VF is growing again. But with this sharp a downturn at a company that for years was the stand-out operator in fashion, he did, when pressed, offer something of a diagnosis of what went wrong.', '“This company really ran the play so well when we brought in brands that were kind of in trouble but needed fixing,” the CEO said. “And the fix for us was we ran them efficiently. We had a supply chain that was rock solid, and we gave those people who were running those brands enough independence that they could come up with new products and do well. So it was really kind of really nuts and bolts, good solid stuff. We were in the right place at the right time. We picked the right categories.”', 'Then, he said, VF simply “lost the plot a little bit.”', '“If it hadn’t been them.…I probably would’ve done the same thing when the gravy train was really running well. I think we probably didn’t keep the innovation lights on as strongly as we could have. My experience with products is, if you don’t have great product, you don’t have a great company for very long.”', 'Vans, which for years was a powerhouse for VF, is a good example.', 'While the company is working to bring in a new head for the business, Darrell has been rolling up his sleeves and digging into how the brand works.', '“I’ll avoid all the business speak,” he said. “It’s super fun. I mean, the brand has such an amazing history. My tendency with brands and businesses is always to go to the start with the history, because usually the answer to the unlock is somewhere in the past, and it’s like an archeological dig to find the pieces that can help you discover the future.', '“It was really this kind of brand that stood for the youth and what you wore when you were young and feeling kind of independent and not like everybody else,” he said.', 'But as the brand got bigger, it kept churning out its classic looks. It was an approach that worked well — until it didn’t as the fashion trend finally moved on quicker than the brand could react.', 'The once bulletproof VF organizational structure is also being revamped, with a global commercial structure that for the first time also sits over the Americas business, which has a new set-up.', 'One of the changes is a division of labor that separates the job of getting the design and brand right and the task of executing on the business side.', '“The dividend on this one’s going to be big,” said Darrell, who knows he’s running a little countertrend.', '“The pushback on this is always the same, which is, ‘Wait a minute, you want to have somebody who can control…from the brand creation all the way into the store,’” he said.', 'The CEO called that “a luxury view of the world.”', '“You want one continuous flow right into there,” he said. “But unless you’ve got a luxury brand’s margins, you really can’t afford to staff that.”', 'While the consumer market has become a little iffy, particularly with U.S. wholesalers, Darrell is focused internally, not externally.', '“It’s a pretty good world out there,” he said, adding that not so long ago a soft landing for the economy after the pandemic seemed “impossible.”', '“At a very, very macro level, we’re in a pretty first world situation here,” he said. “Companies like us shouldn’t complain too much. We just need to better innovate, better market and make sure the value’s there because the market’s there.”', 'So the mission is to reinvent at VF and reconnect with the market.', 'With all the moving parts, it might look like a rush from the outside, but Darrell sees something else.', '“Believe it or not, I feel like we’re pacing this,” he said. “I realize we’re moving very fast, but I think it’s better to clean the table. Whatever pain you need to take, whatever products you need to be returned from wholesale, get it done early. Don’t drag that through the next several years.”', 'That goes for management changes too.', '“Twelve years ago, I probably would’ve waited a year or two,” he said. “Now let’s do it early. If I learned one thing, it’s that these things don’t get better over time. They usually get worse. So just put them behind you. I want to solve problems now and then go forward and build and grow.

However, as estimated by analysts, the future payout ratio could be 31% over the same time period, which we think the company can easily maintain.', ""The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.16 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 26% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period."", ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Zions Bancorporation National Association has impressed us by growing EPS at 7.4% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time."", ""Overall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Zions Bancorporation National Association might even raise payments in the future. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock."", ""Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

Wells, Krebs said, does this through its distinct three-channel structure.', ""That consists partly of a traditional wirehouse, where experienced advisory teams work predominantly with clients from the simply well-to-do to the ultrawealthy. Then there's the firm's bank-based channel, which allows customers in one of the firm's more than 4,500 bank branches to strike up relationships with advisors."", ""And there's its independent channel, Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or FiNet. This line of business — still unique among Wells' direct wirehouse competitors — allows financial planners to sign on as independent contractors while still enjoying support from Wells Fargo and access to its investing products."", ""Krebs said he's fully aware that most wealth managers have a preference for going independent, whether or not they have actually made such a move. A report released in December 2022 by the research firm Cerulli found that 71% of advisors would prefer working in an independent channel, even though only 44% had broken away from employment at a large firm."", 'Krebs called Wells Fargo\'s FiNet ""the only independent broker-dealer that can offer the full spectrum of solutions from both a brokerage and lending capability of a major wealth management firm.""', ""READ MORE: Shrinking headcounts a growing problemUBS's wealth goal: $5T under management in 5 yearsWells Fargo boosts CEO Scharf's pay to $29M for 2023Wells' comp grid dangles clear rewards before top producers"", 'Another industry trend not lost on Krebs is the quickening pace of retirements. A separate Cerulli report, released in January, estimates a third of all advisors will retire in the coming decade.', ""That's an alarming development in an industry in which three out of four new recruits notoriously end up not sticking around long enough to fashion a career. Krebs said he's optimistic Wells' bank channel can help backfill the ranks by giving newcomers a way into the industry without coming under pressure to build large books of business from scratch."", '""We have advisors that are joining our firm, who are perhaps newer in their careers,"" Krebs said. ""And they\'re entering into our bank channel, where there\'s great growth opportunities for partnering with other team members across the bank channels, and opportunities for referrals, etc.""', ""Krebs, who started his career at Merrill Lynch in 1998, comes into his new role after serving for five years as Wells' managing director and market leader for its New England and Upstate New York region. That previous position had him overseeing roughly 600 advisors, client associates and other staffers in six states."", ""His promotion is part of a larger management overhaul at the firm. He'll now report to Barry Simmons, the head of national sales whom Wells recruited in May from JPMorgan."", 'Wells has also appointed four divisional directors responsible for recruiting in specific regions of the country: Patrick Baumann in the Northeast; Jason McLaughlin in the central states; George Fekete in the Southeast; and Matt Arnold in the West.', 'Krebs sat down with Financial Planning on Tuesday to discuss his plans and what Wells can do to further stand out from its competitors. This article has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.', 'Financial Planning: Are these recent organizational changes a sign of an increased commitment to recruiting?', 'Brendan Krebs: I would say that it signifies a heightened emphasis and focus on certainly the growth opportunity that recruiting represents. But a real focus on extending our work to ensure that not only are we attracting the most successful and the most talented advisors and teams across the industry, but ultimately broadening that mandate so that we have an opportunity to help support those advisors.', ""Really, it's everything across the advisor life cycle. So when you think about advisors joining us, it's with goals around teaming and succession, practice management, looking to potentially bring in the next generation of advisors through our new advisor development program, looking for strategic growth opportunities, perhaps through external book acquisition. All of that now falls under my scope and my team's scope."", ""FP: How often does Wells' independent channel come up in your recruiting conversations?"", ""BK: Advisors who are looking at our independent channel, what they've come to recognize is that perhaps we are the only solution out there whereby they can continue to deliver all of the solutions that their clients need and have come to expect from a major wealth management firm, but also enjoy all the benefits and flexibility that comes with an independent offering. It's certainly an area that we continue to devote a lot of resources and support around."", ""I would also say, though, that when you think about Wells Fargo wealth investment, while independence is an incredible growth opportunity for us, we're also really excited about our bank-based channel. That really speaks to identifying ways to ensure that we're attracting advisors across the life cycle, right? It's not just highly talented, experienced and successful advisors, but also those advisors that have built a successful career in a bank-based brokerage model and are aspiring to enter into the wealth management spectrum."", ""By the way, we're expanding our bank branches with dedicated advisors to ensure that we're positioning them to deliver the Wells Fargo Premier affluent client experience [for clients with $250,000 or more to invest]. This path is an excellent way for them to really continue to build their practice of access to bank referrals and then, at some point, perhaps consider a path to independence if that fits their career aspirations."", 'FP: Who is the ""bread and butter"" wealth management client for Wells? Is it the high net worth and ultrahigh net worth investors we hear so much about? Or are you also going for the so-called mass affluent market?', ""BK: We're really well positioned to offer advice and solutions to clients across their life cycle. You know, one of the areas that has been really rapidly growing that I mentioned is our Wells Fargo Premier model, which is a way for us to provide solutions to affluent clients."", 'Today, perhaps their relationship with Wells is exclusive to consumer banking. But having an opportunity to provide wealth management solutions through an introduction of a financial advisor is really important to our growth as a business, but also expanding from there, looking at our traditional wealth management business, serving the needs of the high net worth and the ultrahigh net worth clients across their life cycles as well.', ""FP: What sort of recruiting deals is Wells offering these days? We've seen reports they can run as high as 500% of an advisor's trailing 12 months of revenue. Are those accurate?"", ""BK: Similarly perhaps with most of our industry peers, we don't broadly disclose individual recruiting deals. And every transition package is unique to the advisor. Ultimately, what we try to present to a financial advisor or team that's considering joining us is the totality of what we can deliver to them and their practice."", 'I would just say that we have one of the best, if not the best, overall compensation offerings on the Street. And that would include, of course, a highly competitive transition package. But it also includes overall compensation plans or retirement programs.', 'FP: Pay policies also have a lot to do with advisor retention. What are you doing on the compensation front to keep your most productive teams around?', ""BK: More than anything, financial advisors tell us that they want to know that every single day they have the support and resources that they need to take care of their clients. That's paramount."", ""The other piece of it is, yes, certainly advisors want to know that they're affiliated with a firm that offers a best-in-class compensation offering across the spectrum of cash compensation, rewards recognition, and that's focused on all the right areas that the advisors are focused on, which is supporting clients and helping them be successful."", ""One of the beautiful things about our business is that our advisors, and ultimately the firms that they affiliate with like Wells Fargo, is that our success is entirely predicated on the success of our clients. So when you put that focus on supporting clients' success, and have that same level of success translate to our advisors, and ultimately our firm, it's a great proposition."", ""FP: Wells Fargo has stopped reporting its advisor headcount. The last time the number was aired, in 2023, it stood around 12,000. Can you shed some light on how many advisors are working in the firm's three channels today?"", ""BK: So, we no longer share advisor headcount. But what I can tell you is that we finished 2023 with our highest level of net advisor hiring in years. And that's an important trend that we obviously want to continue to focus on and grow.""]"

One is your desired annual income — $6,000 or $1,200 — and the other is the dividend yield of the stock, which is 6.32% in this case. So, $6,000 / 0.0632 = $94,936 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0632 = $18,987 for $100 per month."", 'To calculate a stock’s dividend yield, divide its annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock. The dividend yield may change over time. This can be attributed to the movements in stock prices and the changes in dividend payments on a rolling basis.', 'For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).', 'Considering the stock price remains unchanged, its dividend yield will increase when the company increases the dividend value and vice versa. So, the dividend yield is positively correlated to the dividend payments.', 'Disclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share on Feb. 6 using an annualized dividend.

Thousands die from it every month. And yet, an antiviral treatment proven to lessen the chances of severe outcomes is going underused.', 'The drug, Paxlovid, is lauded by experts as a powerful tool that can prevent hospitalization and death from COVID-19. But the high price and doctors’ hesitation to prescribe the pills mean the five-day treatment isn’t getting to everyone who would benefit from it.', '“When you read in your local newspaper that in this hospital, they’ve got this many COVID patients, most of those are preventable hospitalizations,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University who sees Paxlovid as a useful tool to treat COVID-19.', 'One Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that Paxlovid can decrease hospitalization risks among adults by 51%. The drug is recommended for older people and other adults with certain underlying conditions and can be prescribed for kids as young as 12.', 'When Paxlovid was first authorized for emergency use in the U.S. in December 2021, it was free for anyone who needed it. Once the government stopped funding the treatment, Pfizer set a list price of $1,390.', 'The drug remains free for people on federal insurance programs like Medicaid and Medicare through the end of this year, and uninsured people also can get it for free. But many of those people must go through a patient assistance program run by Pfizer to get the discounts. People on commercial insurance with high out-of-pocket costs can also get financial help through a separate co-pay assistance program.', 'Independent pharmacy owners find Paxlovid is expensive to carry because of reimbursement rates from commercial insurers, said Kurt Proctor, a senior vice president at the National Community Pharmacists Association.', '“If you’re losing 5% on a $10 prescription, it’s very different than losing 5% on a $1,400 prescription product,” he said.', 'The high list price also is turning off some patients.', 'When Celise Ballow, of Junction, Utah, got COVID-19 recently, she never got the medication.', 'Ballow said her doctor declined to write her a prescription after telling her it wouldn’t be covered by her insurance.

GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with FOXA.', ""On February 7, 2024, Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) filed its 10-Q report, providing a snapshot of its financial performance and strategic positioning. This SWOT analysis delves into the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, informed by the latest financial data. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, Fox Corp reported revenues of $4,234 million, a decrease from the $4,605 million reported in the same period the previous year. Operating expenses saw a slight reduction to $3,393 million from $3,528 million. Net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $109 million, down from $313 million, reflecting a decrease in earnings per share from $0.58 to $0.23. These figures indicate a challenging quarter for Fox Corp, with a notable decline in profitability."", ""Brand Power and Market Position: Fox Corp's brand strength, particularly in news and sports broadcasting, remains a formidable asset. The company's portfolio, including Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, and sports channels FS1 and FS2, commands significant audience loyalty and advertiser interest. Fox News continues to be a ratings powerhouse, often leading in viewership among cable news networks. The strategic bet on live sports and news has paid off, with live events driving consistent viewership and commanding premium advertising rates. The company's owned and operated local television stations further solidify its market presence, providing a direct connection to local audiences and advertisers."", ""Content and Rights Portfolio: Fox Corp's content strategy, emphasizing live sports and news, differentiates it from competitors who are more reliant on scripted content. The company's rights to broadcast major sports events, including NFL games and college sports through the Big Ten Network, provide a competitive edge. These live events are less susceptible to the shifts in consumer viewing habits that have impacted other forms of programming. Additionally, the Fox Studios lot offers strategic advantages in content production and ancillary revenue generation."", ""Digital Initiatives and Acquisitions: Fox Corp's digital expansion, exemplified by the growth of Tubi, its AVOD service, showcases the company's commitment to evolving with industry trends. Tubi's growth reflects a successful foray into the streaming space, offering a complementary platform to Fox's traditional broadcast and cable operations. The acquisition of Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm, also indicates Fox's willingness to diversify and innovate beyond its core media business."", 'Adaptation to Industry Shifts: Despite its strong brand and content offerings, Fox Corp faces challenges in adapting to the rapid shifts in the media landscape. The decline in traditional cable subscribers and the rise of streaming platforms necessitate a strategic response to retain and grow audiences. While Tubi represents a step in the right direction, Fox Corp must continue to invest in and promote its digital offerings to compete effectively with streaming giants.', ""High-Profile Legal Disputes: Fox Corp has been embroiled in high-profile legal disputes, including those related to allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at FOX News and defamation claims. These issues not only pose financial risks due to potential settlements and legal fees but also threaten the company's reputation and brand integrity. The settlement of the Dominion Voting Systems defamation lawsuit for approximately $800 million in April 2023 underscores the financial and reputational risks associated with such disputes."", ""Financial Performance: The recent decline in net income and earnings per share, as reported in the latest 10-Q filing, points to financial weaknesses that need to be addressed. The decrease in profitability may raise concerns among investors and could impact the company's ability to invest in growth initiatives. Managing costs and identifying new revenue streams will be crucial for improving financial health."", ""Digital and International Expansion: Fox Corp has the opportunity to further expand its digital footprint, both domestically and internationally. Tubi's growth can be accelerated by increasing investment in original content and expanding its availability in new markets. Additionally, leveraging Fox's strong brand, the company can explore international opportunities for its news and sports content, potentially opening up new revenue streams."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: Fox Corp can continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships that complement its core businesses.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Alex."", 'James Alexander Chriss', ""Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. It's been a productive first 4 months. I'm pleased with what we've been able to accomplish in such a short period of time while delivering the solid financial results we will discuss today. More importantly, I'm excited about the foundation we're setting and the velocity at which we're executing as we enter 2024. Today, I'd like to walk you through the changes we've made to the structure of our company, including several key additions to our leadership team, give a clear road map for how we will be executing going forward and share our strategic priorities for 2024. Jamie will take you through the fourth quarter and full year results in greater detail, but the headline is that we delivered a solid quarter during the most important shopping season for our customers. In Q4, we delivered 9% revenue growth on $410 billion in total payment volume. Transaction margin dollar performance was better than expected in the fourth quarter, and we continued strong expense discipline, reducing non-transaction-related expenses by 9% year-over-year. Taken together with $600 million in share repurchases in the quarter, our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% year-over-year. While these are solid results, we know there is still much room for improvement, and we're committed to making the necessary changes to our business and how we invest and operate to get it right. One of the key changes I talked about in our last earnings call was ensuring we have an outstanding leadership team in place. It's important to me that we have a leadership team with a broad diversity of experience, deep operational rigor and leaders with track records of success. I'm thrilled with the talent that we've assembled in the last few months. With Jamie as our new CFO; Isabel Cruz, leading people in places; Michelle Gill, leading Small Business & Financial Services; Suzan Kereere, leading Global Markets; Diego Scotti, leading Consumer and Global Marketing and Communications, combined with talented leaders who have risen within PayPal, we have a world-class leadership team in place to help the organization reach its full potential. Each of these leaders chose to join PayPal because they see the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us to reshape commerce and are already driving a renewed energy within the company. Second, we've organized our teams around the customers we serve, consumers, small businesses and enterprises. This creates clear lines of accountability and will enable teams to focus on delivering the right solutions that address our customers' greatest needs. Regardless of the customer we're serving, we want to make the PayPal offering so user-friendly, so rewarding and so integrated into a customer's life that PayPal is the obvious choice. Our new structure enables that. Third, last week, we announced that we will reduce our global workforce by approximately 9% through both direct reductions and the elimination of open roles over the course of the year. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, our size has been slowing us down. While this was not an easy decision to make, this change is necessary to execute with the focus and speed required to drive our next chapter of growth and allow us to invest in our future. With these changes, we continue to reprioritize and invest in the innovation and delivery of products and solutions that offer the greatest impact for our customers. The team has been very focused on building out our strategy and driving focused execution for 2024. These are the most important priorities we're focused on this year, accelerating growth in our branded checkout business, improving overall profitability, including that of our high-growth PSP services, unlocking the power of data to create more value for our customers while tapping into new sources of revenue and margin and operating more efficiently. Our first look, customer announcement 2 weeks ago was an initial demonstration of the importance of delivering compelling value propositions to consumers and merchants. As promised, we're doing a lot of things to drive change internally and externally. However, nothing happens overnight. It will take time for some of our initiatives to scale and move the needle, but the initial customer reaction and merchant demand for our new innovations has been encouraging. 2024 is going to be a transition year, focused on execution to position the business for long-term success. Our clear goal is to reshape the company to accelerate profitable growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. Prioritization will be key allowing us to move more quickly and with better results. Later in the call, Jamie will take you through our full year guidance. We have made strategic decisions to reinvest cost savings back into our most important initiatives. It is critical that we remain on offense and position ourselves to not only innovate but capture our share of the growth in global commerce. We want to be clear-eyed in terms of the potential near-term benefits from our initiatives, which is why our 2024 guidance includes minimal contribution from the innovations we recently announced. We want to see execution and clear results prior to embedding these initiatives into our financial outlook. As a company, we will build back a track record of delivering on our commitments. In November, I committed to being transparent with you all on how we will run the business. I want to spend a few minutes to share our operating principles and how we expect these will drive value creation over time. Our 5 operating principles are: number one, start with the customer. I believe in working customer back. We will start by defining our customers and their most critical needs. Then we will use that knowledge to inform everything we do, including investments and innovation. Number two, focus on profitable growth. We will prioritize high-quality, profitable growth and driving improved transaction margin dollars through more rigor and discipline. Number three, drive operating leverage over time. We will combine our assets and data to develop more personalized experiences for our customers and drive efficiencies across the business to leverage our cost base. Number four, set measurable goals and communicate consistently. We say what we mean and mean what we say, we will be transparent and accountable for our performance; and number five, maintain a strong balance sheet. We will be diligent in managing our resources and returning excess cash to our shareholders. These 5 principles will guide how we make decisions and will ultimately keep us accountable to deliver what we say we will do. Let me now take you through what this means for how we serve our customers and what we're focused on in 2024. For enterprises, we're focused on accelerating growth in branded checkout and driving the profitable growth of our PSP services this year. Branded checkout is a critical part of PayPal's value proposition. We need to ensure we have our best checkout experience available to every consumer on every merchant every time. This will be a multiyear effort. To start, we've redesigned our branded checkout experience, creating more simplicity and consistency with the goal of optimizing presentment, increasing speed and minimizing friction across all major checkout flows. When combined with our efforts in password-less authentication, these new flows can result in up to an additional 50% drop in latency, allowing a shopper to check out twice as fast. Improvements like this are aimed at driving a higher selection rate of PayPal and better conversion for our merchants. A challenge in the past has been bringing existing merchants on to our latest integrations and experiences. This is one of the reasons why our new guest checkout experience Fastlane by PayPal is so exciting. It's truly differentiated and will provide a compelling reason for merchants to operate. With it, we can recognize up to 70% of guests visiting a merchant, reduced checkout time by up to 40% and grow the top of our branded checkout funnel. BigCommerce, one of our long-time partners has already implemented Fastlane on their platform, and the conversion of their merchants using this new solution is as high as 79%. Combining solutions like Fastlane with a full suite of PSP offerings and more targeted, personalized commerce experiences creates a powerful end-to-end suite of capabilities that drive higher sales for merchants and gives them more reason to choose PayPal. We're focused on driving profitable growth, including within our PSP services like Braintree. The team continues to earn market share and merchant confidence through product and performance enhancements, delivering auth rate improvements of up to 240 basis points for enterprise customers in the U.S. We're continuing to build out and seamlessly integrate additional value-added services in areas like orchestration, routing optimization, payouts and risk as a service in addition to serving as a seamless integration point for our latest branded checkout experiences, including PayPal, Venmo and Buy Now, Pay Later. We will be able to compete in the market with a best-in-class offering and price to value. In addition, we're putting greater discipline into our go-to-market and renewal processes as we focus on profitable growth. These areas take time to scale, but we're laser-focused on them and expect to make steady progress this year. For small businesses, we're on a journey to move from a variety of standalone products to a modern platform with a comprehensive suite of solutions. What this means in 2024 is that we're focused on accelerating the adoption of PayPal Complete Payments, or PPCP, through a reinvigorated go-to-market approach for partners and developers. This full stack solution enables us to distribute our best branded checkout flow to SMBs while also competing for the approximately $750 billion addressable market of processing volumes. We've had limited penetration of SMB full stack processing to date due to the lack of a strong product, but that is now changing. November and December were record-setting months for new SMB adoption of PPCP. We're seeing lower churn rates for merchants on PPCP year-over-year, but we've also seen increases in transaction volume for merchants migrating to full stack processing from our legacy products. As the year progresses, we intend to drive additional adoption through partner channels, targeted marketing and developer-friendly capabilities like low- and no-code integration paths available through our brand new developer portal. Over time, we want to better serve other important SMB needs, offering more ways to help them connect to new customers. It's also worth noting that all the checkout improvements I just discussed as part of our enterprise strategy can also benefit the tens of millions of SMBs that use PayPal. For consumers, we're focused on differentiating our value proposition, deepening existing relationships and giving shoppers more reasons to choose PayPal. PayPal already has strong consumer awareness and trust, but that is not enough to compete in today's world. Part of a person's decision to choose PayPal comes down to presentment, ease of use and speed, areas where we still have room to improve. We also want to give consumers more reasons to choose PayPal by delivering personal lines and rewarding shopping experiences that also drive higher conversion for merchants. This year, we're launching and evolving a new PayPal app to create [a situation]. We will also leverage our merchant relationships and the power of AI to make the entire shopping experience personalized for consumers while giving them control over their data. In addition, we will drive increased understanding and awareness of Why PayPal via sustained marketing efforts. Our goal is to drive quality customer growth over time as well as deeper relationships that include more frequent use and a greater range of product adoption. The new checkout and app experiences we are rolling out this year will also create an engagement loop that will drive higher awareness of the various products we offer and drive higher adoption of our portfolio over time. Let me give you 2 examples of where we have significant opportunity to drive increased adoption. In the U.S., we have over 27 million active accounts using PayPal Rewards. In the fourth quarter, rewards accounts had higher engagement and average revenue per account that was almost double that of non-rewards accounts. The average revenue per account of someone who adopts the PayPal Cashback Mastercard is about 5x higher than the average checkout-only account. Today, only about 2% of active accounts have that card in their wallet. Increasing adoption of these products will not only drive a richer experience for our customers but improvement in customer engagement and lifetime value for us. Redesigning our app and creating improved frictionless onboarding paths are tangible ways that we plan to drive higher penetration of these types of products. We're also bringing more functionality and better experiences to Venmo this year, like the ability to connect consumers with cash back offers from small businesses in their local communities. In addition to this innovation, we're focused on driving adoption of the Venmo debit card. Venmo debit card holders are among our most engaged accounts and drive 6x the incremental revenue than that of a P2P only customer, about 6% of our active Venmo customers have a Venmo debit card today. So there is a significant opportunity there for us to focus on. Finally, this year, we will demonstrate meaningful progress towards operating more efficiently. We've already consolidated many disparate technology services into common platforms. So we have more work to unleash the power of our data in service of our customers. We're simplifying and automating manual processes and investing in tools and services needed to drive productivity and innovation velocity. This will reduce cost and complexity, improve the developer experience and give more reasons for customers to choose PayPal. For example, we're converging to a single merchant reporting system, so that our merchants will get consistent and accurate reports, which will make a huge difference in how they run their business. Another outcome of consolidating platforms is that we will now see one view of the customer, which allows us to more effectively cross-sell the various products we offer. We will be moving at lightning speed and with the weight of the company behind each of these initiatives to deliver the best experiences possible for our customers this year. To wrap up, I am pleased with our fourth quarter results and the execution that the team delivered throughout the quarter amid an enormous amount of change. I'm excited about the year ahead and all the innovation we have in store for our customers. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jamie to take you through our results for the fourth quarter and full year."", 'Jamie S. Miller', ""Thanks, Alex. Good afternoon. First, let me say that I'm very excited to have joined PayPal. Our new leadership team is laser-focused on our customers, and I am incredibly energized to see our team come together to deliver PayPal's full potential. Before I discuss our financial results, you'll notice several things different in our materials today. First, we've redesigned our press release in a more standardized tabular format designed to allow ease of use and better consumption of information. We have also included additional supplemental metrics in our investor presentation intended to provide greater transparency into our business. We will continue to evaluate these and other changes over time. I'll start with a summary of our financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we reported 9% revenue growth on a spot and currency-neutral basis. For the full year, revenue grew 8% at spot and 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars were flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter and declined 1% for the full year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.48 in the quarter, representing 19% year-over-year growth. Higher earnings per share in the quarter were driven by ongoing expense discipline and better-than-expected transaction margin dollars, which benefited from branded checkout, Braintree and interest on customer balances. We ended the full year with $5.10 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 24%. Our full year results benefited from lower operating expenses, the higher interest rate environment and the impact of share buybacks. Now I'll walk you through some key operating metrics that support these results. We ended the year with 426 million active accounts and 224 million monthly active accounts. Throughout last year, we indicated that we expected ongoing churn of unengaged accounts in less developed markets, predominantly in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. This was the primary driver of our year-over-year reduction in total active accounts. We had modest growth in monthly active accounts, up 1% for both the quarter and the full year, and our active base of engaged counts remain stable. More than 50% of our total active accounts were monthly actives over the course of 2023. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing 12-month number, was 58.7 in the fourth quarter, up 14%. If we exclude PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree from that figure, transactions per active account grew 7%. Part of this growth rate is driven by the churn of unengaged accounts that I just mentioned, but we were also encouraged by the higher activity levels we're seeing among our core base of accounts. Page 14 in our investor presentation includes additional information on our historical trends in monthly active accounts and transactions per active account, excluding PSP processing. On volume growth in the fourth quarter, we saw total payment volume, or TPV, of $409.8 billion, representing 15% growth at spot and 13% growth on a currency-neutral basis. This growth was driven primarily by Braintree as well as branded checkout and Venmo. U.S. TPV grew 11%, International TPV grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by strength in Europe and improvement in Asia. For the full year, TPV was $1.5 trillion, increasing 13% at spot and 12% on a currency-neutral basis. PayPal's fourth quarter global branded checkout volumes grew by approximately 5% on a currency-neutral basis, bringing full year branded checkout volume growth to 6%. We have seen a solid start to the year with consistent global branded checkout growth through January. PSP processing volumes grew 29% in the quarter, driven by ongoing growth in Braintree. The team continues to make product and performance enhancements for merchants. We are also putting greater discipline into our go-to-market and renewal processes as we focus on overall profitable growth. With respect to revenue, as I noted earlier, revenue in the fourth quarter increased 9% on a spot and currency-neutral basis to $8 billion. Transaction revenue grew 9% on a spot basis to $7.3 billion, driven by Braintree and branded checkout. In the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue grew 8%. International revenue increased 10% at spot and 12% on a currency-neutral basis, accelerating from the third quarter. Similar to TPV, we saw ongoing strength in Europe and improvements in Asia. For the full year, U.S. revenue grew 9% and international revenue increased 7% at spot and 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Other value-added services revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a spot basis to $743 million. For the full year, other value-added services revenue grew 26% or by approximately $600 million. For both the quarter and the full year, this growth was driven almost entirely by increased interest income on customer stored balances. Transaction take rate declined 10 basis points to 1.78% in the fourth quarter. Approximately 7 bps of this decline was driven by 2 factors: lower gains from foreign currency hedges, which are recorded as international transaction revenue and flat foreign exchange fees. In addition, mix shift with higher volumes from large merchants continued to have a slight impact on our branded checkout take rate. Transaction take rate for the full year was 1.76%, also down 10 basis points year-over-year. Transaction margin dollars were flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a 3.5% decline in the third quarter. This approximate 4 percentage point improvement was driven by a combination of the absence of merchant contractual compensation in the prior year period and by branded checkout and Braintree. The growth of interest income on customer stored balances and growth of branded checkout were the largest contributors to transaction margin dollars in the fourth quarter. This growth was offset by the absence of hedge gains compared to the prior year period as well as declines in other parts of the portfolio, including the impact of migrating and consolidating legacy PayPal payment services. Fourth quarter transaction expense as a rate of TPV came in at 97 basis points, 4 basis points higher than the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by Braintree volume growth and was partially offset by a favorable geographic mix of PayPal volumes and rate benefits in Venmo. Full year transaction expense as a rate of TPV was 94 basis points. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was 7 basis points for the quarter, up 1 basis point from the fourth quarter last year and 8 basis points for the full year. Credit losses were $119 million for the quarter or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV, down 32% year-over-year and 3 basis points as a rate of TPV for the full year. We have taken a prudent and active approach to managing our overall credit risk, tightening originations within our PayPal business loans portfolio and externalizing our European Buy Now, Pay Later portfolio. In the fourth quarter, non-transaction-related operating expenses declined 9% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure. For the full year, the same expenses declined 11%. Non-GAAP operating income grew 11% in the quarter to nearly $1.9 billion and for the full year by 14% to $6.7 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23.3% in the quarter and increased 110 basis points to 22.4% for the full year due to better operating expense leverage in each period. PayPal generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter. This includes a $1.7 billion net benefit from the sale of our European Buy Now, Pay Later receivables to KKR, partly offset by the impact of new loans originated as held for sale. Adjusting for this impact, we generated nearly $800 million in adjusted free cash flow in the quarter and $4.6 billion for the full year. Higher-than-expected changes in working capital and cash taxes had a negative impact on fourth quarter free cash flow. In the quarter, we completed more than $600 million in share repurchases, bringing full year share repurchases to approximately $5 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $17.3 billion and debt of $11.3 billion. Before turning to our first quarter and 2024 guidance, I have 2 updates to our guidance approach to share. First, for the time being, we intend to move away from providing annual revenue guidance and instead provide guidance for the upcoming quarter. Given the considerable changes underway at the company, we believe it is prudent to guide revenue 1 quarter ahead and provide updates as the year progresses. Second, the first quarter and 2024 guidance that we're providing today excludes the impact of stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP results. This is consistent with our historical approach. Beginning in the first quarter, we will include stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. We will update our reporting and guidance accordingly at that time. Stock-based compensation is an integral part of our cost structure and one that we believe we need to manage more directly and transparently. Including stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP earnings, we'll introduce more accountability and discipline and will align our own performance measures to the way that many investors already evaluate our business. In terms of our outlook for the first quarter, we expect revenue to increase approximately 6.5% at spot and 7% on a currency-neutral basis. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter to grow at a mid-single-digit percentage. With respect to our full year financial plan, as we have said previously, with all of the changes we are making, 2024 will be an execution year and one we're positioning the business for long-term success will be critical. For the full year, we are planning for a relatively consistent macroeconomic environment with some level of interest rate declines as we move through the year. We also assume that overall consumer spending and activity levels will remain relatively consistent. We expect full year 2024 non-GAAP EPS to be roughly in line with prior year EPS of $5.10. Underpinning our outlook, we expect roughly flat transaction margin dollars. Alex discussed our innovation and product enhancements earlier. Many of these are already in pilot or launch, but will require execution throughout the year before we begin to see impact. Our guidance includes minimal impact from these initiatives. We expect a low single-digit increase in non-transaction operating expense. As Alex mentioned, we announced actions last week to reduce cost to drive continued efficiencies while at the same time, investing more in our product engineering and platform teams to drive growth. There are 2 factors to be mindful of that will impact our other value-added services revenue. First, while we are still seeing benefit from the higher interest rate environment, we expect that this tailwind will be much less significant in 2024. Second, we continue to take an active and prudent approach to managing our credit exposure. We are carrying lower credit receivables after tightening originations last year. And for our off-balance sheet originations, we are planning for ongoing normalization and loss rates, which will impact the revenue share that we earn. We expect free cash flow for 2024 to be approximately $5 billion. From a financial policy perspective, we remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Absent inorganic growth opportunities, we expect to continue allocating approximately 70% to 80% of our free cash flow to share buybacks. However, given our strong cash position as we enter the year, we are currently planning for at least $5 billion in share buybacks in 2024. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now hand it back over to the operator to begin Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.', 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""Appreciate all the details here. I wanted to dig in on the outlook for transaction margin dollars to be flat. Can you just give us a little bit more, maybe high-level thoughts on the key drivers there, and maybe some of the levers that are available to you to get the transaction margin dollar growth to accelerate beyond that in 2024. I get a lot of questions about it, obviously. So I'd love to hear the puts and takes that you would underline for us."", 'James Alexander Chriss', ""First, let me start just with recognizing how much change there is that we've gone through. You heard it in my prepared remarks, but we essentially have a brand-new executive leadership team. We've accelerated the pace of innovation. The first-look experience you saw a couple of weeks ago, really was innovation that could have taken months or years that I'm very proud of the team, accelerating and getting done in 60 days. And we are at a point now where even our mindset shift, this focus on profitable growth is something that's new for the organization, and we are grinding away every day. And so with that said, let me unpack the components of transaction margin growth. The way I think about it is there's 3 levers there. The first is really around the branded experience. This is a proven experience for us. It's one that we -- in some of the innovations that we put out, both for merchants that improve their experience as well as consumers with a new app that allows them to get through the experience better. That is a significant lever for us. And one that, to be honest, we've under-invested in. And if I take just specifically the mobile experience for our consumers, has been underwhelming. And it's something that with the new innovations we just rolled out, I expect for us to be able to continue to see improvement there. The second is around the unbranded processing. This is an area that we have invested significantly in. With Fastlane now, we have really, I believe, one of the best products in the market for our merchants. We're seeing the highest conversion rates out there, and it's something that our merchants are looking for and looking to adopt. We also are looking to move into new areas for growth that have higher margin opportunities such as international and small business. And it allows us to actually have different conversations with our customers and really price to value the product. And the third is really what I'd consider a bucket of value-added services. This is a combination of improving our flows with our consumers to ensure that we're attaching the products that we need to whether it's Buy Now, Pay Later or our Cashback Mastercard, these are flows that we've not optimized and were underperforming when it comes to really attach. And then some of the new offerings that we rolled out, you saw our advanced offerings platform as well as smart receipts. These are all ways that we can monetize and improve the connection between our merchants and consumers. So that's different ways that I think about the components."", 'Jamie S. Miller', ""Yes. And Tien-Tsin, I'll jump in on the '24 specific puts and takes on transaction margin dollars. And first, you heard us both say earlier that on the initiatives that Alex has been talking about, we have included limited impact on that in our guidance. But if I pull back, really, we're viewing largely steady trends to what you saw last year, maybe in slightly different proportions. So Branded Checkout being a healthy contributor to growth, improvement in our PSP margin profile. We expect some benefit in our interest income on customer balances, but really, that should be much smaller than what we saw last year. And we do expect some headwinds to our credit revenue, which as I think, as I mentioned in the script on the call, with loss rate normalization happening to pre-pandemic levels and that trend is starting to work. We'll just see lower rev share from our partnerships in that space. And then offsetting that, we really see also that some of our smaller product lines in the aggregate will be a drag on TM. This will be to a much lower extent than last year. But in areas where we do platform consolidation, there are times we deprecate products to really push customers to new platforms. Good example of that is PPCP, we do see some drop-off. And we've got a few other products that, as you know, we have not invested as heavily as perhaps we should have in the last couple of years. And as we work our way through that, there'll be some offset there."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.', 'Jason Alan Kupferberg', ""I wanted to hone in on branded TPV growth a bit. I think it slowed by 1 point in the fourth quarter to 5%. Was hoping you could maybe take us through some of the monthly intra-quarter trends there, any market share observations you might have had from holiday season. And then just some general comments on what you're planning for on branded TPV growth in the first quarter and full year '24?"", 'James Alexander Chriss', ""Thanks, Jason. Let me set the context and I'll see if Jamie wants to pile on. Our branded checkout performance was 6% for the year. It's been pretty consistent. And for what we're looking going into next year, we're expecting it to be consistent as well. And as we've talked about, that doesn't include or includes minimal aspects of the new innovations that we put out there. Let me talk about just some of the levers when it comes to the new innovations or ways that I think about accelerating branded checkout because this obviously is going to be a big focus for the organization. The first is we really have to improve the value proposition for our consumers. This is why you see us leaning into rewards, ensuring that we've got an improved experience that reduces latency and really leaning in on mobile as well so that our consumers have a better branded checkout experience. Second, the acceleration of Fastlane when it comes to our merchants not only improves the unbranded opportunity where we can see 70% of the customers that come through the Fastlane experience, but allows us to have a second engagement with our customers and bring them back into a branded experience at a later date, show them all the different reasons why they should be using PayPal or getting a reward back for a purchase that they made. So I think these, again, are just a couple of examples of innovations that we're leaning into now that allow us to really focus on that branded experience."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.', 'Darrin David Peller', ""Alex, Jamie, just to follow up a bit on some of this train of thought. I mean I know you're mentioning you're not incorporating these new initiatives in your transaction profit growth thoughts for this year. But when we think about some of these -- I mean most of these to your point, Alex, are going to be beneficial to gross profit growth. And so I guess we'd love to hear a little bit more around what you'd measure us, how you would measure success, whether it's the PPCP initiatives or unbranded as well as the branded checkout experience, what KPI should we look for? And I guess a little bit more on timing. If not this year, when do you want investors to expect some traction in actual gross profit re-acceleration?"", 'James Alexander Chriss', ""Yes. Well, thank you, Darrin. And look, let me be clear. We are not putting in the expectations into the guidance until we see execution. We just think it's prudent for us to put points on the board before we put it into the guidance. That said, the teams are grinding on this every single day. We are having conversations with our merchants and introducing them. As I mentioned on the call, the reaction has been quite encouraging from the innovations. There is demand in the market, and we are starting right now. And I will tell you, the conversations that we're having now that we're focused on both innovations that are driving demand as well as improvements for these merchants are different than we've had in the past. So I just want you to know, we are working now on this, and we will update you as we start to see points on the board and adjust our guidance as needed. Secondly, back to your first question around how I think about this. Look, the thing I want you to take away from all of this innovation that we rolled out in first look is this is really changing the way we engage with our customers and our merchants. We are now creating experiences across the entire customer life cycle, not just at checkout. So we are driving not only a checkout improvement, the 50% improvement in latency being able to improve Fastlane, but now we're starting to see a customer value proposition with CashPass, giving rewards back to our customers so that they have a reason to choose PayPal at every purchase. We're improving the onboarding and the reboarding as they come back into the app and start to now attach our Mastercard or debit experiences or Buy Now, Pay Later. We're improving the post-purchase experience where we now have smart receipts or package tracking so that we can improve the engagement between our merchants and our consumers, and we now have an ongoing active use engagement. And then we're leaning into demand generation and actually solving the biggest challenge that our merchants have, which is finding new customers as we think about our Advanced Offers Platform or creating shopper insights so that our merchants can start to engage and personalize their experience through our data and through the AI that we can lean through. So the way I think about it is we are looking at the entire end-to-end experience, and we'll measure our success through the metrics that you have. It's going to turn into what does transaction margin look like? What are -- what does active use look like from our ongoing users? So that's how we think about it."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.', 'Michael Ng', ""I wanted to ask a question about PayPal's commitment to durable, high-quality profitable growth. How does that impact the pricing strategy in Braintree? What unprofitable is the system products will PayPal deemphasize? And how does that tie into your 2024 non-transaction OpEx outlook of flat?"", 'James Alexander Chriss', ""Great. Thanks, Mike. Let me talk about Braintree and then I'll have Jamie talk about potentially some of the other products and businesses. So let me take you back. Braintree, if you go back a few years ago, was really trying to establish itself in the market. It hasn't delivered at scale, and there were gaps in the product. We've invested heavily in the product and have really focused on some of the largest U.S. enterprise customers, which now have proven the scale while we've gotten the product to parity. Then you look at what we just rolled out with innovations like Fastlane, I think we've now leapfrogged the competition. So what does that allow us to do? It allows us to be the one-stop shop for merchants, it allows us to provide a best-in-class experience on auth rates and give them the ability to have not only the best processing and unbranded, but also package that with PayPal and with all the other ways that customers want to pay, including Buy Now, Pay Later. We now are shifting towards being able to have a price-to-value conversation with our merchants and being able to really start to think about how will we ramp up go to market for not only Braintree, but also PPCP. We also are now moving into markets that have higher margins. So international and small business with both Braintree and PPCP allow us to now, again, price to value and have different conversations. So that is how we think about it. We're not focused on unprofitable growth when it comes to Braintree. We think we now have the product in market to be able to compete effectively and win."", 'Jamie S. Miller', ""Yes. And Mike, on the other part of your question, I guess what I'd say is we are just doing too many things. And our biggest opportunity is that we have to make decisions to stop things and to really focus and that gets into market competitiveness. It gets into pricing, it gets into really leaning into market opportunity and really stopping doing things that prevent us from doing the right thing in those spaces. So we are knee deep in that right now. And so when we talk about a year of transformation and execution, that's exactly what we're talking about."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.', 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', 'I wanted to ask about how much leeway or opportunity you have to continue kind of taking out expenses while simultaneously executing on the growth strategy? How are you thinking about striking that balance sort of cost control versus growth? And I guess, how confident are you that you have room to do both?', 'Jamie S. Miller', ""Yes, I would say that is definitely an and, not an or. And that's exactly what we're doing with the workforce announcements we made a week ago and really taking that and putting that back into product into engineering and into marketing, we have got to invest deeply to grow this place. And it's really important for us to just set the company up for the future. And to do that, the innovation muscle, the commercial muscle means that rightsizing our expense levels isn't going to be something that we -- that is a won and done. We know we have significant opportunity to continue to be more efficient, be that through automation, be that through driving deeper productivity. And as we harvest that, that just gives us more levers to invest that are -- the right things for our profile as we go forward."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.', 'James Eugene Faucette', ""James, a quick clarification and I have a question for Alex. But you said that starting from the first quarter, you'll be including stock-based compensation in your non-GAAP rather than excluding it. So does that mean that if we just imagine that we fast forward a few months, that the non-GAAP earnings would be reduced by roughly that $1.8 billion. Just looking for a little bit of clarification there. And then, Alex, you made an interesting comment in terms of like feeling things are too big organizationally. But I'm wondering how you're feeling about the tech stack right now and the level of integration and where we're at from that perspective in terms of your ability to drive the kinds of improvements and perhaps add functionality to improve the customer experience."", 'Jamie S. Miller', ""Yes, James, on your first question, you have it exactly right. So beginning in the first quarter, we'll start including stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP and closer to that time, we'll do the look back where we'll provide the retrospective data so that we've got everything on a comparable basis. But yes, you're thinking about that right."", 'James Alexander Chriss', 'And then, James, on your question around the tech stack. Look, I\'ll be transparent. The company has gone through significant growth over the last few years and a lot of acquisitions. We have not invested enough in creating a single platform. That again slows us down when it comes to innovation, and it slows us down when it comes to being able to leverage the data across the ecosystem. We are investing heavily in that now and starting to see real improvement. I mentioned a couple of things on the call, but really being able to put out a reporting system that now sees across the entire ecosystem, being able to see a single view of the customer so that now we can provide innovations to customers but also actually be able to cross-sell and be able to say, ""hey, this is a customer that has this risk profile and should be in these 2 or 3 different products"", is a huge win for us as we start to consolidate. It also just accelerates our engineering velocity, being able to have a services-based engineering team that can build once and deploy across the entire ecosystem is the direction that we\'re heading in. And so you started to see that. We -- even the innovations that we just put out over the last couple of weeks weren\'t really possible without us being investing heavily in the platform. But I also would say we have a ways to go. And so it\'s a primary focus for me and the organization and will drive velocity and efficiency.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.', 'David Mark Togut', 'A major regulatory change in payments just went through in Europe with Apple opening up its iOS and NFC chip for physical point-of-sale payments. What opportunity does this present to PayPal?', 'James Alexander Chriss', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, David. We are tracking this closely. Apple is a great partner of ours. And our customers that love PayPal on the online e-commerce side are demanding -- being able to have an omnichannel and off-line solution as well. So we'll be working closely on this. And when it is available, we will be ready to be able to deliver for our customers, both online and off-line."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.', 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', ""Alex, one more on the initiatives. I'm just trying to think through the prioritization of these additional investments you'll be making. Of those 6 initiatives, which do you think will sort of yield the returns quickest? And maybe a little bit more on timing of them, maybe not 2024, but how early? And then, Jamie, just a quick question on the interest rates. I think you mentioned, you don't expect it to have a big impact or as big an impact in 2024, but is there an explicit rate forecast you have? Like do you have lower rates in 2024?"", 'James Alexander Chriss', ""So all of the innovations are incredibly exciting for us, but let me be specific on your question. The two that I am closely watching and our teams are executing on immediately is really a focus on the branded experience. This is both for the combination of merchants and consumers, easing that experience for a customer to choose PayPal, have a reward that comes back to them, ensure that they're able to get through the experience with velocity and check out every time with PayPal, is a huge focus for us, and that's where we are driving a new app experience. And again, all of these innovations will be coming out over the next couple of weeks to months. Then we have to drive adoption. So that is having conversations with merchants, ensuring that they're upgrading to our latest innovations, that's ensuring that we make it easy for them as well. So that's why you've seen us launch a new developer portal. We're creating no-code, low-code experiences so developers can take the demand that they've shown because they have a best-in-class experience now and get it into market. So step one is I'm very focused on that branded experience. The second one is on the unbranded side, which is ensuring that Fastlane gets rolled out. That, to me, starts to create an interesting network effect of us being able to have not only a branded experience, but for them, those consumers that pass a branded experience, whether it's ours or anyone else's and want to just go through a guest checkout flow, we're able to identify them, we're able to help them and our merchants complete the transaction. And then we're able to have a follow-up conversation with that customer as well because they've gone through our Fastlane experience. So those 2 to me, we need to get rolled out, we need to get points on the board and show that it's driving, but driving outcomes, but that is where I'm most focused on right now."", 'Jamie S. Miller', ""Yes. And Sanjay, on the interest rate question, we do expect that the interest income on customer balances will have a strong growth this year, but really it will be more first half-focused. The second half, we do expect a series of rate cuts that is assumed in our macroeconomic scenario that underpins our guide, and that's why the second half should be much lighter on that front."", 'Operator', 'That is all the time we have for questions. I will turn it to Alex Chriss for closing remarks.', 'James Alexander Chriss', ""Fantastic. Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for joining us today. I want to reemphasize that 2024 is going to be a transition year focused on execution to position our business for long-term success. I'm excited with where we're positioned in the market, and I know that there is a real opportunity to grow our role in commerce. We're driving the foundational and transformative changes that will set the company up for the future. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.""]"

They bought in on innovations that many of them don’t quite understand or, perhaps, fully trust. However, for cybersecurity professionals, harnessing the potential of AI has been the vision for years–and a historic milestone will soon be reached: the ability to predict attacks.', 'The idea of predicting anything has always been the “holy grail” in cybersecurity, and one met, for good reason, with significant skepticism. Any claim about “predictive capabilities” has turned out to be either marketing hype or a premature aspiration. However, AI is now at an inflection point where access to more data, better-tuned models, and decades of experience have carved a more straightforward path toward achieving prediction at scale.', 'By now, you might think I’m a few seconds away from suggesting chatbots will morph into cyber oracles, but no, you can sigh in relief. Generative AI has not reached its peak with next-gen chatbots. They’re only the beginning, blazing a trail for foundation models and their reasoning ability to evaluate with high confidence the likelihood of a cyberattack, and how and when it will occur.', 'To grasp the advantage that foundation models can deliver to security teams in the near term, we must first understand the current state of AI in the field. Classical AI models are trained on specific data sets for specific use cases to drive specific outcomes with speed and precision, the key advantages of AI applications in cybersecurity. And to this day, these innovations, coupled with automation, continue to play a drastic role in managing threats and protecting users’ identity and data privacy. ', 'With classical AI, if a model was trained on Clop ransomware (a variant that has wreaked havoc on\xa0hundreds of organizations), it would be able to identify various signatures and subtleties inferring that this ransomware is in your environment and flag it with priority to the security team. And it would do it with exceptional speed and precision that surpasses manual analysis.', 'Today, the threat model has changed. The attack surface is expanding, adversaries are leaning on AI just as much as enterprises are, and security skills are still scarce. Classical AI cannot cover all bases on its own.', 'The recent boom of generative AI pushed Large Language Models (LLMs) to centerstage in the cybersecurity sector because of their ability to quickly fetch and summarize various forms of information for security analysts using natural language. These models deliver human-like interaction to security teams, making the digestion and analysis of complex, highly technical information significantly more accessible and much quicker.', 'We’re starting to see LLMs empower teams to make decisions faster and with greater accuracy. In some instances, actions that previously required weeks are now completed in days–and even hours.\xa0Again, speed and precision remain the critical characteristics of these recent innovations.\xa0Salient examples are breakthroughs introduced with\xa0IBM Watson Assistant,\xa0Microsoft Copilot,\xa0or\xa0Crowdstrike’s Charlotte AI\xa0chatbots.', 'In the security market, this is where innovation is right now: materializing the value of LLMs, mainly through chatbots positioned as artificial assistants to security analysts. We’ll see this innovation convert to adoption and drive material impact over the next 12 to 18 months.', 'Considering the industry talent shortage and rising volume of threats that security professionals face daily, they need all the helping hands they can get–and chatbots can act as a force multiplier there. Just consider that cybercriminals have been able\xa0to reduce the time required to execute a ransomware attack\xa0by 94%: \xa0they’re weaponizing time, making it essential for defenders to optimize their own time to the maximum extent possible.', 'However, cyber chatbots are just precursors to the impact that foundation models can have on cybersecurity.', ""The maturation of LLMs will allow us to harness the full potential of foundation models. Foundation models can be trained on multimodal data–not just text but image, audio, video, network data, behavior, and more. They can build on LLMs' simple language processing and significantly augment or supersede the current volume of parameters that AI is bound to. Combined with their self-supervised nature, they become innately intuitive and adaptable."", ""What does this mean? In our previous ransomware example, a foundation model wouldn't need to have ever seen Clop ransomware–or any ransomware for that matter–to pick up on anomalous, suspicious behavior. Foundation models are self-learning. They don't need to be trained for a specific scenario. Therefore, in this case, they'd be able to detect an elusive, never-before-seen threat. This ability will augment security analysts' productivity and accelerate their investigation and response. "", ""These capabilities are close to materializing. About a year ago, we began running a trial project at IBM, pioneering a foundation model for security to detect previously unseen threats, foresee them, and empower intuitive communication and reasoning across an enterprise's security stack without compromising data privacy. "", 'In a client trial, the model’s nascent capabilities predicted 55 attacks several days before the attacks even occurred. Of those 55 predictions, the analysts have evidence that 23 of those attempts took place as expected, while many of the other attempts were blocked before they hit the radar. Amongst others, this included multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attempts and phishing attacks intending to deploy different malware strains. Knowing adversaries’ intentions ahead of time and prepping for these attempts gave defenders a time surplus they don’t often.', 'The training data for this foundation model comes from several data sources that can interact with each other–from API feeds, intelligence feeds, and indicators of compromise to indicators of behavior and social platforms, etc. The foundation model allowed us to “see” adversaries’ intention to exploit known vulnerabilities in the client environment and their plans to exfiltrate data upon a successful compromise. Additionally, the model hypothesized over 300 new attack patterns, which is information organizations can use to harden their security posture.', 'The importance of the time surplus this knowledge gave defenders cannot be overstated. By knowing what specific attacks were coming, our security team could run mitigation actions to stop them from achieving impact (e.g., patching a vulnerability and correcting misconfigurations) and prepare its response for those manifesting into active threats.', ""While it would bring me no greater joy than to say foundation models will stop cyber threats and render the world cyber-secure, that's not necessarily the case. Predictions aren't prophecies–they are substantiated forecasts."", 'Sridhar Muppidi is an IBM fellow and CTO of IBM Security.', 'The markets are starting to realize\xa0just how hawkish the Fed is–and reckoning with higher-for-longer interest rates', 'The Biden administration’s\xa0freeze on LNG projects is a gift to Putin', 'WEF president:\xa0‘It’s time to revitalize trade—and reverse the trend of Slowbalization’', 'The anti-DEI movement has gone\xa0from fringe to mainstream.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks. Then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit?"", ""Udit Batra: Thank you, Caspar. And good morning, everyone. I would like to begin today's call by expressing my gratitude to all my colleagues. 2023 was another transformative year for Waters. Throughout the year, our teams kept an unwavering focus on customers, launched innovative new products, and delivered strong business performance, all during highly eventful times with dynamic market conditions. As 2022 ended, the results of our transformation clearly showed on the top line, having delivered several years of very strong, above-average sales growth. Since then, in 2023, we've demonstrated our ability to manage exceptionally well through a downturn while continuing to make investments for growth. In 2023, we also initiated the next phase of our transformation with the acquisition of Wyatt."", ""This brings with it a new vector for value creation to our shareholders through M&A and we're off to a great start. As an added benefit, it has accelerated our journey into high growth adjacent markets, where we made continued progress with our organic investments over the course of the year. We launched new and innovative products in 2023, including our Alliance iS next generation LC platform. We expanded our Xevo tQ mass spec into clinical applications and developed size exclusion columns for viral vectors that pair with Wyatt MALS instruments. We even had our first light scattering launch as a combined company with ZetaStar. Finally, we were recognized as one of the world's most sustainable companies, achieving a variety of ESG awards. This includes our top five ranking on Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list which scores over 1,000 publicly traded companies based on 230 ESG performance indicators."", ""We're very proud of what we've achieved at Waters in 2023. Today, as I share our fourth quarter and full-year results, I have three key messages. First, we've continued to execute well. Second, our transformation is contributing to our results. And third, we are well positioned for future long-term growth. Turning now to our results. In the fourth quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which was in line with our expectations. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share landed at the high end of our guidance at $3.62, driven by strong margin performance. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.65. For the full year, sales declined 0.5% as reported and 2% in organic constant currency. Even with a constrained CapEx environment, all our regions outside of China grew in 2023 in organic constant currency terms."", 'As expected, Wyatt successfully delivered on on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to sales. And with a strong EPS result in Q4, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in at $11.75, which reflects underlying growth of approximately 2% before FX headwinds of 3% and 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition. I will now describe our sales results in more detail. The spending environment for instruments remained challenging into year-end. However, Q4 revenue increase increased Versus Q3 levels in all our geographies, even China as we continue to execute well in tough macro conditions. Reported sales were $108 million higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. This reflects a 15% ramp that was consistent with our guidance for a muted year-end budget flush.', 'For the full year, our organic constant currency sales grew 3% year-over-year, excluding China. As I mentioned earlier, the Americas, Europe and Asia excluding China all grew in 2023. This took a lot of effort from our sales team who did a fantastic job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the market with our competitive portfolio. As a result, on a full-year stack basis, our ex-China growth remains at a healthy high-single-digits. A key challenge in 2023 was the abrupt turn we saw in China where conditions deteriorated as the year progressed. This was particularly the case in the pharma market where our revenues are most heavily weighted. For the full year, China sales declined more than 20% overall, which was a 5% headwind to our total growth.', 'This brings us now to our margin performance. We believe that the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management when things slow down. During 2023, we saw volume and FX headwinds, while inflationary pressure continued. We responded with stronger pricing and added further discipline to our operational objectives. We redoubled our productivity efforts, including the opening of our global capability center in Bangalore, India. And we undertook proactive cost alignment as the slowdown began to emerge. This resilience, focus and commitment allowed us to deliver excellent operational results in our P&L. Our full-year gross margin was 59.6%, which is 160 basis points better than the previous year. Our full-year adjusted operating margin was 30.9%, which is 70 basis points of expansion.', 'Now, let me share our progress with the acquisition of Wyatt Technology. The strong start to lead sharing between Wyatt and Waters allowed us to offset a slowdown in biotech spending, resulting in an on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to our full year sales. I will now give some detail on how our revitalized portfolio and alignment with higher growth segments are contributing to growth as part of our transformation. Our strong results in 2023 was supported by our innovative portfolio, which helped drive customer spending on new products are gaining good traction in the market, including TQ Absolute, Alliance iS and MaxPeak Premier Columns, as well as several of our high res mass spec instruments such as Cycliq G3 and MRT. From an adoption perspective, this puts us in an excellent position when instrument budgets begin to normalize.', 'Turning now to our adjacencies. We have continued to invest and expand into adjacent high growth markets, where our business model of solving problems in downstream regulated applications can be deployed. For bioseparations and bioanalytical characterizations, we made organic investments, launched new products, and deployed capital to M&A. Large molecule applications are now 35% of our pharma revenues and expected to trend higher, up from around 20%, just a few years ago. For diagnostics, we have invested in our clinical business and added workflows for specialty applications of mass spec. This has transformed related revenue growth from that of low to mid-single-digits to double digits in the past several years. Finally, our focus on batteries is paying dividends where very strong growth has remained throughout the year.', 'Revenues from battery applications are now at over 10 times 2019 revenue levels and our TA business is increasingly aligned with their cyclical faster growing applications. Each of these exciting growth areas is delivering incremental revenue to the company. Now I will share some facts supporting the long term outlook for above average growth and provide our 2024 guidance. Since 2010, Waters has grown on average 6% in organic constant currency terms. For instruments, while the standard deviation is high, long term average growth has been 5%. For recurring revenues, the standard deviation is much lower and the average growth is 7%. As we look ahead, several vectors make us confident that this growth could be even higher. The first is even faster volume growth in segments that we serve, driven by global prescription drug sales and environmental regulations.', ""Second is increased use of analytical instruments for characterizing large molecules and novel modalities. And third, it's about historic pricing where we expect to sustain 100 basis point long term tailwind in incremental growth. Let's take each of these growth vectors in turn. There are at least two key drivers of testing volume acceleration. The first is related to the adoption of GLP-1 drugs, where Waters' instruments and columns are specified into in-process testing and QA/QC testing at the two leading manufacturers. We expect our position to contribute an average additional revenue growth of 30 basis points per year between now and 2030. The second is PFAS testing where we've been gaining share in a rapidly expanding market, in part driven by the sensitivity and compact size of our Xevo tQ Absolute mass spec."", 'We expect PFAS testing to contribute an additional 30 basis points to our revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Finally, Wyatt light scattering is a high growth business, serving attractive large molecule applications. We expect it to contribute 40 basis points of core growth accretion to our business on an annualized basis. It also accelerates our ability to solve customer challenges at formulation development, bioanalytical characterization and QA/QC testing, which has positive repercussions for our Waters business as we increasingly tie our columns, LC and mass spec into these workflows. I will now cover our 2024 full-year guidance. We expect customer spending caution to continue in the first quarter of the year, with slow budget releases for downstream instrumentation.', 'We then expect to see a gradual improvement for the remainder of the year as budgets open up, market conditions improve and as prior-year comparisons become easier. We expect weakness in China to continue, particularly in the first half of the year, which also plays into the growth phasing of our guide. With this initial outlook for 2024, we expect full-year organic constant currency sales growth to be between negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. We expect continued strong operational performance to build leverage in our P&L with 20 to 30 basis points of further operating margin expansion, while still reinvesting for growth. And we expect adjusted EPS growth of 0% to 3%, in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. Now, I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our fourth quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance for 2024.', 'Amol?', ""Amol Chaubal : Thank you, Udit. And good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid close to a tough year in the fourth quarter with sales that were in line with our expectations despite continued market challenges. In the quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which aligned with our expectations for 15% increase in reported revenues versus Q3. Organic constant currency sales declined 8% against the high-single-digit growth comparison last year. We did observe a budget flush in the fourth quarter as sales grew across all geographies in Q4 versus Q3. However, this year's budget flush was more muted than typical, consistent with our expectations. Our Wyatt acquisition delivered excellent results again, adding over 3% growth to the reported sales."", 'In organic constant currency by end market, pharma declined 11%, industrial declined 4% and academic and government declined 9%. In pharma, our results were impacted by a further weakening in China, which declined 45% for the quarter. Outside of China, pharma sales declined 4% as instruments sales were impacted by a muted budget flush, in line with our expectations. In industrial, growth was flat outside of China against a tough high-teens prior-year comparison. China declined approximately 20% as weakness has broadened into non-pharma segments due to weak economic conditions. Overall, we observed continued strong growth in PFAS and battery-related applications, which have continued to partially offset weakness in more cyclical areas. In academic and government, our ex-China Business continued to perform well with mid-single-digit growth.', ""However, this was more than offset by a decline of almost 40% in China, where demand has deteriorated after the benefits of stimulus ended in the second quarter. By geography, sales in Asia fell 16% as China weakness more than offset mid-single-digit growth in the rest of Asia. The Americas declined 2% and Europe declined 6%, driven by this year's muted budget flush dynamics. By products and services, instruments declined 20%, recurring revenues grew mid-single-digits, with continued high-single-digit growth outside of China. There was one additional day in the quarter versus the prior year. Looking now at our full-year results, by end market, pharma declined 5%, industrial was flat, and academic and government grew 10%. Excluding China, pharma and industrial grew low-single-digits and A&G grew mid-teens for the year, each reflecting solid results against double-digit comps."", 'Now by geography, sales in Asia declined 7%, with China declining more than 20%, while Asia, ex-China, grew high-single-digits. The Americas grew 1% and Europe grew 2%. By products and services, instruments declined 10%, which was primarily driven by China. Excluding China, instruments declined low-single-digits in 2023, reflecting healthy high-single-digit four-year CAGR. Recurring revenues grew 6% overall and high-single-digits outside of China, with robust growth throughout the year. Chemistry growth has been supported by strong customer demand for MaxPeak Premier Columns, serving large molecule workflows, and adoption of ecommerce. For service, growth has been supported by expansion of plan attachment. In 2023, we exceeded our objective for a further 100 basis points of service plan attachment and delivered a 200 basis point increase for the year.', 'Now, I will comment on our fourth quarter and full-year non GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, in 2023, our team responded to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity, and proactive cost alignment, together with lower incentive compensation, allowed us to deliver a fourth quarter gross margin of 61.2%, an expansion of 170 basis points, and fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 34.9%, an expansion of 120 basis points. For the full year, our focus and effort resulted in gross margin of 59.6%, an expansion of 160 basis points, and an adjusted operating margin of 30.9%, an expansion of 70 basis points, which is after reinvesting in our high growth adjacencies.', ""Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.1%, 50 basis points below prior-year quarter. For the full year, it was 16.2%. Our average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 300,000 less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $3.62. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $3.65. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $11.75. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 3% and there was a 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $10.84. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation."", 'Now turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flows as cash from operation less capital expenditures and exclude special items. In the fourth quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $192 million after funding $42 million of capital expenditures. For the full year, free cash flow was $554 million after funding $161 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow were payments of $72 million related to tax reform, $26 million for Wyatt assumed liabilities, and $16 million related to investment in our Taunton Precision Chemistry operations. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This trend allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A, and returning capital to shareholders.', 'We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2 billion, a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2 times. This represents a decrease of approximately $150 million during the quarter as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt transaction. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objective. Now as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our high level thoughts for 2024. Similar to others in the industry, our growth in 2023 was slower than usual, driven by unprecedented weakness in China and cautious spending from customers in other regions.', 'We view these market conditions as temporary and anticipate a gradual recovery in sales growth throughout 2024. While our customers remain healthy, market uncertainty still remains and necessitates prudence in our guide. These dynamics support full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance of negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on full-year sales. We expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.3% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenues from inorganic sales incurred in the first four and half months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is approximately 0% to 2%. We expect to extend our strong margin performance into 2024 and deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023.', 'We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of additional operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full-year tax rate is expected to remain largely consistent with 2023 levels at 16.3%. Our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million. Now rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05, which is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Turning now to our expectations for the first quarter of 2024.', ""We believe that customer budget release timing will be slower than typical in the first quarter. In addition, current levels of market weakness in China are not fully reflected in last year's first quarter comparison. Last year's deterioration picked up significantly in the second quarter and thereafter. The first quarter also last year benefited from A&G stimulus in China. As a result, we expect our China business to decline approximately 40% year-over-year in Q1. Given these dynamics, we expect organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 11% to negative 9%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1%, while Wyatt is expected to add approximately 3.5% to sales for the quarter. Therefore, our total first quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 8.5% to negative 6.5%."", 'Based on these revenue expectations, first quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.05 to $2.15, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments.', ""Udit Batra : Thank you, Amol. So, in summary, another transformative year for Waters. We will continue to navigate the current market environment well and deliver earnings growth for our shareholders in 2024. Before I close, I would like to share a few updates on our ESG efforts. We've made strong progress towards our environmental goals with 77% of our electricity now sourced from renewable or low carbon sources. In 2023, we started working with the Science Based Targets initiative to build on this progress and develop further emissions reduction targets. We've also enhanced our climate related disclosure with our TCFD related reporting.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance.

It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year.

Whether or not this effect is real, investing in a company based on it is not a good idea. Investors would be better off focusing on the performance of stocks over the long run and not just during one month.', ""That said, let's look at two corporations that have what it takes to deliver solid returns to patient, long-term investors: CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP) and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG). Here's why these healthcare companies are worth buying this month -- or most months, for that matter -- and holding onto for a while."", ""Shares of CRISPR Therapeutics are up by 26% over the past three months (as of this writing). That coincides with the company's first regulatory approval, that of Casgevy, for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT). These two rare blood diseases are hard to treat, but Casgevy, developed in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is a one-time cure. Casgevy's approval in the U.S. and several other countries is a significant step forward for CRISPR Therapeutics."", ""The company can now brag that its gene-editing platform, arguably so far unproven, can lead to breakthrough therapies. And thanks to Casgevy's enormous potential, CRISPR Therapeutics should start to generate the funds necessary to advance its most promising programs. What is Casgevy's total addressable market? It's hard to come up with a definitive figure, but a lower bound of $70 billion seems fair. CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex plan to initially target 32,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe."", ""That total doesn't include some countries in the Middle East, where Casgevy is also seeking approval. At a price of $2.2 million in the U.S., that rounds up to $70.4 billion. The partners will also seek label expansions that would substantially expand their potential patient populations. Capturing this market -- or a portion thereof -- won't happen overnight, nor should investors expect CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex to grab 100% of it."", ""Gene-editing therapies take even longer to ramp up than everyday oral drugs since they are complex to administer. Still, things are looking good for CRISPR's future. The company is going after challenging targets, from several forms of cancer to type 1 diabetes and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (a rare, progressive disease that weakens patients' muscles). CRISPR Therapeutics should have strong sales of Casgevy within the next couple of years and record meaningful clinical progress."", ""CRISPR Therapeutics' market capitalization is currently $5 billion -- its growth story has just started. In my view, this company is well-positioned to become a leader in the biotech industry in time, which makes it an excellent stock to buy and hold."", ""Thanks to its da Vinci surgical system, Intuitive Surgical is the leader in the robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) market. Over the past few years, the company dealt with significant disruptions to its business caused by the pandemic. However, Intuitive still performed pretty well, and its financial results remain relatively strong. In the fourth quarter, Intuitive Surgical's revenue increased 17% year over year to $1.93 billion."", ""The number of procedures performed with its crown jewel jumped 21% compared to the year-ago period, while it ended the year with an installed base of 8,606 da Vinci systems, a 14% year-over-year increase. The company's adjusted earnings per share jumped 30% to $1.60. Those are strong results."", 'However, Intuitive Surgical is now facing an additional risk. The increasing popularity of diabetes and weight-loss medicines such as Ozempic and Zepbound could reduce demand for certain surgeries. The company is already seeing an impact. Management mentioned some deceleration in procedure growth due to these drugs in the fourth quarter.', ""However, that shouldn't matter a whole lot to long-term investors. For one, the bariatric (weight-loss) procedures whose demand is impacted by these medicines represent 4% to 5% of total global procedures. And Intuitive Surgical continues to gain market share in this area. Further, only 5% of procedures eligible to be performed robotically currently are, which means there is a massive runway for growth for other kinds of surgeries."", ""Intuitive Surgical also boasts a solid competitive advantage. Its da Vinci system costs between $0.7 million and $2.5 million. It also takes time to train physicians to use it. After making such a massive investment, hospital systems won't want to get rid of their da Vinci system, which grants Intuitive Surgical high switching costs."", 'That, together with its massive growth opportunities, should allow Intuitive Surgical to deliver outsized returns over the long run.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

By the end of 2023, valuations within the sector remained attractive, and positive shifts were observed in earnings estimates.

The sector shows a divergence, with large wireless and tower operators expected to de-lever, while some telecom and cable operators face competitive and secular challenges, along with increased debt costs. The sector is viewed as relatively resilient due to the essential nature of broadband and connectivity services. Despite potential risks like consumers opting for lower-priced services, wireless subscriber growth is anticipated, supported by implemented price increases. Fitch projects modest revenue growth and improved free cash flow for the sector in 2024-2025, with EBITDA margins expected to slightly improve. The decline in 5G-related capital expenditures is anticipated to drive an overall increase in aggregate free cash flow, allowing certain operators to focus on debt reduction in 2024."", ""According to PwC, the telecommunications industry is grappling with a strategic challenge akin to mature industries, facing increased data consumption but limited pricing power in commoditized services.

At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.', 'AT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time.

Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be allowed on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."", 'Michael Florin', ""Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer.

The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings releases for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments."", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""For the second quarter in succession, News Corp has achieved growth in both revenue and profitability. And we believe there are strong prospects for further growth as difficult, inauspicious macroeconomic conditions ease in some of our markets. We saw particularly robust results across the 3 core pillars of our company: Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services, where there was a resounding improvement in Australia in Q2. And there are early signs of recovery in the U.S. residential sector after the most sluggish market conditions in almost 3 decades. Given the potential of our world-leading brands, we remain intent on creating long-term value for investors. And as part of our commitment, our diligent, concerted review of the company's structure continues apace. Looking at the top line results. News Corp's second quarter revenues rose 3% to $2.6 billion, and profitability surged 16%, marking the third consecutive quarter of profit growth in testing economic times. Our net income for the quarter rose to $183 million from $94 million in the same quarter last year, while our reported EPS was $0.27 against $0.12 for the same period last year. The company's digital progress and prowess are increasingly evident. Halfway through fiscal 2024, digital now comprises approximately 52% of all revenues. That is more than an e-evolution. It is an e-revolution, one that has touched and transformed every element of every business, and we are far from satisfied, far from complacent, far from completion. We are seeing the collective benefit of our conscious strategic shift away from potentially volatile advertising revenues to growth in circulation and subscription revenues. In fiscal 2014, nearly half of News Corp revenues were from advertising, with 31% from circulation and subscriptions. There has been a fundamental metamorphosis. In the first half of the fiscal year, advertising had preceded to 16%, with circulation of subscriptions surging to 44%. Overall, News Corp as of Q2 had over 7 million subscriptions to our news brands, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, The Times and Sunday Times, The Australian and other publications. And we have an additional 4.3 million paid subscribers at Foxtel in Australia, which includes our popular streaming services Kayo and Binge. And those figures don't include the growing number of loyal subscribers at our professional information business at Dow Jones, where the average retention rate is comfortably above 90%. Artificial intelligence, with all its permutations and perturbations, will play an increasingly important role at most businesses. We expect to be a core content provider for generative AI companies who need the highest quality, timely content to ensure the relevance of their products. The [corny kilo] cliche is that AI companies are selling the picks and shovels during the seeming gold rush. Well, we are selectively reselling gold nuggets and those crucial negotiations are at an advanced stage. It is reassuring that certain digital companies appreciate the value of integrity, quality and creativity. And while certain other media companies prefer litigation, we prefer consultation as the former is merely creating a gold rush for lawyers. Courtship is preferable to courtrooms. We are wooing, not suing. But let's be clear, in my view, those who are repurposing our content without approval are stealing. They are undermining creativity. Counterfeiting is not creating, and the AI world is replete with content counterfeiters. I would like to compliment Sam Altman of OpenAI, who has shown a clear understanding of the social importance of journalism. He also appears to have emerged unscathed from his first visit to Davos, where there is always attitude at altitude. We are hopeful that, again, News Corp will be able to set meaningful global precedence with digital companies that will assist journalists and journalism and ensure that gen AI is not fueled by digital drops. We speak of the AI hallucinating, yet we, as a society, are hallucinating if we don't focus firmly on provenance at a time when even the very words misinformation and disinformation have themselves become sources of misinformation and disinformation. Too many media companies are scanning the landscape and presuming that they have a glimpse of the future and yet they cannot distinguish between trendiness and actual trends. Too many media companies, for too long, have been guilty of the Abilene Paradox. Before I turn to the results in detail, I must mention once again our colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who continues to be unjustly detained in a Moscow prison. He has been incarcerated for almost a year solely for being a highly professional journalist. We, at News Corp, and of course, Evan's family and many friends, hope that justice will prevail and that he will be released immediately. I would like to personally thank all those who publicly and not so publicly have been working diligently to secure his emancipation. Turning now to Dow Jones, which yet again achieved its highest level of quarterly revenues and profitability since News Corp's acquisition. That result is thanks to solid performance across the business, most notably in the increasingly successful professional information business, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to profitability at Dow Jones this fiscal year. The Professional Information Business is seeing robust growth due to the integration of Opus, which was completed ahead of schedule, and CMA, which is near complete. I would like to compliment, in particular, the News Corp Finance team for masterminding executing and delivering the Opus and Base Chemicals deals, which have been so critical to Dow Jones burgeoning growth. Executives at Dow Jones are far from smug and are building a bevy of new and compelling products. For example, Opus' Analytics Pro utilizes our database of more than 130,000 fuel stations to track visits and help customers assess their pricing strategies and market trends as well as compile customer loyalty rates and demographics, among other valuable, actionable data points. Meanwhile, Risk and Compliance's financial instruments product in partnership with BigTXN provides a fleet of R&C-sanctioned profiles mapped to commonly used financial instruments, which is crucial compliance cartography in a heavily regulated world. And DJ Integrity Check, our partnership with [Sapien], provides generative AI-driven insight into companies and relevant potentially problematic individuals. Subscriptions at the news business are continuing to grow. And during the month of January, average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones portfolio, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and Investor's Business Daily, reached over 4.9 million, which represents more than double the pre-COVID average level of 2.4 million digital subscriptions in Q2 fiscal '20. The acceleration of digital subscription growth has been driven in part by the team's bundling of products, which is designed to increase reader engagement and reduce long-term churn. While we have purposely shifted emphasis to recurring revenues at Dow Jones, we are happy to report that although we faced some challenges in print advertising, digital advertising grew year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This positive result has been driven primarily by growth in the tech and automotive sectors and most notably at wsj.com. Digital Real Estate Services had a strong quarter, thanks largely to the prospering of REA, where there was 22% revenue growth year-over-year, fueled by an 8% increase in listings with heightened activity in the core Melbourne and Sydney markets and higher pricing. REA India continues to expand rapidly and reported over 19 million monthly average unique visitors in December, solidifying its lead as the foremost digital housing platform in the world's most populous country, where strong economic growth and political stability have created a platform for further expansion. At Move, realtor.com, continued to be affected by the high U.S. interest rates that have undermined activity in the market. But mortgage rates are beginning to moderate. And in recent weeks, there have been early signs of an increase in all important leads. The National Association of Realtors announced that the index for pending home sales increased just over 8% in December versus the prior year, the largest increase since June 2020. realtor.com's latest housing report revealed that January marked the third consecutive month of year-over-year inventory growth, with a 2.8% increase in newly listed homes for sale compared to January 2023. Unique users at REALTOR have also stabilized, with December comScore data signaling a return to growth. During the downturn, the realtor.com team has been assiduously improving the user experience, broadening the portfolio of products for our customers and bolstering the back-end technology, so we are poised to take full advantage of the incipient recovery in the U.S. housing market. HarperCollins had stellar results for the second successive quarter. This was thanks to strength in both the front list and the back list, notably in the blossoming audio books category. We saw 15% digital revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by a 29% audio books sales increase due to a flourishing market and our new partnership with Spotify. Spotify appears to be expanding demand for audio books and opening the category up to new consumers. I would like to commend our thoughtful partner, Daniel Ek, for his commitment to creativity. In Q2, we saw success with bestsellers like The Pioneer Woman Cooks—, Dinner's Ready! by Ree Drummond; The Little Liar by Mitch Albom; Ann Patchett's Tom Lake; and Barbara Kingsolver's Demon Copperhead. We also saw strong sales for Christian books, including The Great Disappearance by Dr. David Jeremiah, who is rapture ready, and The Bible itself. Looking ahead to Q3, we have great expectations for, among others, A.J. Finn's End of Story and I Am More Than by LeBron James. At Subscription Video Services, our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbl, is expected to launch next month and improve the search experience for our cherished customers seeking entertainment and sports. We believe Hubbl will be the most effective conduit between consumer and content and add to the Foxtel success story. In a volatile world, Foxtel has achieved 8 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in constant currency, while being acutely and astutely cost conscious in managing the transition to streaming. At Kayo, we are looking forward to the upcoming winter sports season for Australian rules football and Rugby League, the 2 dominant sports. And at Binge, there has been early success with advertising at the basic tier while continuing ad-free service for premium customers. In News Media, our news brands have seen improvement in traffic in recent weeks, a turnaround after convulsions in the first half, where there were algorithmic aberrations. Gratifyingly, we experienced digital subscription growth during the quarter. Rebekah Brooks and her team at News U.K., have overseen continuing progress at The Times and Sunday Times, which set a new record for the quarter in digital subscriptions, at 575,000, and saw significant digital ad growth, up 21% on a reported basis and over 15% in local currency. We expect the success of The Times to continue beyond Britain's borders with the imminent digital launch of The Times in the U.S. We are confident that it will resonate with discerning readers hungry for objective news coverage in a market saturated with narrative non-journalism. At News Corp Australia, news.com.au was again the country's leading news web with nearly 13 million monthly uniques in December according to metrics from Ipsos. And The New York Post is again on course to be profitable and has expanded its positive political influence in these vexed and vexing times. With the strong results in Q2 and Q1, we are off to a sterling start in fiscal year 2024, which follows the 3 most profitable years for the new News Corp. We can sense that investors are beginning to appreciate keenly the value of our brands and the potential of our portfolio. On behalf of all our investors, we have transformed free cash flow generation, bolstered our balance sheet, initiated a dividend and are continuing our $1 billion buyback plan. For that transformative success, I would like to pay tribute to the strategic support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and to our highly engaged directors and to the commitment of our employees around the world. I am now pleased to turn to my talented colleague, Susan Panuccio, who will elaborate on these bouyant results."", 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, resulting in first half year-over-year improvements in both profitability and revenues. We continue to transform the company and move towards higher recurring and digital revenues, together with exercising strong capital allocation discipline and balancing reinvestment across the portfolio with ongoing fixed cost reductions. Our second quarter total revenues were $2.6 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year, an increase from the 1% growth delivered in the first quarter. Adjusted revenues grew 2% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $473 million for the quarter, up 16% compared to the prior year, driven by strong performances across our 3 key growth pillars: Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, which all posted double-digit profit gains. In fact, in the aggregate, those key segments delivered 24% profitability growth this quarter. Our second quarter total segment EBITDA was also the highest in 2 years adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 14% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.26 in the quarter compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were for $419 million, up 9%, a notable improvement from the first quarter rate and a return to revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of financial year 2022. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues rose 8%. Segment EBITDA rose an impressive 15% to $147 million due to a higher contribution from the REA Group, partially offset by revenue headwinds at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 16%. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 22% year-on-year on a reported basis to a quarterly record of $292 million with minimal impact from foreign exchange. Growth was again primarily driven by residential yield increases, improved growth in national listings favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. Overall, new buy listings rose approximately 8%, with Melbourne up 24% and Sydney up 22%. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence directly after hours for more details. Move's revenues of $127 million were down 13% compared to the prior year, with declines moderating from recent quarters. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 14%, driven by lower lead and transaction volume, reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 7% year-over-year with December improving to down just 2%, benefiting from a combination of easier comparisons as well as recent declines in mortgage rates. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat compared to the prior year, at 66 million. The U.S. housing environment remains tough, with existing home sales hitting 30-year lows, although we are hopeful the market will start to show improvement in the second half given recent declines in mortgage rates. That said, irrespective of any market considerations, we are determined to strengthen realtor.com's product and content offering so it's best positioned for success when the housing market moves. To that end, the realtor.com team is focused on executing several key strategic priorities, which include modernizing the technology platform to help with unifying the customer experience across all platforms; creating unique and scaled data for proprietary content to assist with increased personalization; leveraging News Corp's network in relation to AI initiatives and capturing audience share; and accelerating the diversification of revenues with a greater focus on the sell-side offering. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $470 million, up 2% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.3 million a quarter and flat with the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 2.8 million, increasing 4% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially due to seasonality at Kayo, tougher financial conditions caused by the inflationary environment for consumers and a weaker sports cycle. Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, dowant to 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was flat at 12.9% despite the final migration of cable in October. While broadcast ARPU rose 3% to approximately AUD 86, helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $77 million was down 14% versus the prior year, driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements and $10 million related to the upcoming launch of Hubbl, partially offset by higher revenues and lower technology and marketing costs. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. Moving on to Dow Jones. As Robert mentioned, the second quarter results delivered the highest quarterly revenue and segment EBITDA performance since the acquisition of Dow Jones over 15 years ago. Dow Jones delivered revenues of $584 million, up 4% year-over-year, which made Dow Jones the highest segment revenue contributor for the quarter for the first time since it was resegmented. Digital revenues accounted for 78% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented almost 76% of total revenues, up approximately 2 percentage points from the prior year, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We had very strong growth at PIB with revenues rising 13% year-over-year, including 16% growth at Risk and Compliance to $72 million and 15% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $62 million. Factiva again posted growth, benefiting from a new licensing deal. Total [pretension] rates remain very strong at over 90%. We are continuing to review our disclosures with the primary focus on increasing transparency to help the market appropriately value Dow Jones. To that end, we are now providing revenues for both Risk and Compliance and Dow Jones Energy in the 10-Q. Within the Dow Jones consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 15% year-over-year or by 135,000 sequentially, driven by an increased focus on the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlapping between products and drive greater engagement. Bundling accounted for over 70% of the incremental digital-only volume growth in quarter 2. Advertising revenues declined 4% to $126 million, relatively stable with the first quarter rate, although digital returned to year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the first quarter of financial year '23, rising 1%, driven by strength in the technology and auto categories. Print declined 11% due to weaknesses in financial services. Digital represented 62% of advertising revenues, up 59% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 17% to $163 million and was the largest segment EBITDA contributor with margins improving 320 basis points to 27.9%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. Cost declined about 1%, driven by head count reductions and lower newsprint production and distribution costs, in addition to phasing of sales and marketing miniature. At Book Publishing, financial performance, again, meaningfully exceeded our expectations, particularly in profitability. Revenues were $550 million, up 4%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $85 million compared to the prior year. Margins increased by almost 600 basis points to 15.5%. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key front-list titles, as Robert mentioned, and saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian publishing. Churn rates again improved materially due to better sell-through compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. Inflationary costs moderated with lower manufacturing costs, helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 60% of revenues, up from 57% last year, while digital sales rose 15% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio accounted for nearly 50% of digital sales, a record high, and we are pleased with the early positive signs from our partnership with Spotify, which generated incremental digital revenues and EBITDA this quarter. As way of background, Spotify is a usage-based model, not a pooled model. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 2% and segment EBITDA rose 65%. Turning to News Media. Performance in this segment was more challenged. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 5%. Advertising declined 9% and were down 11% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 5% and was up 2% in constant currency, benefiting from cover price increases. Advertising remained particularly challenged, with digital advertising trends again negatively impacted by the lower traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms. That said, as Robert noted, encouraging me, we are seeing some recovery in recent weeks, particularly at The Sun in the U.S. Segment EBITDA of $52 million, declined $7 million, which was due to the lower revenue, partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint and lower spend at talkTV. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 15%. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short term, albeit economic conditions vary across markets. Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January grew 12%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we hope to see continued improvements in lead volumes, with January up 1% year-over-year, given recent declines in borrowing costs, albeit off low prior year comparisons. As we mentioned last quarter, we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing and product development in the second half, increasing from depressed levels last year, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere. In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year, ongoing inflationary pressures, fewer new releases across entertainment due to the writers and actors' strike and a weaker summer sports schedule has created softness in streaming revenues, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. At Dow Jones, we expect strong revenue and profitability performance, underpinned by the transformation of our B2B offerings, and as mentioned previously, continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year. At Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends remain relatively stable, and we are encouraged by the strength in the downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year. At News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. Finally, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, we do expect some negative translation in the third quarter. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.', 'David Karnovsky', 'I guess the AI topic, Robert, you noted in the release you expect to be a core content provider for gen AI companies. Maybe you can speak a bit to current negotiations. What are the key sticking points key priorities for you or even the red lines for News Corp as you engage on this?', 'Robert J. Thomson', ""Yes, David, obviously, there's confidential negotiations, and so I can't go into too much detail. I mean it is fair to say that we've been leading the intellectual debate among media companies on AI. And it's also fair to say that we're probably leading the commercial discussions. I mean, 17 years ago, when prestige-craving media executives were sashaying with Silicon Valley, we were raising down stats about providence but also about the [valuable] impact on vulnerable young people of the smartest engineers on the planet creating compulsive-addictive experiences. Anyway, we're certainly not naive as well about the potentially positive and negative impacts of AI on our journalism, our creativity, our content. We've had almost 2 decades of distribution, dominating creation and almost 60%-or-so journalists have lost jobs in the U.S. And candidly, unfortunately, a certain percentage of that is down to journalistic pomposity and price consciousness, not audience consciousness and relevance consciousness. But AI is a hyper-effective form of -- or gen AI is a hyper-effective form of derivative distribution. It's retrospective, not prospective. And the thoughtful AI companies understand that fact. And so that's why on this occasion, I would like to highlight the thoughtfulness of Sam Altman. Thoughtful people do understand that counterfeiting is not creating. And crucially, in this exceedingly erratic era, we have deep facts, not deep fakes."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from [Anja Rakowski] from Evans & Partners.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Robert, maybe if I can pick up on the generative AI question as well. I appreciate there's only so much you can say, but how do you think about the potential payments which could come for the value of your content relative to what you're currently receiving from the digital platforms? Is it a similar sort of quantum? Could it be even a greater quantum over time, at least on a relative basis, I'd be interested in how you're thinking about it. And longer term, do you expect that those payments from the digital platforms will continue to come through?"", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""And so I'm sorry to be a basic, but I simply can't comment on the content and the negotiations. But I can't say they're at an advanced stage, and we are dealing with willing partners."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.', 'Kane Hannan', 'Maybe just on Dow Jones. I think the costs were down about $3 million in the quarter. Can you just talk a bit more about the [downtown] cost base, whether we can extrapolate that sort of performance going forward? And maybe as a follow-on to that, just the Professional Information Services within Dow Jones. I mean, obviously, extra disclosure. Did that business see margin expansion in the quarter? Or is the strong margin expansion, the Dow Jones overall, more of a mix and cost out in the other businesses?', 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""Hi, Kane, welcome back. Look, just in relation to the costs, we did see a pretty good cost performance for the first half at Dow Jones. And I think like all our businesses, they are pretty cost focused. So they do constantly have a look at transformation opportunities within the business, and they certainly participated in the 5% headcount reduction, and they're getting the benefit of that. But like all the businesses, we do like to invest in them. So we do see variable costs going up as the revenue scales. They have had inflationary costs in relation to headcount, and we'll continue to invest in headcount given the growth in that business. In the second half of the year, we would expect to see some phasing and additional costs coming through from marketing. We do tend to have seasonally higher net adds in the second half than we do in the first half. And so that typically warrants some additional marketing costs. So that's sort of in relation to the cost base. And then in relation to PIB, we don't give out the margins, as you know, but the PIB margins did improve for the quarter, which was really pleasing to see as they continue to scale that business. And as we said in our prepared remarks, for the full year, we're continuing to expect to see the majority of the profit come from the PIB segment."", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""Yes. And just to supplement Susan's answer, obviously, there was a priority for Dow Jones and for News Corp. And we are providing more visibility overall, Jones because it's such a positive story. And frankly, the more you see, the more you like. I mean overall, the margin at Dow Jones has risen from 24.7% a year ago to 27.9% and now that we're lapping the purchases of Opus and CMA, the strong growth rates are clear at these companies, which we have grouped into Dow Jones Energy, where revenues expanded by 15% and it is also, though, worth noting the result of the always burgeoning Risk and Compliance segment where revenues rose 16%. In short, these high-margin recurring businesses providing essential services and thus have renewal rates well north of 90%."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.', 'Craig Anthony Huber', ""Great. I wanted to ask, on the portfolio review and simplification announced that you mentioned 3 months ago and you briefly touched on it today. Can you just give us a further update. I'm just curious on the timing of this. I mean, I personally didn't expect a major announcement within just the first 3 months, but also the flip side, when it is expected to take another 6-plus months from this stage going forward? Do you just give us a little sense of the timing there? I mean, I assume you guys did an awful lot of work behind the scenes before you even talked about it 3 months ago in your conference call. You've certainly done some -- I'm sure some of these last 3 months. Just give us a little bit sense of the timing when we might get an announcement here, please?"", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""Craig, your presumption about preparation is not your conceived, but this being a rather sophisticated audience one which understands the nuances of phrases and the subtleties of the SEC. You can take the words I used in my statement as purposefully delivered. There is clearly much introspection, not casual, not peripheral. But significant serious introspection about structure, and it's functional, not emotional. And the prevailing truth is that we have created options for our shareholders, and that's a tribute to all at News Corp with the active support of enlighten Board and leadership from Rupert and Lachlan and the efforts of our employees around the world. Let us not forget that (inaudible) investment bankers were decidedly down beat at the time of the split a decade ago. And now, however, the discussion is how to get full value from, how to fully monetize a precious prestigious portfolio that has an obvious growth trajectory. That is indeed not an evolution, but a revolution."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.', 'Lucy Huang', ""Robert, Susan. My question is on PIB as well. Given we're kind of getting through the end of the [interaction of a person] CMA. Just wondering strategically how you're thinking about the growth in the business? And are there any other data sets that you would be looking to maybe build-out acquire over time? Like are there intentions or, I guess, capabilities you'll like to plug with PIB?"", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""Listen, obviously, we're pleased with the progress of the PIB business. And as I said, you can see the overall increase in margin at Dow Jones, and that is to a large extent due to the success of the big businesses. I can't get into any more details about what our plans are. But needless to say, PIB is core to Dow Jones and its quarter News Corp."", 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""And Lucy, what I say is that the thing that's great about PIB and the energy businesses is that the new products can leverage the existing data sets that we have, so the pricing, reporting analytics and newsletters and they can draw off a lot of the core data that we have. So I think that's fantastic. And I think Robert's mentioned in previous quarters, we've got areas like renewables that are coming in that we really think that could provide an exciting opportunity for us."", 'Michael Florin', 'Thank you, Lucy.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.', 'Brian Han', 'Susan, I noticed the second quarter PCP growth in books EBITDA is exactly the same as the first quarter PCP growth, both exactly, I think, 2/3 up on prior period. Is there some sort of a contracted step-up in earnings for books? Or is that just pure coincidence?', 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""I'd like to think they would be at that level, but no. No, I think it's just a coincidence. Look, we -- as we sort of said in the remarks, the Book Publishing segment has continued to exceed our expectations. And look, it's partly because we've had a return to more stability in the revenue post-COVID. So the returns have settled down and the market has settled down a little bit. And it's also partly because of the great work that the HarperCollins team has done in relation to their cost base. I mean in the face of some pretty challenging conditions last year, they also took the opportunity to push through some price rises on books. So a combination of all of that has really helped with putting the good results in for the first half. Look, I think across the full year, we're still expecting margins to be sort of in the low double digits, a good improvement from the prior year, but probably not to the levels that we've seen in the first half."", 'Michael Florin', 'Thank you, Brian. We will take our next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.', 'Darren Leung', 'I just wanted to ask a bit about the cost-out program. Can you give us a feel as to how much has been completed so far this fiscal year of the previous $160 million number. And just a feel for -- do you expect more of it to be [weighted] in third quarter or fourth quarter? Maybe another way to answer the question is what the [Dow Jones] should we expect to see a lot of this cost out come from, please?', 'Susan Lee Panuccio', ""Yes. Look, it's pleasing to say that actually, we quoted, I think, Dow Jones' number in relation to that cost-out program, and we are going to exceed that number. And actually, from a run rate perspective, we're pretty much there already. We have said in previous statements though, that's the gross cost savings, and we do have reinvestments across our businesses, as you can see within Dow Jones, within our REA, [Legacy News] with the Hubbl launch. And so that is the gross cost savings. What I would say is, notwithstanding that we are always looking at cost savings across our businesses. And so that was pertaining just to headcount reductions. We're constantly looking at our cost base and workflows and our efficiencies, and we do continue to drive great savings on that, which helps us reinvest in these businesses."", 'Robert J. Thomson', ""And Darren, I'd just like to supplement Susan's point, we are not going to let these excellent results in any way, induce complacency in the company. All the teams are extremely cost conscious. And we're already seeing very interesting trends in the ability of AI to risk costs related to technology spend to the creation of code to the cultivation of code. And so not only are we going to be pursuing our conventional costs, but we're looking ahead and trying to make the most of new developments."", 'Michael Florin', ""Thank you. Darren. We'll take our next question, please."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions). At this time, we have no further questions. I'll now hand over to Michael Florin for closing remarks."", 'Michael Florin', 'Well, thank you, Leila, and thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we will talk to you soon. Take care.']"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the communication industry, head over to 5 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\xa0', ""In 2023, the communication services sector experienced a remarkable year. The sector's success was partly a rebound from the previous year's lackluster performance and partly fueled by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Despite the strong showing in 2023, the communication services sector appears to have significant potential heading into 2024. By the end of 2023, valuations within the sector remained attractive, and positive shifts were observed in earnings estimates. Despite reaching record earnings and displaying momentum, stock prices in the sector had not yet returned to their previous peak levels."", ""Fitch Ratings' 2024 outlook for the North American Telecommunications and Cable sector remains neutral. The sector shows a divergence, with large wireless and tower operators expected to de-lever, while some telecom and cable operators face competitive and secular challenges, along with increased debt costs. The sector is viewed as relatively resilient due to the essential nature of broadband and connectivity services. Despite potential risks like consumers opting for lower-priced services, wireless subscriber growth is anticipated, supported by implemented price increases. Fitch projects modest revenue growth and improved free cash flow for the sector in 2024-2025, with EBITDA margins expected to slightly improve. The decline in 5G-related capital expenditures is anticipated to drive an overall increase in aggregate free cash flow, allowing certain operators to focus on debt reduction in 2024."", ""According to PwC, the telecommunications industry is grappling with a strategic challenge akin to mature industries, facing increased data consumption but limited pricing power in commoditized services. Despite a threefold increase in global data consumption by 2027, revenues from internet access are expected to grow modestly at a 4% CAGR to $921.6 billion. Telecommunications companies face significant investment needs, projected to spend $342.1 billion in 2027, particularly with the ongoing transition to 5G. PwC's Global Telecom Outlook suggests that, amid cost-cutting efforts, telcos can explore growth in areas like IoT solutions, private 5G networks, home broadband, and tailored digital services for sectors like entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing, and mobility. Adapting to broader ecosystems is seen as a strategic imperative in this evolving industry."", 'Some of the best communication stocks to invest in according to hedge funds include Meta Platforms, Inc.

At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.', 'AT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate.

So for stock pickers or people looking to stay, let's take some risk and move back into areas that either had done well a few years ago, it's been challenged and we're seeing that in earnings season.

Since the start of 2023, shares of Supermicro (as it is commonly known) have vaulted 709% while Nvidia stock has jumped 374%. Up until a recent surge by Supermicro, the two stocks have followed a similar path.', ""Both Nvidia and Super Micro Computer have been great stocks to own so far, but it's worth asking which is the better one to own today. To answer that question, we asked two of our contributors to pitch their pick of the two. First, we hear the Nvidia case."", ""Parkev Tatevosian (Nvidia): Arguably, no company benefits as much from the rising effectiveness of artificial intelligence as Nvidia. Revenue and profits are soaring for the maker of graphic processing units (GPUs). Unsurprisingly, the stock price has followed suit, but even though the market price has increased, Nvidia's valuation is still attractive for investors looking to capitalize on the AI wave."", ""Indeed, Nvidia's revenue jumped by 102% and 206% in its two most recent quarters from the respective quarters of the prior year. That can be primarily attributed to increased demand from enterprises and institutions looking to implement AI technology in their processes."", 'More importantly, the increase in sales has fueled a similar increase in profit for Nvidia. Operating income exploded to $6.8 billion and $10.4 billion in the two most recent quarters. Of course, a profit surge of this magnitude will attract competitors, but Nvidia is arguably at least one, perhaps two, steps ahead of its rivals.', 'To make the investment case more compelling, Nvidia is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 27, a relatively low price for a business with such excellent prospects. Investors can do worse than adding Nvidia stocks to their buying list.', 'Jeremy Bowman (Super Micro Computer): In many ways, Super Micro Computer is shaping up to be the next Nvidia. The company makes advanced servers and storage equipment that are well-suited to handle the kind of intense workloads that AI applications like ChatGPT demand. Supermicro works closely with Nvidia, and its hardware is built using Nvidia chips.', ""The relationship between the two stocks was reinforced again on Monday, when both stocks rose as Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Nvidia. While there wasn't a comment on Supermicro specifically, the analyst did note signs that AI server demand was strong and GPU supply was improving, which is good news for Supermicro."", ""Nvidia stock rose 5% on the news, but Supermicro jumped 14%. Those comments also indicate that Supermicro's business could be starting to experience the kind of breakout Nvidia saw last year. Improving GPU supply could also mean that Supermicro will beat its guidance for the year, as that was based in part on supply chain constraints."", ""Finally, Supermicro also has the advantage of being significantly smaller than Nvidia, meaning it's easier for the stock to be a multi-bagger from here. Nvidia currently trades at a market cap of $1.7 trillion, compared with $37 billion for Supermicro. It's not unreasonable for a $37 billion stock to double, but for Nvidia to double would mean it would become the most valuable company in the world. That's not an impossible task, but it's not as easy as going from $37 billion to $74 billion in size."", 'Both stocks look like great choices in the AI revolution, but Super Micro Computer has more long-term upside potential than Nvidia and looks like a good bet to surge later in the year as GPU supply loosens up and it can fulfill more demand.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Thanks for joining our call. McKesson reported a really solid fiscal third quarter, highlighting the continued momentum across the business. We delivered total revenues of $80.9 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $7.74, both of which grew by double digits when compared to the prior year. As a result of the recent performance and our latest outlook, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share from $26.80 to $27.40 to an updated range of $27.25 to $27.65.', ""This solid financial performance is driven by the focused execution against our company priorities. As a diversified healthcare services company, we are uniquely positioned to improve healthcare in every setting. This includes the areas of oncology and biopharma services. We continue to make significant progress in advancing our strategy and priorities, and I'm pleased to share some of the updates with you today. Let me start where I always like to start, and that's with our focus on people and culture. I start here because it's foundational to everything we do at McKesson."", ""In January, our board of directors welcomed Kevin Ozan as a new independent director. As the former chief financial officer of McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Ozan has over two decades of experience in both strategy and finance and will contribute a valuable perspective to our boardroom. We look forward to his leadership as we work together to deliver on our growth initiatives."", ""Driving the growth of our company requires a talented and diverse leadership team and, equally important, a diverse workforce where each individual is empowered to bring their own opinions, their own ideas, and perspectives. Our commitment to best talent and inclusion is reflected in every aspect of our operations. It's how we build a support network for our employees and how we each live these values through everyday interactions. And I'm pleased to see our efforts being recognized. For the 11th consecutive year, McKesson was named as a military-friendly employer. We were also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity and -- and Equality 100 Award winner by the Human Rights Campaign."", ""I'm proud of what we've achieved as a team and I'm truly grateful to the McKesson employees for upholding our culture, values, and delivering for all of our stakeholders, our patients, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, and importantly, each other. Moving on to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth. In the fiscal third quarter, we saw good performance in our distribution businesses. In U.S. pharmaceutical, adjusted operating profit grew 6%, reflecting broad-based momentum within the segment."", 'We continue to enhance our scale distribution network, improving efficiency through investments in automation and technology. Over the past year, we opened two new distribution centers in the U.S. that are equipped with innovative technology and employee-friendly design. These enhancements will enable our facilities to pick, pack, and ship medications to customers faster while simultaneously helping to optimize employee productivity levels by reducing redundant tasks. The investments in our foundation -- foundational distribution assets continue to support the growth of our business and the success of our customers. During the third quarter, we saw solid volume increases across customer channels, which includes distribution to retail national accounts customers.', 'At the consolidated level, prescription volume growth remains stable. Certain product categories, including specialty pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications, continue to grow at a faster pace and contribute as a tailwind to our revenue growth. As a reminder, we anticipate the growth from GLP-1 medications to slow in our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting the inflection in volumes for these medications in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In the medical-surgical segment, primary care visits showed modest improvement on a sequential basis after we observed general market modifications last quarter. The improvement was partially driven by overall increase in primary care visits.', ""However, when compared to the prior year, patient visit volumes in the medical segment remain a headwind to this quarter's performance. In the international segment, our Canadian business continues to perform well. It has a valuable portfolio of assets including pharmaceutical distribution, retail pharmacies, digital offerings. We're committed to strengthen and grow the business there. And as a part of that commitment, we're executing on a multiyear initiative that will modernize the distribution centers across Canada and deliver significant value to our employees and customers. Let me now continue on to talk about our oncology and biopharma platforms."", 'We continue to build on the foundation of our distribution capabilities, but we have strategically assembled a differentiated set of assets in oncology and biopharma services. Within the oncology business, The U.S. Oncology Network expanded its footprint by entering the state of Tennessee. Over the past quarter, we welcome two new practices, Nashville Oncology Associates and SCRI Oncology Partners, to the network. Through the combination of onboarding new practices and organic growth, The U.S.', 'Oncology Network has grown its provider base to over 2,500, spreading across nearly 600 sites in 30 states. The expansion of the network strengthened our unique market position in community-based oncology practices and demonstrates our strong value proposition to providers. Through The U.S. Oncology Network, we provide a range of comprehensive solutions to ease the administrative and operational burden and to help enable success -- the success of these community practices. In the past quarter, we started integrating new artificial intelligence capabilities into the network, assisting providers with revenue cycle management and evaluating clinical solutions.', ""With the help of AI and machine learning technologies, practices will be able to navigate complex insurance coverage and reimbursement processes more efficiently, allowing providers to spend more time focused on their patients. Within the biopharma services business, we continue to see strong market demand for our differentiated solutions that help improve access, affordability, and adherence to medications. In the third quarter of -- this fiscal third quarter, the prescription technology solutions segment delivered strong performance, primarily driven by the growth to access solutions, including prior authorization solutions for branded pharmaceuticals such as GLP-1 medications. Today, we provide -- provide prior authorization services for the vast majority of the GLP-1 medications in the market. Our integrated technology streamlines the prior authorization process and helps overcome medication access challenges that patients are facing. The main customers we -- customers we serve are biopharma companies, and through our scaled network connection, we can electronically process requests both at the pharmacy counter and the providers' offices. The prior authorization solution is an example of the power of our capabilities and is part of a broader portfolio of patient support services we provide."", ""We believe our solutions are highly differentiated and provide value to all stakeholders through a patient's journey. We're connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and approximately 900,000 providers. The scale of our network provides a strong foundation that enables us to reach key stakeholders effectively and seamlessly. The integrated solutions we offer can often be accessed through a single digital entry point. For our biopharma customers, the integration helps streamline workflows and increase transparency into how programs work together. In the past quarter, our teams have been working diligently to prepare for what we call the blizzard season."", ""For the prescription technology solutions segment, our fiscal fourth quarter is usually the busiest time of year due to customer annual verification activities. The annual reset of insurance policies typically drives a large influx of seasonal volumes for many of our programs. Each year, our teams come together to tackle the challenge of these significant volume increases. I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver another successful blizzard season that is in line with our expectations. Our products and solutions in both oncology and biopharma services provide significant value to our customers as reflected in the continued growth of these businesses. We're excited about the market opportunities in both areas, and we're confident in the scale and depth of our assets and expertise."", ""We will continue to invest and innovate to support the evolving needs of our customers and their patients. So, let me pull it all together. McKesson reported another solid quarter in fiscal 2024 that allowed us to raise and narrow our full-year guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share. We're committed to our shareholders to delivering long-term sustainable growth, and this quarter's results reflect the continued progress in delivering on our commitment. Health care is an ever-evolving market, but thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we never stopped finding new ways to drive positive impacts on our customers and their patients. I want to thank the over 50,000 McKesson employees who are working so tirelessly to advance our mission."", ""And with that, I'll hand it over to Britt for some additional insight and comments."", 'Britt Vitalone', ""Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our fiscal third-quarter 2024 results which reflect another quarter of solid momentum with growth across our North American businesses. Our results exceeded expectations, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. Before I turn to our consolidated results, we want to highlight one item that impacted our third-quarter GAAP-only results. We recorded an additional pre-tax gap provision for bad debts of $515 million, or $381 million after tax, within the U.S."", ""pharmaceutical segment. This provision is for uncollected trade accounts receivable from sales to Rite Aid in October of 2023 prior to its bankruptcy petition filing. We continue to provide distribution services to Rite Aid through an interim distribution agreement, providing the same efficiency and operational excellence as we have for over 20 years. We're closely monitoring developments. Rite Aid's bankruptcy will not have a material impact on our fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share results. The remainder of my comments will refer to our fiscal 2024 adjusted results."", ""Let me start with the review of the fiscal third quarter. McKesson delivered solid growth in the third quarter, led by sustained strong performance in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solutions segments. This year-over-year growth underscores operating execution across our diversified and differentiated portfolio, including investments in oncology and biopharma services. As a result of the third-quarter operating performance and our confidence in the business, we're increasing and narrowing our full-year outlook for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65."", ""Let me move to our consolidated results. Revenues increased 15% to 80.9 billion, led by continued strong utilization trends, growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical segment including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications, partially offset by lower revenues in the international segment resulting from fiscal 2023 divestitures within McKesson's European business. Excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures, revenues increased 16%."", 'Gross profit was $3.1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 3%. When excluding the impact of our European business operations, including completed divestitures and the impact from U.S. government COVID-19 programs in fiscal 2023, gross profit increased 10%. Operating expenses increased 4% in the quarter due to higher costs to support growth in the U.S.', 'pharmaceutical and prescription technology solutions segments. When excluding the impact of our European business operations including the completed divestitures, operating expenses increased 6% year over year. Third-quarter operating profit decreased 9% to $1.3 billion. Fiscal 2023 results included a pre-tax benefit of $126 million related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement, or TRA, with Change Healthcare. Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S.', 'government COVID-19 programs, which were mitigated by contributions from commercial COVID-19 distribution and a non-recurring $30 million charge in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment. These items were partially offset by growth in the U.S. pharmaceutical and prescription technology solutions segments. When adjusting for these items including 126 million, or $0.65 benefit from the early termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses associated with McKesson ventures equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024, operating profit increased 7% in the quarter.', 'Moving below the line, interest expense was $58 million, a decrease of 16% year over year, driven by effective management of our loan portfolio. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.6%, resulting from the recognition of a discrete tax benefit in the quarter. As a reminder, our effective tax rate can vary quarter to quarter, driven by our mix of income and the timing of discrete tax items. Third-quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 133.3 million, a decrease of 5% year over year. Consolidated third-quarter earnings per diluted share was $7.74, which represents an increase of 12% over the prior year.', 'This increase includes the impacts of approximately $0.63 related to the U.S. government COVID-19 programs and the $0.65 benefit from the termination of the TRA in fiscal 2023, an increased commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution, and a non-recurring charge in our U.S. pharmaceutical segment in fiscal 2024. Turning to our third-quarter segment results which can be found on Slides 7 through 11, and starting with the U.S.', 'pharmaceutical. During the quarter, we experienced volume increases across all product categories and customer channels. Specialty pharmaceuticals and GLP-1 medications continue to grow at a faster pace compared to the prior year. Third-quarter revenues were $73 billion, an increase of 18% year over year, driven by increased prescription volumes including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications. In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $2.8 billion, or 60%, compared to fiscal 2023. During the quarter, we also noted increased contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution.', 'In our fiscal third quarter, commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution peaked in October, then declined significantly in November and December. We do not anticipate material contributions from commercial COVID-19 vaccine distribution in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the third quarter, operating profit increased 6% to $828 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems. Adjusting for the impact of the U.S. government COVID-19 vaccine distribution in fiscal 2023, Commercial COVID-19 distribution in fiscal 2024, and the $30 million nonrecurring charge in the U.S.', 'pharmaceutical segment, delivered operating profit growth of 8% year over year. In our prescription technology solutions segment, the growth of GLP-1 medications and new brand launches led to increased demand for our access solutions such as prior authorization services. For the third quarter, revenues increased 7% year over year to $1.2 billion, and operating profit increased 25% to $193 million. Third-quarter results reflect increased prescription transaction volumes which drove higher demand for our access solutions, principally prior authorization services and growth in our third-party logistics business.', ""In addition to the strength of prior authorization services, year-over-year growth was also supported by increased sales to new customers and programs across our access and affordability solutions. Turning to medical surgical solutions, revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2%, primarily driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses, partially offset by anticipated lower contributions in the kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, primary care patient visits moderately increased on a sequential basis. Demand for commercialized COVID-19 vaccine distribution across the alternate sites of care that we serve was also modestly higher compared to prior expectations. The overall illness season dynamics, including vaccinations and testing, continue to be an operating profit headwind in the quarter when compared to the prior year. As a reminder, each illness season is unique depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year."", ""Operating profit was $282 million, a decrease of 16% driven by anticipated lower contributions from the kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program and a softer illness season as compared to fiscal 2023. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items from the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment delivered operating profit growth of 7% driven by growth in the primary care and extended care businesses. Next, let me address our international results. Revenues in the third quarter were $3.6 billion, a decrease of 18% year over year, driven by divestitures within McKesson's European business, partially offset by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in Canada."", ""Operating profit was $105 million, a decrease of 27% driven by divestitures within the McKesson's European business. Wrapping up our segment review, corporate expenses were $147 million in the quarter, which included losses of $8 million, or $0.05 per share, related to equity investments within the McKesson Ventures portfolio. McKesson Ventures' impact on consolidated financials can be influenced by the performance of each individual investment quarter to quarter. As a result, McKesson's investments may result in gains or losses, the timing and magnitude of which can vary for each investment. We remain pleased with the insights and the results that we're obtaining through this portfolio. Excluding the benefit from the early termination of the tax receivable agreement in fiscal 2023 and gains and losses within our McKesson Ventures portfolio in fiscal 2023 and 2024, corporate expenses in the third quarter decreased 5% year over year. Turning now to cash flows and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12."", 'We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We delivered free cash flow of $100 million in the third quarter and $2.9 billion for the trailing 12 months. Third-quarter free cash flow was impacted by the Rite Aid bankruptcy in October and its associated $725 million provision for bad debts. As a reminder, our cash position, working capital metrics, and resulting cash flows can each be impacted by timing, which includes the day of the week that a quarter ends on, and, therefore, can vary from quarter to quarter. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we made capital expenditure investments of $418 million, which included new and existing distribution centers as well as investments in technology, data, and analytics to support our growth priorities. Year to date, we returned $2.6 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $2.3 billion of share repurchases and $232 million in dividend payments.', 'Now, let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. The following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. A full list of our assumptions can be found on Slides 13 through 17 in our supplemental slide presentation. Let me start with the fiscal 2024 outlook for our segments.', 'For the full year, we now anticipate U.S. pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16 to 18% and operating profit increased 6 to 8% year over year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the U.S. government in fiscal 2023, we anticipate operating profit to increase 11 to 14%. The impact of elevated commercial COVID-19 distribution in the third quarter, net of the $30 million nonrecurring charge also in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, accounts for approximately 2% of segment growth. The updated segment revenue outlook incorporates the strong third-quarter performance and continued growth in specialty distribution supported by stable utilization trends.', 'Revenue growth assumes that GLP-1 medication volumes will continue to be robust, although the rate of growth will moderate in our fiscal fourth quarter. These medications are lower margin and represent a headwind to year-over-year operating profit growth. Our full-year operating profit growth also reflects our leading generics program, which continues to deliver on the dual mandate of lower cost and product availability. And we continue to be pleased with the strength of our scaled and broad oncology platform. This quarter, as Brian mentioned, we expanded into Tennessee with the addition of two practices. With these additions and organic growth, U.S.', ""oncology is now over 2,500 providers. In the prescription technology solutions segment, we anticipate revenue growth of 9 to 13%, and we've increased our operating profit growth outlook to 24 to 28%, reflecting strong third-quarter performance, continued organic growth, and higher transaction volumes across our access and affordability solutions. A quarter-to-quarter variability in this segment is driven by prescription and transaction volumes; the timing, pace, and trajectory of new product drug launches; the timing and size of investments to support and expand our product portfolio; and the annual verification programs that we provide for our customers that occur in our fiscal fourth quarter. The medical-surgical solutions segment continues to be a leader across all the alternate sites of care. We anticipate revenues to be approximately flat to 4% growth and operating profit to decrease 11 to 15%. When excluding the impact of COVID-19-related items from fiscal 2023 results, we anticipate operating profit to increase 6 to 8% year over year. Our updated outlook incorporates the third-quarter results that I discussed earlier, which reflect a modest improvement in sequential primary care traffic."", ""Finally, in the international segment, we anticipate revenues to decline by 29 to 33% and operating profit to decline by 21 to 26%, reflecting divestitures within McKesson's European business that closed during fiscal 2023. In the corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $615 million to $655 million, which includes losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments recorded in the first nine months of the year and elevated technology spend to support the growth of our business. Moving below the line, we anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $230 million and income attributable to noncontrolling interests to be in the range of $155 million to $165 million. We anticipate no change to the full-year effective tax rate of approximately 18 to 19%. The timing of discrete tax item is difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning to cash flow and capital deployment, we now anticipate free cash flow of approximately $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion."", 'Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter to quarter impacted by timing, including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our outlook also incorporates the impact of the -- of the October Rite Aid bankruptcy. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $3 billion to $3.5 billion of shares. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 134 million. Wrapping up fiscal 2024 guidance.', 'As a result of solid performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, combined with our momentum and confidence moving forward, we are increasing and narrowing our earnings per diluted share outlook for fiscal 2024 to a new range of $27.25 to $27.65. We anticipate operating profit will be a 2% decline to 1% growth compared to the prior year. Excluding certain items, we anticipate operating profit to increase by approximately 8 to 11% year over year, above the long-term target range. As a reminder, certain items include the following: $1.90 related to fiscal 2023 U.S. government COVID-19 programs and COVID-19 tests in our U.S.', ""pharmaceutical and medical-surgical segments; a $0.65 benefit related to the early termination of the tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare in fiscal 2023; and gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments in fiscal 2023 and 2024. The increase to our outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share indicates growth of 16 to 18% when excluding these certain items. Before I close, I'd like to share some initial thoughts on fiscal 2025. The momentum we've seen across our business over the past several years is expected to continue in fiscal 2025. We anticipate the U.S."", ""pharmaceutical and medical-surgical solutions segments will be more closely aligned to long-term growth targets that we've previously provided for these segments, demonstrating our leading market positions and stable financial performance. We anticipate that the strength we're seeing across our solution set and prescription technology solutions will lead to growth at the top end or slightly above the long-term target. In U.S. pharmaceutical, we remain confident in our long-term target of 5 to 7% growth supported by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and across our oncology platform, The U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada, and the joint venture with Sarah Canyon Research Institute."", 'As the leader in the alternate site market, we believe that the medical-surgical solution segment is well positioned as care continues to move across the alternate site settings. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture this growth opportunity in the years ahead. We anticipate that the prescription technology solutions segment may perform modestly above the long-term growth target of 11 to 12% driven by organic growth as we expand our higher-margin biopharma services platform. For the international segment, we anticipate continued growth in our Canadian operations. And throughout fiscal 2023, we completed divestitures of the business operations in 11 of the 12 countries that we operated in Europe. As a reminder, Norway remains the only country that we have not entered into an agreement to sell, and we intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit.', 'Finally, we will continue to materially invest in a business on multiple fronts. We will sustain the pace and cadence of investment in product development and enhancements across our oncology and biopharma services platforms. These investments will further our differentiated capabilities and market-leading positions. We will also continue to invest in adding capacity and capabilities to our North American distribution footprint. These investments include increased capacity, automation, and regulatory excellence capabilities. We will continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence.', ""We see AI as unlocking the potential to deliver customer and foundational enhancements. Although in the early stages, we're using AI to improve patient intake and workflow; improve productivity throughout -- throughout the system including automatic clinical note generation; and several supply chain use cases including supply -- supply chain disruption predictions, forecast accuracy algorithms, and fraud detection. Although we're in the early stages of our AI development and implementation, we're committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership positions and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders. To sum up, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business. We're pleased with our strong fiscal 2024 performance, and we remain optimistic about the outlook. McKesson is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results as we successfully execute against our strategic and financial framework to drive long-term sustainable growth for all stakeholders."", ""And with that, let's move to our Q&A session."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'Charles Rhyee', ""Yeah, thanks -- thanks for taking the questions. You know, obviously, a strong performance in -- in Rx TS as implied in the guidance. Maybe you can kind of give us a feel for the mix between reauthorization versus new prior auths in that mix. And -- and as we think about through the course of the year as kind of new category, like you know, this is sort of a category that's kind of grown significantly over the last year or so particularly, and if we think about the launch of Zepbound as well from Lilly, can you give us a sense of what the life cycle typically is for prior auths? You know, over time, as products mature, what does that activity looks like? And -- and maybe give us a sense for what you kind of expect right now, you know, particularly in the GLP-1 category?"", 'Brian Tyler', ""Thanks, Charles. I'll -- I'll start. And, Britt, as always, feel free to add on. First off, we're very pleased with the solutions that we have in this segment."", 'We think the growth over the last several quarters demonstrates the value that they bring to providers. Just as a reminder, this -- this segment, new brand launches of particularly high-cost drugs, our drivers for this segment, they typically require prior authorization. We have automated solutions there. So, that -- those volumes grow.', ""That's generally good for good for this business. The GLP-1s were a strong contributor in the current quarter. You know, how the programs evolve will largely be dependent on payer decisions in terms of how frequently they require an authorization or a reauthorization. But certainly, it's been a good tailwind for us."", ""And as to the blizzard season, I'm pleased to say we -- it played out in accordance to how we expected it to. It's a lot of work. The team really put their head down, had a good plan, and pushing through that work. And we're very confident we'll end this blizzard season more or less in line with our expectations at the outset of the year."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.', 'Eric Percher', ""Thank you. I appreciate the '25 initial commentary, and I wanted to focus in --on specialty. I thought coming out of the pandemic, we saw elevated growth, and you're calling out higher growth this year. And I'd like to understand how much of that is organic growth versus gaining of share and beyond oncology increase of share in multi-specialty."", ""And then, finally, I'd ask, for those practices you're acquiring now, I assume you've known them for quite some time. What is it that's driving them to join today?"", 'Brian Tyler', ""Let me start. I guess I'll start where you ended with -- with the practices. First thing I think I would say is, you know, we've -- we're very pleased with the solid growth in our same store. We can obviously grow our U.S."", ""Oncology Network in multiple ways. We can add -- we could add oncologists or providers to an existing practice that we have. We could greenfield a new practice. We could onboard new practices that really we've been benefiting over the last few years from -- from all three of those."", ""We have been very pleased with our ability to attract new members to The U.S. Oncology Network. We've added, I don't know, 500 or 600 providers over the -- over the last couple of years. We've entered into six new -- we added six new practices and eight new geographies over the calendar year of 2023."", ""You know, why are we able to do that? You know, we think it's not just great practice management. And, you know, we've been at this for 15 years. So, we've got a leading EMR. We've got leading technologies."", ""Britt talked about investments we're making to -- to extend that lead. But I think we also have this broad ecosystem that includes Ontada, which helps us provide insights to our providers. It includes SCRI, which brings in clinical research and trial capabilities. And so, we think it's that really broad value proposition, Eric, which allows us to -- to compel the growth we're seeing in The U.S. Oncology Network today."", 'Britt Vitalone', ""And, Eric, maybe I'll just add on, you know, when we think about specialty product growth, we're certainly seeing specialty product growth across not only our largest customers but across the mentioned health systems. And certainly, as we continue to grow The U.S. Oncology Network and oncology in general, and we're certainly seeing more growth in that area as well. So, we're seeing growth in specialty products. We're seeing growth across the specialty providers that we service."", ""And as I mentioned, we're also seeing significant growth from GLP-1 medication. So, we're really winning across the entirety of our scaled business. And of course, as our customers continue to win, that's reflected in the volume increases also."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'Lisa Gill', ""Great. Thanks and good afternoon. I just want to go to your international business. And you talked about how strong Canada is, but there's been some speculation in the marketplace around Rexall."", 'Can you talk about the strategy in Canada and specific to -- to owning a drug retail?', 'Brian Tyler', ""Well, I won't -- I won't comment obviously on -- on rumors, you know. Let me say this about Canada, we have a very scaled, broad, and impactful healthcare services business there. It's obviously anchored in our distribution assets, but it includes specialty distribution capabilities. It includes retail pharmacies."", ""It includes, you know, one of the best online brands and Well.ca.

So, we're very very broad in our capabilities and -- and really one of the leading players in -- in -- in the Canadian healthcare landscape in general. We've been very pleased with the performance of the business. Britt talked about some of the investments we continue to make into that business to keep -- to keep our growth trajectory going."", ""And I'd say we just -- you know, we're very pleased with the performance and very committed to the current strategy."", 'Britt Vitalone', 'The only thing I would add is, similar to our U.S. business, in Canada, we have very strong strategic sourcing capabilities as well, which our customers benefit from and is helping our customers win and helping us drive increased distribution volume. So, very similar to -- to the U.S. We, you know, we utilize our strong scaled strategic sourcing capabilities to help our customers win.', 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Allen Lutz -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Britt, you mentioned core operating expense growth was about 6% excluding divestitures. As we think about the current growth across your different businesses, is that 6% growth rate the right way to think about operating expense growth from here? And then, is there any reason why that would take higher or lower versus that 6%? Thanks.', 'Britt Vitalone', ""Thanks for the question, Allen. I think when you -- when you look at our operating expenses, what we try to do and what we've been able to do over a long period of time is gain leverage on our gross -- gross profit. And so, what we strive to do, what we demonstrate is that, you know, our operating expenses typically will grow at a slower pace than gross profit. Now, we've been investing back in the business. And so, as we've been investing not only in distribution capabilities, data and analytics, and now, an accelerated investment in artificial intelligence, you know, a quarter -- a quarterly variability in that operating expense number, you can expect to see that. But generally speaking, you will see us generate operating leverage on our gross margin."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead.', 'Brian Tanquilut -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Hey, good afternoon, guys. Maybe, Britt, just curious what you're seeing on the generic pricing front and, you know, what opportunities we should be thinking about as we think about, you know, combination of drug shortages and just broader inflation trends in generic?"", 'Britt Vitalone', 'Yeah, thanks for the question, Brian. In generics, we continue to have a very scaled sourcing operation in ClarusONE. ClarusONE continues to partner very closely with our broad set of customers, is generating good sourcing benefits. I talked about the dual mandate that we focus on, which is driving low-cost capability.', ""You know, low-cost positions for our customers, at the same time, is driving the highest availability of supply. We've been able to do that over a long period of time. Our generics business continues to -- to grow, and we're quite pleased with the -- the sourcing spread that we're able to generate from our sourcing buy-side capabilities. And we think that our customers are benefiting as well, and we see that in high compliance rates. So, it's been a competitive but stable marketplace in the generic space."", 'But the capabilities that we have on sourcing, the ability for us to drive lower cost and high availability of product, and generate spread for our customers in a disciplined way, that has proven to be a good formula for us over a long period of time.', 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead.', 'Kevin Caliendo -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the color on the Rite Aid impact. I'm guessing my -- my question is, I know we don't know exactly what's going to happen with the rest of Rite Aid."", ""We should hopefully know soon. But what are the assumptions built in for fiscal '25 around the potential impact from whatever happens with Rite Aid from here, like, is -- is it built in -- in your comments? And how meaningful can it be?"", 'Britt Vitalone', ""I appreciate the question. And I, you know, obviously can't -- I am not in a position to comment a lot on Rite Aid. What I can tell you is what we've talked about for fiscal 2024 and Rite Aid is not going to have a material impact on our financial results, so I would leave it at that. In terms of 2025, you know, we -- we'll learn more over the next few months."", ""We'll give you more information as we give you further information on all of our fiscal 2025 assumptions. But Rite Aid is not material to our financial results in fiscal 2024."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead.', 'Eric Coldwell -- Baird -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good afternoon. This one, I think, is fairly obvious and fairly simple, but I just want to make sure. The free cash flow reduction versus prior guide, is that specifically and only due to the Rite Aid impact? And if so, I guess the question is why you didn't take that last quarter, perhaps, when -- I guess maybe that's not a fair question given the timing, but I just want to make sure that's -- that's the only topic there. And then, on the -- on the repo activity as well, slightly lower outlook here, 3 billion to 3.5 billion versus prior 3.5 billion."", 'Is that also the Rite Aid impact or perhaps due to valuation in the market or some other topic? Those are my only two. Thank you very much.', 'Britt Vitalone', ""Yeah, I appreciate the question, Eric. And you'll note that in our free cash flow guide for the rest of the year, the reduction versus the prior guidance that we gave you is not the full impact of -- of the Rite Aid provision for bad debt. So, it is a key driver to that. So, to answer your question very simply, yes, Rite Aid and the bankruptcy is a driver on the free cash flow reduction."", ""In terms of share repo, I'd say that there's two things that are driving that. Clearly, we are taking a look at our free cash flow guide. But, you know, going back to our principles of how we deploy capital, one of the things that we've talked about is, A, we will buy back shares when cash -- there's excess cash on hand that we can't deploy in a growth format; and secondly, we're going to be looking at the intrinsic value of the stock. We want to be in the market and we want to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, but those two factors are going to be important to us."", ""And so, we're going to continue to be disciplined, and so a portion of that is reflected in the lower share buyback."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'Stephanie Davis -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I was -- I know you've given a lot of great color on this, but that's hoping we could dig a little bit more into the strong U.S. pharmaceutical growth and how to think about the lighter flow through the margin. Is there anything beyond GLP-1s kind of doing that? And you made a comment on commercial COVID net of 30 million nonrecurring, accounting for some of the growth that we saw."", 'Could you clarify kind of any impact that would have on the margin flow-through?', 'Britt Vitalone', ""Yeah. So, let me make comment on a couple of things. We're really pleased with our U.S. pharmaceutical results."", 'They delivered another strong quarter. Included in that, you know, obviously, we are lapping the effects of the -- of the government program of COVID last year. This year, we do have commercial COVID vaccines that peaked in October and then really fell off. And we did have a one-time nonrecurring charge in the quarter. And when you net the -- the commercial COVID vaccine contribution in that charge, it roughly offsets the government program contribution from last year.', ""So, the performance within the -- within the segment is just strong, continued utilization that we're seeing in the marketplace, continued strong growth of specialty across all of our customer channels, and the continued growth in our oncology business, as well as -- as I mentioned -- I provided a number on the revenue impact from GLP-1, which again, come at a lower margin rate and have been a headwind to year over year. So, to just sort of sum up, it's just continued strong utilization in the marketplace in general, continued good growth of our customers and channels, and continued growth within our oncology business."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Erin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks. So, as I think about 2025, you know, why is 5% to 7% still the right growth target to target for U.S. pharma just given the specialty contributions and growth there and favorable generics environment? And just do you think kind of the long-term growth has inflected higher at this point for longer? Or, you know, what are some of those offsets that we should be thinking about in 2025? Thanks.', 'Britt Vitalone', ""Appreciate the question. Let me just start by stating that at the beginning of the year we gave guidance, the long-term growth rate for the segment was 4% to 6%. Given the performance that we've seen this year, we increased that target -- that long-term target rate to 5% to 7%. What I'm trying to provide you now is an early view into some of the qualitative factors that we're looking at and some of the momentum that we see going forward, and indicating that -- that that long-term range that we increase this year, we still see that as being the right number today. Now, we'll continue to do some analysis and work, and we come forward with our full-year assumptions."", ""We'll give you more insight into that. But just as a reminder, we've already increased the long-term target range this year from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7%. And we're certainly pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the segment."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.', 'Daniel Grosslight -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Thanks for taking the question. One of your competitors mentioned that there may be an ability to renegotiate GLP-1 contracts as they come due to potentially extract a bit more margin for the drug supply chain. I was wondering if you could comment on -- on your views of contract negotiations as those contracts renew, and if there may be an ability to boost the margin profile of GLP-1 going forward.', 'Brian Tyler', ""Well, I would say this, I think we've talked many times in these calls that the first most important thing for us to do is make sure we get fair value for the services that we provide. And then, obviously, we want to provide as many services as we can in support of those products. And that philosophy is no different for the GLP-1 class than it is, frankly, for all of the -- of the products that we distribute. So, you know, we are always in close contact and communication with our -- with our biopharma partners to talk about the value that we deliver, to talk about maybe the ancillary services that we could offer in support of those programs, and to find ways that we can both support the growth of our respective businesses. And that's exactly the lens we'll bring to this product class, and it's really no different than the way we run the business day to day."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'OK, next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.', 'Elizabeth Anderson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. You guys talked about continuing to invest in some of the longer-term drivers of the pharma growth in terms of oncology, biopharma services, etc. I was hoping you could unpack that a little bit more and sort of talk a bit more about where you sort of see the most attractive opportunities versus the assets that you already have.', 'Thanks.', 'Brian Tyler', ""Sure. I'll start and Britt can -- can tack on. First thing I would say is, you know, I'm -- I'm really pleased, over the last several years, we have been very disciplined in making sure that we made organic investment or reinvestment back into the business. And, you know, we view that as part of good portfolio management. I mean, our goal is to continue to extend the -- the growth that we see in our markets and to innovate -- innovating new solutions as part of that."", ""So, you know, now when we allocate that investment capital, certainly, some goes into the core where we think we can get efficiency, better services, extend our base value proposition, but a lot will go into what we call our growth pillars, and that would be oncology. So, in one instance, we've talked a lot is about, you know, greenfielding our oncology business or our data and analytics business. Obviously, we've gone inorganic with SCRI and extend it into clinical trials and research. But a quarter or two ago, about some innovations that we've made in our Rx TS segment and enhancing some of our solutions and -- and, frankly, building and innovating and bringing new solutions. So, it's much like our inorganic investment, we – we -- we are tied to our strategy and --and committed the business cases that we think will deliver more return."", ""I think the one area that we probably highlighted more this quarter than we have in the past is investments in technology, AI, machine learning. Obviously, that -- the developments and advancements in that field have come on fast. And when you think about a business that operates at our kind of scale, we're very excited about the opportunities we see there. And when you think about like a U.S. oncology, Britt highlighted several places where we think we can use this kind of technology to make a better patient experience, make our -- our provider experience better, and to continue to drive efficiencies through that business. So, we will continue to be committed to investing back in the business where we see good financial returns tied to our strategy."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'OK, next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.', 'George Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Britt, first, which is kind of a point of clarification, when you say GLP-1 as an EBIT headwind, you mean to margins not to dollars? And then, for Brian, I have a follow-up question on -- on oncology. I guess, could you just kind of talk about the greenfield opportunity that remains in the USO business. And do you think more about the opportunity to add providers, kind of add regions or add services into the installed base, as kind of the way to continue to grow that business? Thank you.', 'Brian Tyler', ""I'll start with your second question and then Britt can add on. So, I talked about three ways to -- to drive the U.S. oncology business. You know, one is to acquire a practice in a geography we're not, obviously, to add providers to an existing geography."", 'And in instances where, you know, our criteria are met, meaning we think we can attract the right level scale, we can find oncologists that want to practice consistent with the way the way we practice oncology in -- in our network, we -- we are not afraid to greenfield. Obviously, adding to an existing is faster, acquiring an established practice that we feel fits our criteria is probably second, and greenfield would be third, but -- but we have all those avenues open to us. And so, you know, we look at the criteria, the population, the growth, the payer mix. These all kind of go into our formula as we identify which of those three avenues is the most viable.', 'Britt Vitalone', ""And the answer to your first question is we've talked about GLP-1s previously, and today, we are talking about margin rate. They usually come at a lower margin rate than other products that we distribute. And as I mentioned, they have been an operating profit headwind year over year."", 'Rachel Rodriguez', 'And we have time for one more question, please.', 'Operator', 'Certainly. That question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Unknown speaker -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Hi, this is Carol on Steve. Just to follow up on the prescription technology segment of GLP-1, now that we're starting to come up against some harder comps, just how should we think about growth for this business tied to new versus renewed prescriptions? And what are some of the other categories we should be focused on as growth drivers outside of GLP-one? Thank you."", 'Brian Tyler', ""Well, I think, as, you know, we think about GLP-1s, obviously, you know, four quarters ago is a big growth quarter. We're going to start to lap that. I think my characterization is there will continue to be growth. That growth may or may not be linear depending on product launches, uptake, you know, how commercial government and other payers adopt policies to -- to manage these products. So, I think it's going to be growth, it's going to be slowed compared to what it has been historically, and it's probably going to be a little bit longer than, you know, we would typically expect just because of the size of the class."", 'Britt Vitalone', 'And I would just remind you that, well, the growth has been robust, and we do expect the rate of growth to moderate as we go to future quarters beginning in the fourth quarter. We did increase the guide for the operating profit for the segment. So, the momentum in that segment is really good, prior authorizations in general, GLP-1 specifically, but also seeing good growth across other access and affordability solutions within the segment.', 'Brian Tyler', 'Well, thank you again, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate, as always, the great questions. I want to thank you, Cynthia, for facilitating the call. And maybe just a concluding comment.', ""McKesson continues to make really meaningful progress in advancing our strategy and our mission.

GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with FOXA.', ""On February 7, 2024, Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) filed its 10-Q report, providing a snapshot of its financial performance and strategic positioning. This SWOT analysis delves into the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, informed by the latest financial data. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, Fox Corp reported revenues of $4,234 million, a decrease from the $4,605 million reported in the same period the previous year. Operating expenses saw a slight reduction to $3,393 million from $3,528 million. Net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $109 million, down from $313 million, reflecting a decrease in earnings per share from $0.58 to $0.23. These figures indicate a challenging quarter for Fox Corp, with a notable decline in profitability."", ""Brand Power and Market Position: Fox Corp's brand strength, particularly in news and sports broadcasting, remains a formidable asset. The company's portfolio, including Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, and sports channels FS1 and FS2, commands significant audience loyalty and advertiser interest. Fox News continues to be a ratings powerhouse, often leading in viewership among cable news networks. The strategic bet on live sports and news has paid off, with live events driving consistent viewership and commanding premium advertising rates. The company's owned and operated local television stations further solidify its market presence, providing a direct connection to local audiences and advertisers."", ""Content and Rights Portfolio: Fox Corp's content strategy, emphasizing live sports and news, differentiates it from competitors who are more reliant on scripted content. The company's rights to broadcast major sports events, including NFL games and college sports through the Big Ten Network, provide a competitive edge. These live events are less susceptible to the shifts in consumer viewing habits that have impacted other forms of programming. Additionally, the Fox Studios lot offers strategic advantages in content production and ancillary revenue generation."", ""Digital Initiatives and Acquisitions: Fox Corp's digital expansion, exemplified by the growth of Tubi, its AVOD service, showcases the company's commitment to evolving with industry trends. Tubi's growth reflects a successful foray into the streaming space, offering a complementary platform to Fox's traditional broadcast and cable operations. The acquisition of Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm, also indicates Fox's willingness to diversify and innovate beyond its core media business."", 'Adaptation to Industry Shifts: Despite its strong brand and content offerings, Fox Corp faces challenges in adapting to the rapid shifts in the media landscape. The decline in traditional cable subscribers and the rise of streaming platforms necessitate a strategic response to retain and grow audiences. While Tubi represents a step in the right direction, Fox Corp must continue to invest in and promote its digital offerings to compete effectively with streaming giants.', ""High-Profile Legal Disputes: Fox Corp has been embroiled in high-profile legal disputes, including those related to allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at FOX News and defamation claims. These issues not only pose financial risks due to potential settlements and legal fees but also threaten the company's reputation and brand integrity. The settlement of the Dominion Voting Systems defamation lawsuit for approximately $800 million in April 2023 underscores the financial and reputational risks associated with such disputes."", ""Financial Performance: The recent decline in net income and earnings per share, as reported in the latest 10-Q filing, points to financial weaknesses that need to be addressed. The decrease in profitability may raise concerns among investors and could impact the company's ability to invest in growth initiatives. Managing costs and identifying new revenue streams will be crucial for improving financial health."", ""Digital and International Expansion: Fox Corp has the opportunity to further expand its digital footprint, both domestically and internationally. Tubi's growth can be accelerated by increasing investment in original content and expanding its availability in new markets. Additionally, leveraging Fox's strong brand, the company can explore international opportunities for its news and sports content, potentially opening up new revenue streams."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: Fox Corp can continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships that complement its core businesses. The launch of the United Football League (UFL) in January 2024, through a joint venture with XFL, exemplifies this approach. Such initiatives can diversify Fox's content offerings and create new avenues for audience engagement and monetization."", 'Technological Innovation: Investing in technology to enhance content delivery and advertising capabilities can provide Fox Corp with a competitive advantage. Innovations in targeted advertising, streaming quality, and user experience can attract and retain viewers, particularly in the increasingly crowded streaming market.', 'Competitive Landscape: The media industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for audience attention and advertising dollars. Fox Corp must contend with traditional broadcasters, cable networks, and streaming services, all of which are investing heavily in content and technology. Staying ahead in this competitive environment requires continuous innovation and strategic investment.', ""Changing Consumer Preferences: Consumer preferences are shifting rapidly, with a growing preference for on-demand and ad-free viewing experiences. Fox Corp's reliance on live sports and news, while currently a strength, may be challenged by these changing preferences. The company must remain attuned to audience trends and adapt its offerings accordingly."", 'Economic and Regulatory Risks: Macroeconomic factors, such as recessions or shifts in advertising spending, can adversely affect', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Across the U.S. trucking industry, more than 1 billion of these appointments are made each year, commonly through phone calls and emails.', 'With touchless appointments, the entire process is automated and can be done 24/7 with no manual intervention.

Statutory earnings per share fell badly short of expectations, coming in at US$5.15, some 74% below analyst forecasts, although revenues were okay, approximately in line with analyst estimates at US$34b. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Cummins ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus, from the 16 analysts covering Cummins, is for revenues of US$33.0b in 2024. This implies a discernible 3.0% reduction in Cummins' revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to surge 260% to US$18.68. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$33.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$19.65 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year."", ""The consensus price target held steady at US$263, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Cummins at US$304 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$231. Even so, with a relatively close grouping of estimates, it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations, suggesting Cummins is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that revenue is expected to reverse, with a forecast 3.0% annualised decline to the end of 2024. That is a notable change from historical growth of 7.8% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 3.1% per year. It's pretty clear that Cummins' revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry."", 'The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$263, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.', 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.', 'More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statements in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today’s webcast presentation, are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.', ""Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of 2023 and discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and then I'll finish with the discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. As I reflect back on 2023, I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on being a global leader in clean energy technology and innovation. We made significant progress in achieving our Destination Zero strategy and it continues to be clear that this dual path approach to reducing greenhouse gas and air quality impacts of our products is the right approach to meet our customers' needs today and continue to grow our business and impact."", ""We did this by advancing our core business as well as developing new zero emission solutions through Accelera by Cummins. Most notably, for our core business in 2023, we committed to investing more than $1 billion across our US engine manufacturing network to support the industry's first fuel-agnostic engine and platforms, as well as unveiled the X10 fuel-agnostic series launching in North America in 2026. Additionally, we initiated several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine, which will launch in North America this year and further enables our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. This is the industry's first natural gas engine design specifically for heavy duty and on-highway truck applications, offering customers the opportunity to realize reductions in nitrous oxide and greenhouse gas without compromising performance."", 'We are continuing to see strong interest from both OEMs and end users ahead of the launch later this year. In our Accelera business, we announced a joint venture with Daimler Trucks and Buses, PACCAR, and EVE Energy to accelerate and localize battery self-production and the battery supply chain in the US. We further announced this quarter the selection of Marshall County, Mississippi for the 21-gigawatt-hour factory that is expected to create more than 2,000 US manufacturing jobs with production anticipated to begin in 2027. Accelera also reached a further milestone this year of electrolyzer order backlog, totalling over $500 million. In order to meet the growing electrolyzer demand, we began production at our first US manufacturing location for electrolyzers in the Cummins Power Generation Facility in Fridley, Minnesota.', 'Lastly, we are resolute about the leading role we play in the energy transition, and emissions compliance continues to be a critical element of this work and central to our values. We were transparent about this in December when we announced that we reached an agreement and principle to resolve US regulatory claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines, primarily used in our pickup truck applications. After 4.5 years of working diligently with the regulators, reaching an agreement was the best way for us to achieve certainty on this matter and move forward with certifying our new products and advancing our Destination Zero strategy. We have expanded and strengthened our emissions compliance program to help ensure our products comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations around the world.', 'Our product compliance and regulatory affairs organization, which we launched in 2019, has a reporting line directly to me and positions come as to meet global product compliance requirements and deliver solutions for our customers that are safe and lead to a cleaner environment. Now I will comment on overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for this quarter totalled $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% compared to 2022, driven by strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% compared to positive $1.1 billion or 14.2% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2023 results included $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to a voluntary retirement and separation program, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business.', 'This compares to the fourth quarter 2022 results, which included $19 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5%. EBITDA dollars increased from a year ago as increased pricing and higher volumes more than offset increased selling, administrative research and development expenses and inflation costs. Research and development expense increased in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the engine, components and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was very strong at $1.5 billion compared to $817 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on working capital management within the business.', '2023 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, 21% higher than 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was $3 billion or 8.9% of sales compared to $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales in 2022. 2023 results include $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, the voluntary headcount reduction program I noted previously, and $100 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to our 2022 results, which included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and $81 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023 compared to $4 billion or 14.2% of sales for 2022, as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling, administrative, research and development and inflation costs.', ""EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in the distribution, components and power systems segments. Our Power Systems business in particular finished 2023 with a full year EBITDA of 14.7% of sales, up from 12.2% in 2022. This segment completed the first year of their focused business transformation effort, and the improvement in performance is encouraging. You will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. In addition to our segments, Meritor finished 2023 with full year EBITDA of 10.8% of sales, up from 7.4% in 2022, as our employees did a tremendous job of executing value capture opportunities across the business. I'm very pleased with the performance of Cummins Meritor to date as we continue our program to improve margins in that business and expand its global reach."", ""In addition, operating cash flow for 2023 was a record of $4 billion, a significant increase from $2 billion in 2022. I'm proud of our leaders and employees efforts in 2023 as they helped deliver on one of our primary focus areas. Strong cash generation will continue to be a top priority moving forward. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2024 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2024 guidance continues to include Atmus for the full year, but excludes any costs or benefits associated with the planned separation of that business. We are forecasting total company revenue for 2024 to be down 2% to 5% compared to 2023, and EBITDA to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales, as we anticipate slowing demand in some of our key regions and markets, particularly North America heavy duty truck."", 'Early in 2024, we expect the heavy duty market to continue at its current rate, which is slightly off the peak of the first half of 2023, with further softening in our forecast in the second half of the year. Industry production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2024, a 10% to 15% decline year-over-year. In medium duty truck market, we expect market size to be 140,000 units to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat compared to 2023. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 units to 145,000 units in 2024, a 5% to 10% decline year-over-year as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024.', ""We're projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy duty and medium duty truck demand, and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in light duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and moderating export demand. Despite this slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we expect to see continued strong performance for the 15 liter natural gas engine as we achieved approximately 20% share for 2023 in the heavy duty market. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect a 5% to 15% decline year over year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China."", 'We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. Revenues in the global power generation market are expected to increase 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, while the small market for us, demand for oil and gas engines, is expected to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. And for aftermarket, we expect a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2024, as we expect to be largely through inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $450 million to $500 million, compared to the $354 million in 2023.', 'We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to deliver over the course of the next 12 months to 18 months, as well as expect continued growth in electrified components. In summary, 2023 was a record year for revenues and operating cash flow, excluding the impacts related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims. 2023 was also a record year for EBITDA, net income, and earnings per share. While 2023 revenues were at the high end of our expectations, we anticipate moderating demand in North America truck production in the second half of 2024. We expect this moderating demand to be partially offset by a strong power generation market, resiliency in our distribution business, given the strong aftermarket presence, and improved Accelera sales.', 'In addition, we are taking steps to reduce costs, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. As I close, I would like to officially announce that our Analyst Day is now scheduled for May 16 in New York City. I look forward to further discussing our strategy and expect invitations to be sent out shortly. Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark?', 'Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. I will acknowledge I have a heavy cold this morning. So if I sound more dour than usual and a little rougher, please take that into consideration. We delivered solid operational results in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations for revenue and delivering EBITDA margins in line with our guidance. Compared to 2022, our full year sales grew 21% and our operating cash flow more than doubled to a record $4 billion, reflecting the strong focus of our employees on meeting customer demand and improving working capital. Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion and EBITDA was a net loss of $878 million, or negative 10.3% of sales.', 'For the full year, we reported revenues of a record $34.1 billion and EBITDA was $3 billion, or 8.9% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we recorded a one-time charge of $2.04 billion in Q4 to settle the previously disclosed US regulatory claims. Fourth quarter results also included $42 million of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus were $33 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million for the full year, compares to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a total of $81 million in the previous year. Full year 2022 results also included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2023 full year operational performance of our business, I am now excluding the costs associated with the regulatory settlement, voluntary retirement separation programs, planned separation of Atmus and the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments.', ""Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 8%, driven by improved pricing across multiple end markets and stronger demand for power generation products. International revenues increased 13%, driven by strong global power gen demand, particularly for data centers. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales for the quarter, compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5% of sales a year ago. Improved pricing was offset by higher compensation costs, increased investment and development, and capabilities in our Accelera segment. Higher variable compensation costs were driven primarily by stronger operating cash flow, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the full year. Now I'll go into each line item with a little bit more detail."", 'Gross margin was $2 billion or 23.7% of sales, an increase of $201 million or 30 basis points from the prior year. The improved margins were driven by favourable pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher product coverage costs and compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $154 million or 15% as we continue to invest in the development of new products that will drive future growth and also due to higher variable compensation costs. Joint venture income increased $25 million due to slowly recovering demand in China from a low base in 2022. Other income was $50 million, an increase of $17 million from a year ago, primarily due to the recovery of technology fees from customers in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $92 million, an increase of $5 million from the prior year driven by higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt.', 'The all in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was negative 13.3%, principally due to non-deductible costs associated with the regulatory settlement. All in net loss for the quarter was $1.4 billion or negative $10.01 per diluted share, which includes $2.04 billion or $13.76 per diluted share of costs associated with the regulatory settlement, $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million or $0.17 per diluted share of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.5 billion, $642 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven by strong earnings and a lower expansion of our working capital across the business.', 'For the full year 2023, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, up 21% or $6 billion from a year ago, driven by the inclusion of a full year of Meritor results and strong organic growth. Sales in North America increased 22% and international sales increased 20%. Within those numbers, organic sales growth was 12%, driven by improved pricing, strong global demand for power generation products, continued strength in the North American truck market, and slowly improving economic conditions in China. EBITDA for the year was $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023, an increase of $1.2 billion or 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase in EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes, favourable pricing and logistics costs, and a modest and favourable mark-to-market impact from investments that underpin our company-owned life insurance plans, all of that partially offset by higher compensation expenses.', 'All in-net earnings were $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share, compared to $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share a year ago. 2023 net earnings include $2.04 billion or $13.78 per diluted share of costs related to the regulatory settlement, $100 million or $0.54 per diluted share of costs related to the separation of Atmus, and $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs related to the voluntary separation programs that we implemented during the fourth quarter. Full-year cash from operations was a record inflow of $4 billion, doubling from a year ago as a result of higher operating income and much lower expansion of working capital across the company. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $1.2 billion, in line with our forecast, and an increase of $297 million from 2022, as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the fuel agnostic platforms within our core business.', ""Our long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders, and over the past five years we've returned 56% of operating cash flow in the form of share purchases and dividends. In 2023, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments and dividend growth, returning $921 million to shareholders via the dividend, and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor. We currently expect that our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will mirror those of last year. I'll now summarise the 2023 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2024. If I need to say it again, I will, that the results that I'm going to discuss going forward exclude the costs related to the separation of Atmus, the cost associated with the voluntary retirement and separation, and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in 2022."", 'Component segment revenues were a record $13.4 billion, 38% higher than the prior year. EBITDA was 14.4% of sales compared to 14.2%, an increase of $540 million, or 40%. For 2024, we expect total revenue for the components business to decrease 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.9%. For the Engine segment, 2023 revenues increased 7% to a record $11.7 billion and EBITDA was 14.1% of sales, compared to 14.3% a year ago. In dollar terms, EBITDA increased $74 million or 5%. In 2024, we project revenues for the engine business will decrease 2% to 7% due to expected moderation in the North American heavy-duty truck market, most likely in the second half, or most prominently in the second half of the year. 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%.', 'In the distribution segment revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $10.2 billion and EBITDA increased by 28% and improved as a percent of sales to 11.8% compared to 10.6% a year ago. We expect distribution revenues to be between down 3% and up 2% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.4% to 12.4% for the full year. In the power system segment, revenues were also a record at $5.7 billion or 13% higher than last year. EBITDA was 14.7% or 250 basis points higher than 2022 driven by favourable pricing, strong volume and certain cost reduction actions. In 2024 we expect Power Systems revenues to be down 3% to up 2% and EBITDA in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. Accelera revenues increased $354 million in 2023 with a net loss at the EBITDA level of $443 million.', 'In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues and now we anticipate that Accelera revcenue will increase in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to reduce to between $400 million and $430 million as we continue to make targeted investments in future technologies, whilst improving the operating performance of our current products. We currently project 2024 company revenues to be down 2% to 5% and company EBITDA margins in the range of 14.4% to 15.4%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024 excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will likely be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth. To summarize, we delivered record sales and strong operating profits in 2023.', 'Cash generation has been and will continue to be a strong focus as we enter 2024, enabling us to continue investing in new products even during times of economic uncertainty, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Jen indicated, we do expect moderation in several of our key markets in 2024, especially in the US truck market as reflected in our guidance. We have already taken actions to reduce costs in the business and are in a good situation to navigate the economic cycle and improve our cycle over cycle performance in 2024. Subject to our mark-to-market conditions, our intention is to split the remaining ownership in Atmus through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation as we seek to reposition our portfolio for the future.', ""As part of the proposed exchange offer, common shareholders will have the choice to exchange all, some or none of their shares of Cummins' stock for shares of Atmus common stock subject to the terms of the offer. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as in the coming days. Our guidance for Cummins for this year assumes the inclusion of Atmus in our consolidated results for the entirety of 2024 and excludes any costs or benefits of the separation. The benefits to Cummins are expected to include a lower number of shares outstanding upon completion of the exchange. We will update our guidance as and when the separation is completed."", 'Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.', ""Chris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question."", 'Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.

Discovery were teaming up to create a joint venture that will marry the three companies' sports-heavy channels into a new streaming service. While key details, like pricing, are still unknown, increased competition is profoundly bad news for fuboTV."", ""The problem for fuboTV is simple: Its business model just doesn't work, even without much direct competition. Some sports can be found on various streaming services, including Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and Disney's ESPN+, but there's nothing as comprehensive as fuboTV's platform."", ""The company has had little trouble attracting subscribers, and price hikes haven't been a problem, given that there isn't a viable streaming alternative for many subscribers. At the end of the third quarter, fuboTV had 1.48 million paid subscribers in North America, with each generating $83.51 of revenue each month, on average, through subscription fees and advertising. The company bumped up subscription pricing in January, tacking on $5 to each of its plans."", 'Even with a lack of competition, fuboTV continues to light cash on fire. In the third quarter, the company reported free cash flow of negative $29.5 million. That represents an improvement but puts the company on pace to burn through about $120 million annually. To put that in perspective, this is a company that now has a market capitalization below $600 million.', ""The game fuboTV has been playing for years to keep the lights on -- selling additional shares of its stock to fund operations -- becomes more difficult to pull off as the share price sinks. In the first nine months of 2023, the company raised $117 million through stock sales. That's on top of the $292 million it raised in 2022 and the $140 million it raised in 2021. The company had $260 million in cash at the end of the third quarter, which won't last long as cash flies out the door."", ""Because fuboTV's content costs are generally tied to the number of subscribers on its platform, costs rise right along with revenue as the subscriber count grows. Since fuboTV's distribution agreements sometimes feature minimum guaranteed payments, costs wouldn't necessarily decrease if the company were to start losing subscribers."", 'Even before the joint venture news, raising cash to keep things going was going to be tricky for fuboTV. Shares of fuboTV are down 97% from their pandemic-era high. The amount of cash the company could realistically raise from selling additional stock without crashing the stock price further is likely limited.', 'When the new sports streaming service from the trio of traditional media companies goes live later this year, fuboTV may find subscriber growth much harder to come by, especially if pricing for the new service is significantly lower than what fuboTV charges. Subscribers will also have the option to bundle with existing streaming services from the three companies.', ""The company's plan to produce positive cash flow in 2025 depends on continued subscriber count growth. If this new service stunts the company's growth, fuboTV will run out of cash and be forced to raise more. With limited resources, securing expensive sports rights in competition with deep-pocketed rivals may prove impossible."", ""fuboTV has shown that there's a sizable market for sports-centric streaming services and subscribers are willing to pay cable-like monthly fees.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', '-US$1.48b', '-US$1.59b', '-US$154.0m', 'US$389.0m', 'US$604.3m', 'US$842.7m', 'US$1.08b', 'US$1.30b', 'US$1.50b', 'US$1.67b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 55.36%', 'Est @ 39.44%', 'Est @ 28.29%', 'Est @ 20.49%', 'Est @ 15.03%', 'Est @ 11.21%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.0% ', '-US$1.4k', '-US$1.4k', '-US$129', 'US$308', 'US$452', 'US$594', 'US$719', 'US$817', 'US$887', 'US$930', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.8b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Exelon as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.807. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Operating income is expected to reach somewhere between $287 million and $297 million.', '“Despite a mixed retail environment during the holiday season, our third-quarter revenue results were in line with our expectations; we were able to deliver better-than-anticipated profitability and remain on track to achieve our full-year outlook,” said Linnartz. “As we close out fiscal 2024 and our strengthened leadership team begins to come up to speed in the quarters ahead, we are working to reset Under Armour toward a path of improved revenue growth and enhanced value creation in the future.”', 'Wholesale revenue decreased 13 percent in the period to $712 million, and direct-to-consumer revenue increased 4 percent to $741 million due to a 5 percent increase in owned and operated store revenue and a 2 percent increase in e-commerce sales, which represented 45 percent of the total DTC business in the quarter.', 'The company continues to struggle in North America, however, where sales fell 12 percent to $915 million, but international revenue increased 7 percent to $566 million because of a 7 percent jump in sales in both the Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific regions, and a 9 percent gain in Latin America.', 'By category, apparel revenue decreased 6 percent to $1 billion and footwear sales were down 7 percent to $331 million. Accessories revenue was flat at $105 million.', 'Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 45.2 percent, driven mainly by lower freight costs. However this number was partially impacted by higher sales to the off-price channel and increased promotional activities in the DTC business.', 'In a call with analysts Thursday morning, Linnartz said despite “a challenging retail environment and consumer buying behavior that was inconsistent market to market,” she believes her strategy is beginning to pay off.', '“Following our ‘Protect This House 3’ plan launched last spring, I am pleased with our progress in driving global demand creation and our focus on evolving and simplifying our approach to connecting with consumers. I also feel good about how our efforts are shaping up to deliver elevated design and products to the athletes we serve in nearly 100 countries around the world, strengthening our ability to drive success across our largest growth opportunities in footwear, sports style and our women’s business.”', 'Turning to the U.S. situation, she admitted the company still has “much more work to do to become a healthier business capable of returning to growth in our largest market. Inconsistency has permeated our U.S. business over the past years in how we go to market across consumers, customers and geographies, how our product is created and delivered with a consistent design language, channel segmentation and how we show up in our owned physical and digital businesses. With a critical mass of work underway, an additional analysis that will yield more work and decision points in the months ahead, we are on right path to addressing these inconsistencies and turning them into strength.”', 'The biggest issue is within the wholesale arena, where promotional activity impacted the company’s performance, she said on the call. And the company is anticipating markdowns to continue to impact business through the rest of the fiscal year.', 'Linnartz said the company is also working to improve its North American e-commerce business and is exploring ways to reduce promotional activity and “create a more premium online presence.” And she said the recent addition of Kara Trent as head of the Americas as key to its turnaround plan.', 'She pointed to the leadership team she has installed at the company since joining as another positive. Two-thirds of the management are new to the company and include executives in product, design, supply chain and communications. Under Armour is still searching for a chief marketing officer.', 'Yassine Saidi, a 20-year veteran of Puma and Adidas, joined the company last week as chief product officer and will oversee Under Armour’s apparel and footwear, working closely with John Varvatos, who is the company’s head of design. Updated apparel designs will be introduced this spring, including new offerings in the Unstoppable Air Vent for men and the Meridian performance apparel for women. The latter, she said, is leading to strong bookings from wholesale partners.', 'Linnartz also singled out footwear as “our single most significant growth opportunity.” But with sales down 7 percent in the quarter due to softer demand in North America, she admitted “we have a lot of work to do.” The company is searching for a new head of footwear to evolve the strategies and support long-term growth.', 'In the near- to midterm, she said, the company will remain focused on cost management and profitability as it continues to “understand where and how we are putting our resources to work to drive the best possible returns…especially in North America.”', 'There have been some recent wins, she outlined, including the launch of the latest iterations of the Curry basketball shoes as well as a collaboration with Bruce Lee for apparel and footwear. Stephen Curry is a longtime Under Amour ambassador and the company recently signed De’Aaron Fox of the Sacramento Kings as well and will introduce a signature shoe for him later this year.', 'Regarding the earnings, William Blair said it viewed fiscal 2024 as a “transitional year” for the company and remains “optimistic on the potential for consistent revenue growth alongside ongoing margin expansion beyond fiscal 2024.” But the firm cautioned that Under Armour still needs to maintain a strong brand image and product offering in an industry with intense competition, historically high turnover rates in senior management and majority voting control still held by founder and executive chairman Kevin Plank.', 'Tom Nikic of Wedbush called the results “surprisingly better-than-expected” and “while there’s still a lot of work to be done, and it will take a while for changes to take hold, we think there’s reason to hope for better days ahead.” He cited the low cost of the stock so the “risk/reward is skewed highly positively if [Under Armour] can put it all together.”', 'Best of WWD', 'Harvey Nichols Sees Sales Dip, Losses Widen in Year Marred by Closures', 'Nike Logs $1.3 Billion Profit, But Supply Chain Issues Persist', 'Zegna Shares Start Trading on New York Stock Exchange']"

The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 29, 2024."", ""When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss."", 'Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher.

Now I'll turn it over to Charlie."", 'Charles Frederick Lowrey', ""Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to comment on our CFO transition. As you saw from yesterday's news release, Yanela Frias, President of Prudential's Group Insurance Business, has been named Executive Vice President and CFO of Prudential, succeeding Ken Tanji. As a 27-year veteran of Prudential, Yanela is a seasoned executive who brings a deep understanding of our business and industry as well as significant finance, operations and leadership experience. I'm sure you'll enjoy getting to know her as she starts her new role. Yanela will become CFO effective March 15, and Ken will stay on for a 6-month period to ensure a smooth transition. Ken has been a great partner and friend and has had a distinguished 35-year career at Prudential. I don't need to go back far to articulate his impact. Most recently, as CFO, Ken guided Prudential through the financial challenges of the COVID pandemic and the market volatility that followed. During the same time, his leadership on strategic initiatives meaningfully contributed to our goals of becoming less market-sensitive and more nimble. We are grateful to Ken for his many contributions over more than 3 decades and wish him well. Now let's turn to my remarks for the quarter. Our financial results for 2023 reflect continued strong sales momentum across our insurance and retirement businesses and solid underlying earnings growth. The fourth quarter capped a productive year of continued transformation to make Prudential a higher growth, more capital-efficient and more nimble company. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment, maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment and deliver long-term sustainable growth. Turning to Slide 3. I will begin today by sharing a few examples of how we are transforming our business to drive future growth and unlock value for all our stakeholders. Over the course of 2023, we executed several attractive transactions adding to our capital efficiency. We reinsured a $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities, reducing our market sensitivity. We closed a $10 billion transaction of structured settlement annuities with Prismic, a life and annuity reinsurance company we launched. Prismic will enhance our mutually-reinforcing business system and drive future growth by leveraging our differentiated brands, global asset and liability origination capabilities and multichannel distribution. In addition, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Somerset Re for a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life reserves, which will release capital and increase earnings. We continue to strengthen the capabilities of our market-leading businesses through strategic M&A, expanded distribution channels and created new products and solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers across the globe and to support future growth. In PGIM, we enhanced our capabilities in the attractive area of private credit and direct lending by acquiring a majority stake in Deerpath Capital, which closed in December. To further provide investors with a cohesive offering, we brought together PGIM's private alternatives capabilities into one global team with the formation of PGIM Private Alternatives. Internationally, we continue to expand third-party distribution in Latin America through Mercado Libre, reaching a milestone of close to 300,000 policies in force last quarter. In Japan, we launched expanded inheritance and new investment products to diversify our portfolio and meet a broader range of customer needs. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business secured its second largest longevity risk transfer transaction ever with one of the biggest life insurance companies in the Netherlands. This marks our first international reinsurance deal in the Dutch market. Retirement strategies also worked with Fidelity Investments to address growing consumer demand for a workplace retirement income solution. Our Prudential SimplyIncome product, a new single premium immediate annuity is now available to employer-based retirement plans administered by Fidelity. In addition, to solidify our leadership and expand our addressable market and structured settlements, we launched a new index structured settlement annuity product. We also continue to create a more nimble and efficient company to meet the changing needs of our customers and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace. This included evolving our operating model and organizational structure to better support customers at the business level and leveraging technology to bring products to market faster. Our business and technology teams together launched an average of 1 new or enhanced product every 2 weeks in 2023. Additionally, we are strategically leaning into partnerships with cutting-edge technology firms within our group business to increase the speed of innovation, add capabilities and enhance customer experience. We entered 2024 with momentum and optimism as we have expanded and diversified our product offerings, enhanced customer and client experiences and continued to reinvest in our businesses for sustainable long-term growth. Moving to Slide 4. Our transformation strategy and growth initiatives are supported by Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management framework, which have allowed us to confidently navigate the macroeconomic environment. Our AA rated financial strength includes a strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.1 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management. Turning to Slide 5. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders. For 2024, our board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase. And now I will turn it over to Rob."", 'Robert Michael Falzon', ""Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $5.5 billion or $11.62 per share for 2023 and $1.3 billion or $2.58 per share in the fourth quarter. These results reflect an increase in the underlying earnings power of our businesses, including the benefits of strong sales growth and higher interest rates. This was partially offset by pressure on variable investment income and higher expenses, primarily due to a $200 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $374 million higher than our after-tax AOI, primarily driven by net investment gains due to declining rates. Turning to the quarterly operating results of our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower other related revenues driven by lower incentive fees and agency income and higher expenses. This was partially offset by higher asset management fees, including the benefits from our acquisition of Deerpath Capital and of launching Prismic. Results of our U.S. businesses primarily reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates and lower expenses. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we pivot to less market-sensitive products. The earnings in our international businesses primarily reflected less favorable underwriting results, including unfavorable policyholder behavior partially offset by lower expenses. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM, our global active investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance over the past year has also driven attractive long-term performance, with over 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5- and 10-year periods.PGIM's assets under management increased 6% to $1.3 trillion from the year-ago quarter, primarily resulting from market appreciation. Third-party net outflows in the fourth quarter totaled $13.5 billion. Institutional outflows of $6.3 billion were driven primarily by a large redemption of a low fee equity index mandate and redemptions in public fixed income resulting from client rebalancing and liquidity needs. Retail outflows of $7.2 billion were primarily driven by equity, sub-advised mandates and fixed income outflows. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer, Prisma, are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our PGIM Private Alternatives business, which has assets of approximately $240 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform of $9 billion during the quarter benefited from robust private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive growth by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential.Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by strong international reinsurance sales and our best quarter for structured settlements since 2016.International reinsurance sales included a $9.2 billion transaction in the Netherlands and with the recently passed Dutch Pension reform legislation, we anticipate this market will continue to grow over time. Individual Retirement posted $2.1 billion in sales, reaching the highest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, which increased about 20% from the year ago quarter, while fixed annuity sales have doubled. Our Individual Life sales increased 33% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our product pivot strategy towards more capital-efficient products. Variable life protection and accumulation products represented approximately 70% of sales for the year, including a benefit from our recently launched FlexGuard Life product. In Group Insurance, we continue to execute on our strategy of product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our full year sales were up 11% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. Group's full year adjusted operating income was the highest in the past 15 years and included favorable underwriting experience. As a result, we are lowering our benefits ratio target range by 2 percentage points to 83% to 87%. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs.In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Sales in our international businesses were up 24% compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 21%, including the benefits of recent product launches in Japan to diversify our product offering.In addition, Brazil sales were up 24%, reflecting growth across all channels and leading to a full-year record. Gibraltar sales were up 27%, primarily driven by higher independent agency sales and growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken."", 'Kenneth Yutaka Tanji', ""Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2024 relative to our fourth quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.3 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.58 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: First, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $95 million; second, underwriting experience was below expectations by $15 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect $30 million of unfavorable seasonality in the first quarter; and last, we included an adjustment of $240 million for expenses and other items. This includes the $200 million restructuring charge related to changes in our organizational structure as well as adjustments for typical seasonality related to the timing of expenses and premium. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.36 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if we exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.50.The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased significantly over the past year, while we have also made strategic progress improving our risk profile. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2024 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are above our targets, and we expect PICA's year-end RBC ratio to be greater than 425%. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.1 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses for long-term growth and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to confidently navigate the macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we are maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI.', 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""Ken, good luck. The -- just looking at the 65% free cash flow conversion, I know that bullet was removed from the capital slides. I just want to make sure that, that's still the target. And then relatedly, when thinking about Japan economic solvency implementation, can you comment on how you see that impacting sources and uses of capital and capital generation over the next few years?"", 'Kenneth Yutaka Tanji', ""Tom, it's Ken and thanks for the good luck. I appreciate it. The -- we didn't remove that comment. I think it's pretty well understood that our free cash flow ratio has been about 65% over time and that's reflective of our business mix and our growth. It's going to vary period to period, but it will be about 60 -- it's been about 65% on average. And we think that's reflective of our approach to balance growth with sustainable and diversified sources of cash flow. Actually, in 2023, you'll see that cash flows were actually higher than that for a variety of reasons. So no change there. In terms of ESR in Japan, again, we believe our businesses in Japan are well capitalized and financially strong. And that would be evident in any reasonable capital standard. We're certainly working with the FSA, advocating for reasonable and responsible standards, but we also have strategies to adapt to that new regime as well. We could reinsure business internally, to the U.S. or Bermuda. We could reinsure externally. So we have a number of strategies to manage in the new regime, and that's something that we're working on."", 'Thomas George Gallagher', ""Got you. And then just a follow-up, if I could. Strength in Japan and international sales more broadly, I thought, was kind of notable in the quarter. Can you comment on the competition in those markets what's driving the stronger sales? And do you think that's going to translate into stronger top line? Because I know it's been sort of flattish, but do you expect that to inflect at all in '24 or '25?"", 'Andrew Francis Sullivan', ""So Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question, and thank you for noting that. You've heard me say this before. Sales are an outcome of strong brand, great product and outstanding distribution. We feel that we clearly have a competitive advantage in those areas, particularly as it relates to Japan and Brazil.As you heard from Rob, we are very pleased that our sales were up 24% year-over-year, up 21% in Life Planner and 27% in Gibraltar. Once again, that success was very broad-based as we saw growth in every channel in Brazil and across life planners, independent agents and the bank channel in Japan. In Japan, we continue to see lift from higher sales of our U.S. dollar product, really supported by the higher U.S. interest rate. But also clearly, our work on innovating our product designs and enhancing our customer experience, in particular, in digital is paying off. If you look at Brazil and the results there, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth in every channel. Our Life Planner channel outperformed throughout all of last year with high Life Planner retention and strong productivity. On top of that, we continue to expand and strengthen our third-party distribution. Once again, we saw really strong results flowing from Itau Bank. And we also remain quite pleased that the expansion of our partnership with Mercado Libre. So you asked about the outlook. As always, our priority is going to be to deliver strong value to our customers while achieving healthy levels of profitability. But we are optimistic about our ability to grow both the top and bottom line of our business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW.', 'Ryan Joel Krueger', 'First, can you provide some more color on the key drivers of the RBC ratio improvement in the quarter? I know you had given us the exact RBC during the year, but it seems like it increased a fair amount in the quarter.', 'Kenneth Yutaka Tanji', ""Ryan, it's Ken. Just to remind people, RBC is something that is reported annually. And so the greater than 25% is where we believe RBC will be at the end of the year. But again, that will be filed in much greater detail at the end of the month. And so yes, we did have an improvement in our RBC ratio in 2023, and it's really a combination of a few things. One, our in-force businesses are generating free surplus, that's part of it. We had the benefit of admitting negative IMR with the regulatory change that was adopted during the year. We also had a reduction in our AAT reserves, generally from reaggregation of policies and investment portfolios, which created some efficiency. So it was a combination of that. And so overall, our capital position and flexibility has improved in 2023. And again, you'll see all that when we file our report at the end of February."", 'Ryan Joel Krueger', 'And then can you help us understand your sensitivity to short-term interest rates, specifically as we get closer to a potential Fed cutting cycle?', 'Kenneth Yutaka Tanji', ""Yes. Sure, Ryan. The bottom line is that there's -- we don't expect much net impact from short-term rates. We have cash and collateral balances that earn short-term yields. And that would generally be offset by interest rate derivatives from our investment portfolio, where we're actually paying short-term rates and receiving fixed to manage duration. The two generally offset each other."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.', 'Taylor Alexander Scott', ""So I wanted to touch on the capital as well. I mean you're in a much stronger position sort of going into '24 compared to a year ago. I just wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about priorities for deploying that capital? I know at times you've talked about finding some ways to enhance growth. I mean certainly, organic growth across some of your businesses has begun to pick up as well. But how are you thinking about all of that? And how do you look at driving more growth into the business?"", 'Charles Frederick Lowrey', ""Sure. Alex, it's Charlie. I'll take that. Thanks for the question. We have said that we've always wanted -- that we want to be good stewards of capital. And as a result, we want to have a consistent disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses, as you said, and to shareholders. And there are really 3 aspects to our approach on which we focus. First and foremost is maintaining our rock-solid balance sheet and financial strength, which is critical to fulfilling the promises we make to our customers and clients. Second is investing both organically and through programmatic acquisitions to support sustainable long-term growth of our businesses. And the third is returning excess capital to shareholders as we have in the past. And in this quarter, we've done all 3. We've deployed capital to support strong sales across our businesses, including several new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We closed on the Deerpath acquisition for PGIM, and we returned over $700 million to shareholders. So we'll continue to have this consistent and disciplined approach as we go forward."", 'Taylor Alexander Scott', 'The second question I had is on PGIM flows. I was hoping you could just provide a little more color on what you expect going into 2024 as some of these headwinds begin to abate that have driven some outflows.', 'Andrew Francis Sullivan', ""Yes. Alex, it's Andy. Thanks for your question. We're not satisfied with the recent flows performance of the business, and we have been, and we're going to continue to take the appropriate actions to restore that performance to historical norms. That really starts with ensuring that we have a range of strategies and vehicles so that we can broadly serve our customers. You've seen us continue to intentionally invest into the business to accomplish just that.So we've continued our expansion into private alternatives with the acquisitions of Montana Capital Partners and Deerpath. You've also seen us launch new vehicles like exchange traded funds and ESG strategies. All that work adds to an already broad and diversified portfolio. The second thing I would tell you is flows and active management are correlated with investment performance. And our performance strengthened throughout all of 2023, but flows can lag. So that's one of the reasons we're constructive on the outlook looking forward. Third, we've continued -- we've not taken our foot off the gas on investing in distribution, because those 3 things, product breadth, investment results and distribution lead to active flows over the longer term. Let me also add that like others, I'm sure you're hearing, we believe that the record money market assets that are sitting on the sideline will flow back into fixed income once inflation and rates are stabilized and the rate trajectory, people are more confident in it. We're ready to capitalize on that given the strength of our investment performance with 81% of our assets outperforming benchmark over 5 and 10 years.So clearly not satisfied about the recent flow performance, but optimistic looking forward. I would just end by noting we saw a pickup in gross inflows towards the end of 4Q, and that has continued into this year. So we're optimistic."", 'Operator', 'Next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', 'My first question is on, I guess, sticking with PGIM. In the slides, you still call out -- you call out programmatic M&A there. Can you just provide an update just on the pipeline of transactions and what you might be thinking about there?', 'Andrew Francis Sullivan', ""So thanks, Elyse. It's Andy. So I won't get obviously specific around pipeline, but maybe just bring it up a level. We've demonstrated our strong ability to grow PGIM organically over a long period of time. So we certainly don't look at it as we need M&A to grow. That said, we do remain interested in augmenting our organic growth with mergers and acquisitions. Montana Capital Partners, PGIM Custom Harvest and then obviously, our closure of Deerpath in December, those are great examples of us adding capabilities in higher growth, higher fee areas of the industry. So as we look forward, we're going to continue to look to globalize the business, and we're going to focus on higher growth, higher fee areas, so areas like private alternatives and real asset capabilities. Clearly, periods of time like this that are disruptive can lead to opportunities, so we're making sure that we're in the know and in the flow on what's going on. We've also seen an uptick in activity in the marketplace. But as always, we're going to remain patient and disciplined in our approach."", 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""And then my second one is on the RBC. So it's now greater than 425%, right? And you guys saw a nice lift in the quarter. Would you look to maintain PICA RBC ratio around this level? Or is that something that you would maybe manage down over time and look to bring more capital to parent?"", 'Kenneth Yutaka Tanji', ""Yes, Elyse, it's Ken. We're well within our AA financial objectives on an RBC basis. Now it's not the only thing that matters for our credit rating. But on that measure, we're where we need to be, and we have flexibility. So we -- again, we'll balance maintaining financial strength, which is obviously important to our value proposition growth and also distribution to shareholders. So we're balancing all 3 of those objectives."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies.', 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', ""First of all, thank you to Ken for all of your help over the years. I really appreciate it. My first question is just on the SGUL deal with Somerset Re. If I remember correctly, that was supposed to close in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we haven't seen an announcement on that yet, so maybe just an update there. And are you still expecting $450 million of proceeds when that deal closes?"", 'Robert Michael Falzon', ""Suneet, it's Rob. Yes, the deal continues to proceed toward closing. Our counterparty has actually received its regulatory approval. We've got 1 or 2 final steps on our end, but we expect a closing in this quarter. Just a couple of reminders. One is, recall it is retrospective to the beginning of the year, so 1/1/24. And with respect to the financial impacts, annual earnings as well as onetime closing costs and capital, we'll update that in an announcement once we close."", 'Suneet Laxman L. Kamath', ""Got it. And then I guess on PGIM, totally appreciate the strong 5- and 10-year numbers, but it looks like the 3-year number, 63% outperforming is a little bit lower. Is that something that we should -- that could have an impact on kind of the flow dynamics? Or is there something maybe that will drop off? Or -- I just want to get some color on how you're thinking about that 3-year number."", 'Andrew Francis Sullivan', ""Yes, Suneet, I would focus on how much our investment performance has strengthened here in the near term. We did have a period of time -- we're an active manager. We have many high-conviction strategies designed to produce alpha. We went through a brief period in '21, '22, where we did see a dip in performance specifically in our fixed income business, but that performance has strengthened quite nicely and is very, very strong right now. So we don't expect that to have a major impact on us looking forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""So first, a question for Charlie, maybe on capital and just capital deployment overall. Can you talk about what your priorities are and where do -- and how do you think about M&A and/or share buybacks? Because it seems like you certainly have the capacity to do more in buybacks given your capital generation than you've been doing, but not sure if you're prioritizing other things instead as well."", 'Charles Frederick Lowrey', ""Sure. As I mentioned to Alex earlier, we do -- we have a consistent and balanced approach. And as a result, Jimmy, we really look for, again, the 3 things. One is to make sure that we have a very strong balance sheet, which we do, as Ken was talking about. The second is to invest organically in our businesses, and you've seen us do that, and we will continue to do that to support sales growth to support the growth of all our businesses as we go forward. And then to look for acquisitions that make sense. Those would be in higher growth areas. It could be in distribution, it could be in geography as well. We also see tremendous opportunities right now in the marketplace, in places like PRT, right, where we are one of the leaders in this business. We think there's going to be tremendous volume there. And that's really good business for us as we go forward. And Caroline, you may want to talk about that in one moment. The final thing, as we've talked about, is returning excess capital to shareholders. We've done that in the past. And if we think we have excess capital, we'll do so. But we're going to evaluate that relative to our investment in our businesses and the opportunities that come along. And Caroline, you might want to talk about one in particular."", 'Caroline Ann Feeney', ""Yes, absolutely. So Jimmy, we did finish another strong year in pension risk transfer. We closed 11 transactions worth almost $6 billion finishing as the #2 pension risk transfer writer. And we've already built on that positive momentum this year with a $5 billion deal with Shell. It's our largest first quarter pension risk transfer ever. And with this win, Prudential now has completed 7 of the top 10 U.S. PRT transactions on record. We also see that strong sales trend continuing. It's driven by healthy pipelines due to favorable funding positions of over 100%. And last year's market volume was roughly $45 billion, and we do expect to see that healthy pipeline continue this year. And although the market is highly competitive with more new entrants, very few competitors have executed transactions exceeding $1 billion. And while transactions will continue to be episodic in our PRT business our expertise and our ability to handle large complex transactions and our leadership position in service delivery, we believe, will position us well to remain a leader in the market."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""Okay. And then just in Latin America, can you share what your views are in terms of potential pension reform in the Chilean market, and what the reasonable case or sort of a worst-case impact would be on Prudential's business there?"", 'Andrew Francis Sullivan', ""Yes. So Jimmy, it's Andy. Thank you for your question. As we've talked about before, our priority is always delivering for our customers day in and day out. We're very leaned into what's in their best interest. As you would expect, because of that, we believe in being very proactive on advocating on their behalf. We're going to continue to advocate for reforms that improve the pension outcomes in Latin America and specifically for the citizens of Chile.Just to give you an update, in Chile, the constitutional referendum was rejected on December 17, but after 2 failed attempts. So President Boric really has moved on and is now focused squarely on pension reform. And there is a proposal that's advancing through Congress. That bill proposes to eliminate AFPs and to increase employer contributions to 6%. We're closely monitoring that situation as the passage would impact our Habitat JV. But I would say just a couple of things. Our Habitat JV is a high-quality, very well-run business. It's been working to actively diversify across countries and into voluntary savings offerings. And if you take a step back, just recognize that joint venture, while it's obviously a larger component of our emerging markets, it's not a material contributor to PFI earnings. So we'll obviously stay very close to it, and we'll let you know when we have any more clarity."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Joel Hurwitz from Dowling & Partners.', 'Joel Hurwitz', 'So I know lapses have periodically been an issue in Japan just given the exchange rates. It looks like there was a pretty sizable quarter-over-quarter reduction in the in-force amount in both international businesses in the quarter. Can you just talk about what you saw in terms of lapsation there?', 'Andrew Francis Sullivan', ""Yes. So thanks, Joel, it's Andy. So let me just talk about the decline in the in-force. First, as I always start, we're exceptionally proud of our Japanese businesses. They've been very consistent and stable contributors to Prudential for a very long time.With that, there are a few factors, though, that are impacting the life insurance in-force amounts. First, this is important to note, a significant portion of our recent sales are investment contracts, and that really reflects what customers are looking to buy. Those sales do not include a material life component, but are contributing to our earnings. Second, we are seeing natural runoff in the older life blocks, particularly in the legacy yen business in Gibraltar. And then as we've talked about in previous quarters, with the recent yen depreciation, we've seen a modestly elevated level of surrenders. But all that said, we are confident in our ability to grow and diversify our Japanese businesses across insurance, investment and retirement security. And we're continuing to invest in them."", 'Joel Hurwitz', ""Okay, helpful. And then switching gears to Group. So you reduced the benefit ratio target there. Can you just talk about the overall drivers to the reduction there? And then what's the growth outlook for that business? It looks like top line for full year was roughly flat. Just any color on growth expectations there."", 'Caroline Ann Feeney', ""Yes, absolutely, Joel. It's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. So first of all, I'll start off by saying we had another very strong quarter for Group insurance and we're very pleased with the full year results of this business. And we believe we're in that strong position in Group given the progress we've made in executing on our strategy. And our future earnings power will reflect the efforts we've made to grow in a disciplined and profitable manner. We continue to focus on diversifying our business by expanding in the under 5,000 live market and the association segments. We're adding new products like supplemental health and continuing our growth in disability. And we made progress in that diversification effort, increasing our disability premiums and fees at a higher rate than before. And our supplemental health premiums also grew at strong double-digit annual growth rates. And this diversification is driving stronger core earnings with higher margins. So as for our performance, our full year benefits ratio was just over 83 percentage points. It includes very strong performance in our Life block in the second and third quarters of last year and record disability results in the first half of the year. While we don't expect that record performance to continue indefinitely, there are certainly other factors to consider.So overall, Joel, I'd say that our Group business is growing. It's doing so at attractive margins with COVID having transitioned to an endemic state, combined with our diversification strategy I just walked you through as well as investments we've made in improving our claims management capabilities and strategic partnerships, we believe we'll see that underwriting performance and earnings power continue to improve. And that is why we are confident with our decision in lowering our benefits ratio guidance to be 83% to 87% for the year. And in terms of just future earnings power as well, I gave you some color there as well, Joel. We believe the future earnings power of Group Insurance will continue to be strong as we continue to grow and execute on our strategy."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James.', 'Wilma Carter Jackson Burdis', ""I'm just wondering if there's been any activity with Prismic. Seeing that you guys have been focused on the sales of fixed annuity and also with this large PRT deal. So if could give us an update there, please."", 'Robert Michael Falzon', ""Wilma, it's Rob. So as we've articulated before, we're quite enthusiastic about Prismic and more broadly about what we see to be the opportunities that are coming out of the intersection between asset management and insurance and specifically the role that Prismic can play in helping us to execute against that opportunity. We believe it will create avenues of growth across our businesses, not specifically for the PRT transaction that we recently announced, but the opportunity to be a source of financing for sales growth, both in the retirement marketplace and our other businesses on a go-forward basis.Our investors, which are extremely large global institutional investors share our aspirations, both from a directional standpoint and from a quantum standpoint. So our expectation is to go well beyond the initial $10 billion structured securities or structured settlements transaction that we completed. It's going to include some level of ongoing balance sheet optimization. It's going to include, as I noted, financing the growth across our businesses. I think what's unique in a way about Prismic is the appetite by it and its investors for longer duration and more complex liabilities. And we're also going to look to do third-party blocks as well in Prismic, all of which will [enable] the benefit of increasing the assets under management for our PGIM business."", 'Wilma Carter Jackson Burdis', ""And could you talk a little bit about the buyback. I think you guys said that the $1 billion authorization for 2024 -- certainly, with -- would you guys sell blocks and run off earnings a little bit? It's good to see more capital returns. So can you just talk about how you guys are thinking through that."", 'Kenneth Yutaka Tanji', ""Yes, it's Ken. Yes, we've had a very consistent approach to shareholder distributions using both dividends and share repurchases as a way to return capital. Our share repurchases for this year was approved by the board, and they had considered our capital position, our outlook for free cash flow but also opportunities to deploy that capital into organic growth, as Charlie discussed, in particular, the very robust PRT market. So all those things factored into it. We increased our dividend again. That's -- now we've increased that 16 years in a row. So again, it all factors into what we think is a very consistent approach, balancing all our objectives as well. So I hope that color helps."", 'Operator', 'Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler.', 'John Bakewell Barnidge', ""Best of luck, Ken. My first question, I appreciate -- if we could go to the Group Insurance business, I appreciate the benefit ratio guidance. But is there an expense savings story in disability coming up? I can't help but notice improvement in administrative expenses in recent quarters. And with COVID moving endemic, the ramping up of expenses, should that fall to the side?"", 'Caroline Ann Feeney', ""Yes. So John, it's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. In terms of our overall expense management, you may have seen we saw 100 basis point improvement in our admin ratio from the year ago quarter. That is driven by both business growth and continued expense discipline. And we will continue to focus on expense efficiencies and obviously then would regularly adjust our operating models to ensure the appropriate levels of service going forward.In terms of disability overall, I would say across group disability, results were driven by our focus on effective claims management, including those short- and long-term disability as well as absence in family leave. We also benefited from the continued tailwinds of strong employment and a high interest rate environment, and our disability business had an outstanding year. I would also just want to point out something else strategically, we're doing on the disability side as we continue to grow that area. We've actually invested, John, in improving our claims management process through a strategic partnership with EvolutionIQ. This is a provider of AI-driven technology that provides real-time monitoring leading to increased recoveries. So overall, I'd say in terms of expense management, we remain highly disciplined and also, obviously, very much focused in terms of our pricing discipline. The evidence there is our ability to accomplish all this growth in maintaining our price competitiveness. But the fact that as we continue to grow our book, we're also not afraid to walk away if the pricing just doesn't make sense on any particular case.So overall, we remain confident in our decision to lower benefit ratio guidance and feel very comfortable with our expense management and our pricing discipline."", 'John Bakewell Barnidge', ""My follow-up question, when you talk about globalizing the PGIM business, are there markets you're not large in size that you want to get bigger in? Where does Prismic sit within that growth opportunity for PGIM internationally?"", 'Andrew Francis Sullivan', ""So John, I'll start out and then, Rob, if you want to tail in, you can jump in. So when we talk about globalizing the business, I think it's important to recognize that a majority of our assets under management today are in the United States. So we've been actively, for many years now, working to expand across Europe and Asia and have invested quite heavily in distribution on both the institutional and retail side of the business. That said, as we look to continue to broaden and diversify our mix of both asset classes, but geographies, we would look to Europe and Asia as key geographies that we're most interested in growing."", 'Robert Michael Falzon', ""John, it's Rob. Just following up on Andy. Within Asia and with respect to Prismic, I think what I'd note is we see a huge opportunity in Japan, both with regard to, as Ken alluded to earlier in the call, optimizing our own book, but also with respect to the sort of opportunities we see with third parties in that marketplace as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi.', 'Michael Augustus Ward', ""Sorry to be the one to ask. Just curious if there's any update on commercial real estate side for you guys. It looked like the LTV deteriorated a little bit. Just kind of wondering how you feel about any kind of watch list or resolutions that you've made last year, too."", 'Robert Michael Falzon', ""This is Rob. So I'll take your question, Mike. So a couple of thoughts. One, from an overall market standpoint, let me start there. From a peak to trough, what we've seen is across the market, about a 16% correction, and that number relates to what I'll call, institutional quality real estate, the sort of things that we invest in or we lend against. And that's on an unlevered basis.Our estimate is that the peak to trough in this cycle across real estate types is going to probably be a little over 20%. So we've got 5% or 6% probably left in the way of price correction yet to experience. Now within that, office, obviously, has corrected much more severely, closer to 30% to date, and probably has another 10%, 15% yet to go.Because the construction of our portfolio, it's significantly underweight, office and because of the overall quality of the portfolio and the diversification of it across geography and property types. And importantly, because this is a portfolio that's directly originated by PGIM with a team that's deep and averages some 25 years of industry experience, we're actually finding that our portfolio is holding up quite well. So loan to values across the portfolio were about 58% and our discount -- our debt service coverage ratios remain right around 2.5%.Within our overall portfolio, our actual valuations increased about 6% during the course of 2023 despite the fact that we saw a double-digit decline in the office component of our portfolio. But again, because that office component is only 2% of our assets or 50% -- about 14% of our mortgages, the performance of the rest of the portfolio has offset that. So with regard to portfolio performance, we're actually feeling quite good.The last thing that you asked about was sort of what we're seeing in watch list, et cetera. I guess the way I would describe that, Mike, is that the first -- if we look at our experience with maturities during 2023, we had about $2 billion worth of scheduled maturities. Of those, we provided modifications for 4 -- less than $400 million of that $2 billion with those modifications providing longer-term extensions.The remainder of all of those maturities was resolved favorably through refinancing payoffs or short-term extensions that then led or are leading to subsequent payoffs. In the upcoming year 2024, we've got about $3 billion of maturities coming on. That's about 6% of the portfolio that's maturing. And while we don't expect to be immune from this cycle by any means, we do expect that on a relative basis, we'll be quite resilient. We increased our reserves in the real estate portfolio to around $370 million as of the end of the year and that represents about 72 basis points, and we think that that's well provisioned against the portfolio, again, given what we've experienced in the underlying quality of that portfolio."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments."", 'Charles Frederick Lowrey', 'So thank you again for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped a year of continued growth and evolution for Prudential. Our strategy, coupled with our mutually reinforcing business system positions us well to deliver long-term sustainable growth to all our stakeholders.

Before we begin, I'd like to comment on our CFO transition. As you saw from yesterday's news release, Yanela Frias, president of Prudential's Group Insurance Business, has been named executive vice president and CFO of Prudential, succeeding Ken Tanji. As a 27-year veteran of Prudential, Yanela is a seasoned executive who brings a deep understanding of our business and industry as well as significant finance, operations, and leadership experience."", ""I'm sure you'll enjoy getting to know her as she starts her new role. Yanela will become CFO effective March 15th, and Ken will stay on for a six-month period to ensure a smooth transition. Ken has been a great partner and friend and has had a distinguished 35-year career at Prudential. I don't need to go back far to articulate his impact."", ""Most recently, as CFO, Ken guided Prudential through the financial challenges of the COVID pandemic and the market volatility that followed. During the same time, his leadership on strategic initiatives meaningfully contributed to our goals of becoming less market-sensitive and more nimble. We are grateful to Ken for his many contributions over more than three decades and wish him well. Now let's turn to my remarks for the quarter."", 'Our financial results for 2023 reflect continued strong sales momentum across our insurance and retirement businesses and solid underlying earnings growth. The fourth quarter capped a productive year of continued transformation to make Prudential a higher growth, more capital-efficient, and more nimble company. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment, maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment, and deliver long-term sustainable growth. Turning to Slide 3.', 'I will begin today by sharing a few examples of how we are transforming our business to drive future growth and unlock value for all our stakeholders. Over the course of 2023, we executed several attractive transactions adding to our capital efficiency. We reinsured a $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities, reducing our market sensitivity. We closed a $10 billion transaction of structured settlement annuities with Prismic, a life and annuity reinsurance company we launched.', 'Prismic will enhance our mutually reinforcing business system and drive future growth by leveraging our differentiated brands, global asset and liability origination capabilities, and multichannel distribution. In addition, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Somerset Re for a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life reserves, which will release capital and increase earnings. We continue to strengthen the capabilities of our market-leading businesses through strategic M&A, expanded distribution channels, and created new products and solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers across the globe and to support future growth. In PGIM, we enhanced our capabilities in the attractive area of private credit and direct lending by acquiring a majority stake in Deerpath Capital, which closed in December.', ""To further provide investors with a cohesive offering, we brought together PGIM's private alternatives capabilities into one global team with the formation of PGIM Private Alternatives. Internationally, we continue to expand third-party distribution in Latin America through Mercado Libre, reaching a milestone of close to 300,000 policies in force last quarter. In Japan, we launched expanded inheritance and new investment products to diversify our portfolio and meet a broader range of customer needs. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business secured its second-largest longevity risk transfer transaction ever with one of the biggest life insurance companies in the Netherlands."", 'This marks our first international reinsurance deal in the Dutch market. Retirement strategies also worked with Fidelity Investments to address growing consumer demand for a workplace retirement income solution. Our Prudential SimplyIncome product, a new single premium immediate annuity is now available to employer-based retirement plans administered by Fidelity. In addition, to solidify our leadership and expand our addressable market and structured settlements, we launched a new index structured settlement annuity product.', 'We also continue to create a more nimble and efficient company to meet the changing needs of our customers and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace. This included evolving our operating model and organizational structure to better support customers at the business level and leveraging technology to bring products to market faster. Our business and technology teams together launched an average of one new or enhanced product every two weeks in 2023. Additionally, we are strategically leaning into partnerships with cutting-edge technology firms within our group business to increase the speed of innovation, add capabilities, and enhance customer experience.', ""We entered 2024 with momentum and optimism as we have expanded and diversified our product offerings, enhanced customer and client experiences, and continued to reinvest in our businesses for sustainable long-term growth. Moving to Slide 4. Our transformation strategy and growth initiatives are supported by Prudential's rock-solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management framework, which have allowed us to confidently navigate the macroeconomic environment. Our AA-rated financial strength includes a strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.1 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management."", 'Turning to Slide 5. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders. For 2024, our board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter.', 'This represents our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase. And now I will turn it over to Rob.', 'Rob Falzon -- Vice Chairman', ""Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S., and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $5.5 billion or $11.62 per share for 2023 and $1.3 billion or $2.58 per share in the fourth quarter."", 'These results reflect an increase in the underlying earnings power of our businesses, including the benefits of strong sales growth and higher interest rates. This was partially offset by pressure on variable investment income and higher expenses, primarily due to a $200 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $374 million higher than our after-tax AOI, primarily driven by net investment gains due to declining rates. Turning to the quarterly operating results of our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter.', 'PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower other related revenues driven by lower incentive fees and agency income, and higher expenses. This was partially offset by higher asset management fees, including the benefits from our acquisition of Deerpath Capital and of launching Prismic. Results of our U.S. businesses primarily reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates and lower expenses.', ""This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we pivot to less market-sensitive products. The earnings in our international businesses primarily reflected less favorable underwriting results, including unfavorable policyholder behavior partially offset by lower expenses. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM, our global active investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance over the past year has also driven attractive long-term performance, with over 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five- and 10-year periods."", ""PGIM's assets under management increased 6% to $1.3 trillion from the year-ago quarter, primarily resulting from market appreciation. Third-party net outflows in the fourth quarter totaled $13.5 billion. Institutional outflows of $6.3 billion were driven primarily by a large redemption of a low-fee equity index mandate and redemptions in public fixed income resulting from client rebalancing and liquidity needs. Retail outflows of $7.2 billion were primarily driven by equity, sub-advised mandates, and fixed income outflows."", ""As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise, and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer, Prisma, are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities."", ""In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our PGIM Private Alternatives business, which has assets of approximately $240 billion across private, corporate, and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt, and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform of $9 billion during the quarter benefited from robust private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S."", 'businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread, and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive growth by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by strong international reinsurance sales and our best quarter for structured settlements since 2016.', 'International reinsurance sales included a $9.2 billion transaction in the Netherlands and with the recently passed Dutch Pension reform legislation, we anticipate this market will continue to grow over time. Individual Retirement posted $2.1 billion in sales, reaching the highest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, which increased about 20% from the year-ago quarter, while fixed annuity sales have doubled. Our Individual Life sales increased 33% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting our product pivot strategy toward more capital-efficient products.', ""Variable life protection and accumulation products represented approximately 70% of sales for the year, including a benefit from our recently launched FlexGuard Life product. In Group Insurance, we continue to execute on our strategy of product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our full year sales were up 11% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. Group's full-year adjusted operating income was the highest in the past 15 years and included favorable underwriting experience."", 'As a result, we are lowering our benefits ratio target range by 2 percentage points to 83% to 87%. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings.', 'Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses, and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Sales in our international businesses were up 24% compared to the year-ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 21%, including the benefits of recent product launches in Japan to diversify our product offering.', 'In addition, Brazil sales were up 24%, reflecting growth across all channels and leading to a full-year record. Gibraltar sales were up 27%, primarily driven by higher independent agency sales and growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences, and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers.', ""And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken."", 'Ken Tanji -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2024 relative to our fourth-quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.3 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.58 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: First, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $95 million; second, underwriting experience was below expectations by $15 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect $30 million of unfavorable seasonality in the first quarter; and last, we included an adjustment of $240 million for expenses and other items."", ""This includes the $200 million restructuring charge related to changes in our organizational structure as well as adjustments for typical seasonality related to the timing of expenses and premium. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.36 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if we exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.50. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased significantly over the past year, while we have also made strategic progress improving our risk profile."", 'While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2024 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating.', ""Our regulatory capital ratios are above our targets, and we expect PICA's year-end RBC ratio to be greater than 425%. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.1 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses for long-term growth and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth."", ""We continue to confidently navigate the macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we are maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.', 'Tom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Good morning. Ken, good luck. The -- just looking at the 65% free cash flow conversion, I know that bullet was removed from the capital slides. I just want to make sure that, that's still the target."", 'And then relatedly, when thinking about Japan economic solvency implementation, can you comment on how you see that impacting sources and uses of capital and capital generation over the next few years?', 'Ken Tanji -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Hey, Tom. It's Ken and thanks for the good luck. I appreciate it. The -- we didn't remove that comment."", ""I think it's pretty well understood that our free cash flow ratio has been about 65% over time and that's reflective of our business mix and our growth. It's going to vary period to period, but it will be about 60 -- it's been about 65% on average. And we think that's reflective of our approach to balance growth with sustainable and diversified sources of cash flow. Actually, in 2023, you'll see that cash flows were actually higher than that for a variety of reasons."", ""So no change there. In terms of ESR in Japan, again, we believe our businesses in Japan are well capitalized and financially strong. And that would be evident in any reasonable capital standard. We're certainly working with the FSA, advocating for reasonable and responsible standards, but we also have strategies to adapt to that new regime as well."", ""We could reinsure business internally, to the U.S. or Bermuda. We could reinsure externally. So we have a number of strategies to manage in the new regime, and that's something that we're working on."", 'Tom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Gotcha. And then just a follow-up, if I could. Strength in Japan and international sales more broadly, I thought, was kind of notable in the quarter. Can you comment on the competition in those markets what's driving the stronger sales? And do you think that's going to translate into stronger top line? Because I know it's been sort of flattish, but do you expect that to inflect at all in '24 or '25?"", 'Andy Sullivan -- Head of International Businesses', ""So Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question, and thank you for noting that. You've heard me say this before. Sales are an outcome of strong brand, great product and outstanding distribution."", 'We feel that we clearly have a competitive advantage in those areas, particularly as it relates to Japan and Brazil. As you heard from Rob, we are very pleased that our sales were up 24% year over year, up 21% in Life Planner and 27% in Gibraltar. Once again, that success was very broad-based as we saw growth in every channel in Brazil and across life planners, independent agents, and the bank channel in Japan. In Japan, we continue to see lift from higher sales of our U.S.', 'dollar product, really supported by the higher U.S. interest rate. But also clearly, our work on innovating our product designs and enhancing our customer experience, in particular, in digital is paying off. If you look at Brazil and the results there, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth in every channel.', 'Our Life Planner channel outperformed throughout all of last year with high Life Planner retention and strong productivity. On top of that, we continue to expand and strengthen our third-party distribution. Once again, we saw really strong results flowing from Itau Bank. And we also remain quite pleased that the expansion of our partnership with Mercado Libre.', 'So you asked about the outlook. As always, our priority is going to be to deliver strong value to our customers while achieving healthy levels of profitability. But we are optimistic about our ability to grow both the top and bottom line of our business.', 'Tom Gallagher -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live.', 'Ryan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Hey. Thanks. Good morning. First, can you provide some more color on the key drivers of the RBC ratio improvement in the quarter? I know you had given us the exact RBC during the year, but it seems like it increased a fair amount in the quarter.', 'Ken Tanji -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Ryan, it's Ken. Just to remind people, RBC is something that is reported annually. And so the greater than 25% is where we believe RBC will be at the end of the year. But again, that will be filed in much greater detail at the end of the month."", ""And so yes, we did have an improvement in our RBC ratio in 2023, and it's really a combination of a few things. One, our in-force businesses are generating free surplus, that's part of it. We had the benefit of admitting negative IMR with the regulatory change that was adopted during the year. We also had a reduction in our AAT reserves, generally from reaggregation of policies and investment portfolios, which created some efficiency."", ""So it was a combination of that. And so overall, our capital position and flexibility has improved in 2023. And again, you'll see all that when we file our report at the end of February."", 'Ryan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'And then can you help us understand your sensitivity to short-term interest rates, specifically as we get closer to a potential Fed cutting cycle?', 'Ken Tanji -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Sure, Ryan. The bottom line is that there's -- we don't expect much net impact from short-term rates. We have cash and collateral balances that earn short-term yields."", ""And that would generally be offset by interest rate derivatives from our investment portfolio, where we're actually paying short-term rates and receiving fixed to manage duration. The two generally offset each other."", 'Ryan Krueger -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Our next question today is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.', 'Alex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Hi. So I wanted to touch on the capital as well. I mean you're in a much stronger position sort of going into '24 compared to a year ago. I just wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about priorities for deploying that capital? I know at times you've talked about finding some ways to enhance growth."", 'I mean certainly, organic growth across some of your businesses has begun to pick up as well. But how are you thinking about all of that? And how do you look at driving more growth into the business?', 'Charlie Lowrey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Alex, it's Charlie. I'll take that. Thanks for the question."", ""We have said that we've always wanted -- that we want to be good stewards of capital. And as a result, we want to have a consistent disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses, as you said, and to shareholders. And there are really three aspects to our approach on which we focus. First and foremost is maintaining our rock-solid balance sheet and financial strength, which is critical to fulfilling the promises we make to our customers and clients."", ""Second is investing both organically and through programmatic acquisitions to support sustainable long-term growth of our businesses. And the third is returning excess capital to shareholders as we have in the past. And in this quarter, we've done all three. We've deployed capital to support strong sales across our businesses, including several new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers."", ""We closed on the Deerpath acquisition for PGIM, and we returned over $700 million to shareholders. So we'll continue to have this consistent and disciplined approach as we go forward."", 'Alex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'The second question I had is on PGIM flows. I was hoping you could just provide a little more color on what you expect going into 2024 as some of these headwinds begin to abate that have driven some outflows.', 'Andy Sullivan -- Head of International Businesses', ""Yes. Alex, it's Andy. Thanks for your question. We're not satisfied with the recent flows performance of the business, and we have been, and we're going to continue to take the appropriate actions to restore that performance to historical norms."", ""That really starts with ensuring that we have a range of strategies and vehicles so that we can broadly serve our customers. You've seen us continue to intentionally invest into the business to accomplish just that. So we've continued our expansion into private alternatives with the acquisitions of Montana Capital Partners and Deerpath. You've also seen us launch new vehicles like exchange-traded funds and ESG strategies."", ""All that work adds to an already broad and diversified portfolio. The second thing I would tell you is flows and active management are correlated with investment performance. And our performance strengthened throughout all of 2023, but flows can lag. So that's one of the reasons we're constructive on the outlook looking forward."", ""Third, we've continued -- we've not taken our foot off the gas on investing in distribution, because those three things, product breadth, investment results and distribution lead to active flows over the longer term. Let me also add that like others, I'm sure you're hearing, we believe that the record money market assets that are sitting on the sideline will flow back into fixed income once inflation and rates are stabilized and the rate trajectory, people are more confident in it. We're ready to capitalize on that given the strength of our investment performance with 81% of our assets outperforming benchmark over 5 and 10 years. So clearly not satisfied about the recent flow performance, but optimistic looking forward."", ""I would just end by noting we saw a pickup in gross inflows toward the end of 4Q, and that has continued into this year. So we're optimistic."", 'Alex Scott -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.', 'Elyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Hi. Thanks. My first question is on, I guess, sticking with PGIM. In the slides, you still call out -- you call out programmatic M&A there.', 'Can you just provide an update just on the pipeline of transactions and what you might be thinking about there?', 'Andy Sullivan -- Head of International Businesses', ""So thanks, Elyse. It's Andy. So I won't get obviously specific around pipeline, but maybe just bring it up a level. We've demonstrated our strong ability to grow PGIM organically over a long period of time."", ""So we certainly don't look at it as we need M&A to grow. That said, we do remain interested in augmenting our organic growth with mergers and acquisitions. Montana Capital Partners, PGIM Custom Harvest, and then obviously, our closure of Deerpath in December, those are great examples of us adding capabilities in higher growth, higher fee areas of the industry. So as we look forward, we're going to continue to look to globalize the business, and we're going to focus on higher growth, higher fee areas, so areas like private alternatives and real asset capabilities."", ""Clearly, periods of time like this that are disruptive can lead to opportunities, so we're making sure that we're in the know and in the flow on what's going on. We've also seen an uptick in activity in the marketplace. But as always, we're going to remain patient and disciplined in our approach."", 'Elyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""And then my second one is on the RBC. So it's now greater than 425%, right? And you guys saw a nice lift in the quarter. Would you look to maintain PICA RBC ratio around this level? Or is that something that you would maybe manage down over time and look to bring more capital to parent?"", 'Ken Tanji -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Elyse. It's Ken. We're well within our AA financial objectives on an RBC basis. Now it's not the only thing that matters for our credit rating."", ""But on that measure, we're where we need to be, and we have flexibility. So we -- again, we'll balance maintaining financial strength, which is obviously important to our value proposition growth and also distribution to shareholders. So we're balancing all 3 of those objectives."", 'Elyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live.', 'Suneet Kamath -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Thanks. Good morning. First of all, thank you to Ken for all of your help over the years. I really appreciate it.', ""My first question is just on the SGUL deal with Somerset Re. If I remember correctly, that was supposed to close in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we haven't seen an announcement on that yet, so maybe just an update there. And are you still expecting $450 million of proceeds when that deal closes?"", 'Rob Falzon -- Vice Chairman', ""Suneet, it's Rob. Yes, the deal continues to proceed toward closing. Our counterparty has actually received its regulatory approval. We've got one or two final steps on our end, but we expect a closing in this quarter."", ""Just a couple of reminders. One is, recall it is retrospective to the beginning of the year, so 1/1/24. And with respect to the financial impacts, annual earnings as well as onetime closing costs and capital, we'll update that in an announcement once we close."", 'Suneet Kamath -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then I guess on PGIM, totally appreciate the strong 5- and 10-year numbers, but it looks like the three-year number, 63% outperforming is a little bit lower. Is that something that we should -- that could have an impact on kind of the flow dynamics? Or is there something maybe that will drop off? Or -- I just want to get some color on how you're thinking about that three-year number."", 'Andy Sullivan -- Head of International Businesses', ""Yes, Suneet, I would focus on how much our investment performance has strengthened here in the near term. We did have a period of time -- we're an active manager. We have many high-conviction strategies designed to produce alpha. We went through a brief period in '21, '22, where we did see a dip in performance specifically in our fixed-income business, but that performance has strengthened quite nicely and is very, very strong right now."", ""So we don't expect that to have a major impact on us looking forward."", 'Suneet Kamath -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.', 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Hey. Good morning. So first, a question for Charlie, maybe on capital and just capital deployment overall. Can you talk about what your priorities are and where do -- and how do you think about M&A and/or share buybacks? Because it seems like you certainly have the capacity to do more in buybacks given your capital generation than you've been doing, but not sure if you're prioritizing other things instead as well."", 'Charlie Lowrey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. As I mentioned to Alex earlier, we do -- we have a consistent and balanced approach. And as a result, Jimmy, we really look for, again, the three things. One is to make sure that we have a very strong balance sheet, which we do, as Ken was talking about.', ""The second is to invest organically in our businesses, and you've seen us do that, and we will continue to do that to support sales growth to support the growth of all our businesses as we go forward. And then to look for acquisitions that make sense. Those would be in higher growth areas. It could be in distribution, it could be in geography as well."", ""We also see tremendous opportunities right now in the marketplace, in places like PRT, right, where we are one of the leaders in this business. We think there's going to be tremendous volume there. And that's really good business for us as we go forward. And Caroline, you may want to talk about that in one moment."", ""The final thing, as we've talked about, is returning excess capital to shareholders. We've done that in the past. And if we think we have excess capital, we'll do so. But we're going to evaluate that relative to our investment in our businesses and the opportunities that come along."", 'And Caroline, you might want to talk about one in particular.', 'Caroline Feeney -- Head of U.S. Businesses', 'Yes, absolutely. So, Jimmy, we did finish another strong year in pension risk transfer. We closed 11 transactions worth almost $6 billion finishing as the No. 2 pension risk transfer writer.', ""And we've already built on that positive momentum this year with a $5 billion deal with Shell. It's our largest first-quarter pension risk transfer ever. And with this win, Prudential now has completed seven of the top 10 U.S. PRT transactions on record."", ""We also see that strong sales trend continuing. It's driven by healthy pipelines due to favorable funding positions of over 100%. And last year's market volume was roughly $45 billion, and we do expect to see that healthy pipeline continue this year. And although the market is highly competitive with more new entrants, very few competitors have executed transactions exceeding $1 billion."", 'And while transactions will continue to be episodic in our PRT business our expertise and our ability to handle large complex transactions and our leadership position in service delivery, we believe, will position us well to remain a leader in the market.', 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. And then just in Latin America, can you share what your views are in terms of potential pension reform in the Chilean market, and what the reasonable case or sort of a worst-case impact would be on Prudential's business there?"", 'Andy Sullivan -- Head of International Businesses', ""Yes. So, Jimmy, it's Andy. Thank you for your question. As we've talked about before, our priority is always delivering for our customers day in and day out."", ""We're very leaned into what's in their best interest. As you would expect, because of that, we believe in being very proactive on advocating on their behalf. We're going to continue to advocate for reforms that improve the pension outcomes in Latin America and specifically for the citizens of Chile. Just to give you an update, in Chile, the constitutional referendum was rejected on December 17th, but after two failed attempts."", ""So President Boric really has moved on and is now focused squarely on pension reform. And there is a proposal that's advancing through Congress. That bill proposes to eliminate AFPs and to increase employer contributions to 6%. We're closely monitoring that situation as the passage would impact our Habitat JV."", ""But I would say just a couple of things. Our Habitat JV is a high-quality, very well-run business. It's been working to actively diversify across countries and into voluntary savings offerings. And if you take a step back, just recognize that joint venture, while it's obviously a larger component of our emerging markets, it's not a material contributor to PFI earnings."", ""So we'll obviously stay very close to it, and we'll let you know when we have any more clarity."", 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Your next question is coming from Joel Hurwitz from Dowling and Partners. Your line is now live.', 'Joel Hurwitz -- Dowling and Partners -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning. So I know lapses have periodically been an issue in Japan just given the exchange rates. It looks like there was a pretty sizable quarter-over-quarter reduction in the in-force amount in both international businesses in the quarter.', 'Can you just talk about what you saw in terms of lapsation there?', 'Andy Sullivan -- Head of International Businesses', ""Yes. So thanks, Joel, it's Andy. So let me just talk about the decline in the in-force. First, as I always start, we're exceptionally proud of our Japanese businesses."", ""They've been very consistent and stable contributors to Prudential for a very long time. With that, there are a few factors, though, that are impacting the life insurance in-force amounts. First, this is important to note, a significant portion of our recent sales are investment contracts, and that really reflects what customers are looking to buy. Those sales do not include a material life component, but are contributing to our earnings."", ""Second, we are seeing natural runoff in the older life blocks, particularly in the legacy yen business in Gibraltar. And then as we've talked about in previous quarters, with the recent yen depreciation, we've seen a modestly elevated level of surrenders. But all that said, we are confident in our ability to grow and diversify our Japanese businesses across insurance, investment, and retirement security. And we're continuing to invest in them."", 'Joel Hurwitz -- Dowling and Partners -- Analyst', 'OK. Helpful. And then switching gears to Group. So you reduced the benefit ratio target there.', ""Can you just talk about the overall drivers to the reduction there? And then what's the growth outlook for that business? It looks like top line for full year was roughly flat. Just any color on growth expectations there."", 'Caroline Feeney -- Head of U.S. Businesses', ""Yes, absolutely, Joel. It's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. So first of all, I'll start off by saying we had another very strong quarter for Group insurance and we're very pleased with the full year results of this business."", ""And we believe we're in that strong position in group given the progress we've made in executing on our strategy. And our future earnings power will reflect the efforts we've made to grow in a disciplined and profitable manner. We continue to focus on diversifying our business by expanding in the under 5,000 live market and the association segments. We're adding new products like supplemental health and continuing our growth in disability."", 'And we made progress in that diversification effort, increasing our disability premiums and fees at a higher rate than before. And our supplemental health premiums also grew at strong double-digit annual growth rates. And this diversification is driving stronger core earnings with higher margins. So as for our performance, our full-year benefits ratio was just over 83 percentage points.', ""It includes very strong performance in our Life block in the second and third quarters of last year and record disability results in the first half of the year. While we don't expect that record performance to continue indefinitely, there are certainly other factors to consider. So overall, Joel, I'd say that our Group business is growing. It's doing so at attractive margins with COVID having transitioned to an endemic state, combined with our diversification strategy I just walked you through as well as investments we've made in improving our claims management capabilities and strategic partnerships, we believe we'll see that underwriting performance and earnings power continue to improve."", 'And that is why we are confident with our decision in lowering our benefits ratio guidance to be 83% to 87% for the year. And in terms of just future earnings power as well, I gave you some color there as well, Joel. We believe the future earnings power of Group Insurance will continue to be strong as we continue to grow and execute on our strategy.', 'Joel Hurwitz -- Dowling and Partners -- Analyst', 'Very helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is now live.', 'Wilma Burdis -- Raymond James -- Analyst', ""Hey. Good morning. I'm just wondering if there's been any activity with Prismic. Seeing that you guys have been focused on the sales of fixed annuity and also with this large PRT deal."", 'So if could give us an update there, please.', 'Rob Falzon -- Vice Chairman', ""Wilma, it's Rob. So as we've articulated before, we're quite enthusiastic about Prismic and more broadly about what we see to be the opportunities that are coming out of the intersection between asset management and insurance and specifically the role that Prismic can play in helping us to execute against that opportunity. We believe it will create avenues of growth across our businesses, not specifically for the PRT transaction that we recently announced, but the opportunity to be a source of financing for sales growth, both in the retirement marketplace and our other businesses on a go-forward basis. Our investors, which are extremely large global institutional investors share our aspirations, both from a directional standpoint and from a quantum standpoint."", ""So our expectation is to go well beyond the initial $10 billion structured securities or structured settlements transaction that we completed. It's going to include some level of ongoing balance sheet optimization. It's going to include, as I noted, financing the growth across our businesses. I think what's unique in a way about Prismic is the appetite by it and its investors for longer duration and more complex liabilities."", ""And we're also going to look to do third-party blocks as well in Prismic, all of which will enable the benefit of increasing the assets under management for our PGIM business."", 'Wilma Burdis -- Raymond James -- Analyst', ""And could you talk a little bit about the buyback. I think you guys said that the $1 billion authorization for 2024 -- certainly, with -- would you guys sell blocks and run off earnings a little bit? It's good to see more capital returns. So can you just talk about how you guys are thinking through that."", 'Ken Tanji -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. It's Ken. Yes, we've had a very consistent approach to shareholder distributions using both dividends and share repurchases as a way to return capital. Our share repurchases for this year was approved by the board, and they had considered our capital position, our outlook for free cash flow but also opportunities to deploy that capital into organic growth, as Charlie discussed, in particular, the very robust PRT market."", ""So all those things factored into it. We increased our dividend again. That's -- now we've increased that 16 years in a row. So again, it all factors into what we think is a very consistent approach, balancing all our objectives as well."", 'So I hope that color helps.', 'Wilma Burdis -- Raymond James -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.', 'John Barnidge -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity and best of luck, Ken. My first question, I appreciate -- if we could go to the Group Insurance business, I appreciate the benefit ratio guidance. But is there an expense savings story in disability coming up? I can't help but notice improvement in administrative expenses in recent quarters."", 'And with COVID moving endemic, the ramping up of expenses, should that fall to the side?', 'Caroline Feeney -- Head of U.S. Businesses', ""Yes. So, John, it's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. In terms of our overall expense management, you may have seen we saw 100 basis point improvement in our admin ratio from the year ago quarter."", 'That is driven by both business growth and continued expense discipline. And we will continue to focus on expense efficiencies and obviously then would regularly adjust our operating models to ensure the appropriate levels of service going forward. In terms of disability overall, I would say across group disability, results were driven by our focus on effective claims management, including those short- and long-term disability as well as absence in family leave. We also benefited from the continued tailwinds of strong employment and a high-interest rate environment, and our disability business had an outstanding year.', ""I would also just want to point out something else strategically, we're doing on the disability side as we continue to grow that area. We've actually invested, John, in improving our claims management process through a strategic partnership with EvolutionIQ. This is a provider of AI-driven technology that provides real-time monitoring leading to increased recoveries. So overall, I'd say in terms of expense management, we remain highly disciplined and also, obviously, very much focused in terms of our pricing discipline."", ""The evidence there is our ability to accomplish all this growth in maintaining our price competitiveness. But the fact that as we continue to grow our book, we're also not afraid to walk away if the pricing just doesn't make sense on any particular case. So overall, we remain confident in our decision to lower benefit ratio guidance and feel very comfortable with our expense management and our pricing discipline."", 'John Barnidge -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""Thank you for that answer. My follow-up question, when you talk about globalizing the PGIM business, are there markets you're not large in size that you want to get bigger in? Where does Prismic sit within that growth opportunity for PGIM internationally?"", 'Andy Sullivan -- Head of International Businesses', ""So John, I'll start out, and then, Rob, if you want to tail in, you can jump in. So when we talk about globalizing the business, I think it's important to recognize that a majority of our assets under management today are in the United States. So we've been actively, for many years now, working to expand across Europe and Asia and have invested quite heavily in distribution on both the institutional and retail side of the business. That said, as we look to continue to broaden and diversify our mix of both asset classes, but geographies, we would look to Europe and Asia as key geographies that we're most interested in growing."", 'Rob Falzon -- Vice Chairman', ""John, it's Rob. Just following up on Andy. Within Asia and with respect to Prismic, I think what I'd note is we see a huge opportunity in Japan, both with regard to, as Ken alluded to earlier in the call, optimizing our own book, but also with respect to the sort of opportunities we see with third parties in that marketplace as well."", 'John Barnidge -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Appreciate that. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is now live.', 'Mike Ward -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Thanks guys. Good morning. Sorry to be the one to ask. Just curious if there's any update on commercial real estate side for you guys."", ""It looked like the LTV deteriorated a little bit. Just kind of wondering how you feel about any kind of watch list or resolutions that you've made last year, too."", 'Rob Falzon -- Vice Chairman', ""This is Rob. So I'll take your question, Mike. So a couple of thoughts. One, from an overall market standpoint, let me start there."", ""From a peak to trough, what we've seen is across the market, about a 16% correction, and that number relates to what I'll call, institutional quality real estate, the sort of things that we invest in or we lend against. And that's on an unlevered basis. Our estimate is that the peak to trough in this cycle across real estate types is going to probably be a little over 20%. So we've got 5% or 6% probably left in the way of price correction yet to experience."", ""Now within that, office, obviously, has corrected much more severely, closer to 30% to date, and probably has another 10%, 15% yet to go. Because the construction of our portfolio, it's significantly underweight, office and because of the overall quality of the portfolio and the diversification of it across geography and property types. And importantly, because this is a portfolio that's directly originated by PGIM with a team that's deep and averages some 25 years of industry experience, we're actually finding that our portfolio is holding up quite well. So loan to values across the portfolio were about 58% and our discount -- our debt service coverage ratios remain right around 2.5%."", ""Within our overall portfolio, our actual valuations increased about 6% during the course of 2023 despite the fact that we saw a double-digit decline in the office component of our portfolio. But again, because that office component is only 2% of our assets or 50% -- about 14% of our mortgages, the performance of the rest of the portfolio has offset that. So with regard to portfolio performance, we're actually feeling quite good. The last thing that you asked about was sort of what we're seeing in watch list, etc."", ""I guess the way I would describe that, Mike, is that the first -- if we look at our experience with maturities during 2023, we had about $2 billion worth of scheduled maturities. Of those, we provided modifications for four -- less than $400 million of that $2 billion with those modifications providing longer-term extensions. The remainder of all of those maturities was resolved favorably through refinancing payoffs or short-term extensions that then led or are leading to subsequent payoffs. In the upcoming year 2024, we've got about $3 billion of maturities coming on."", ""That's about 6% of the portfolio that's maturing. And while we don't expect to be immune from this cycle by any means, we do expect that on a relative basis, we'll be quite resilient. We increased our reserves in the real estate portfolio to around $370 million as of the end of the year and that represents about 72 basis points, and we think that that's well provisioned against the portfolio, again, given what we've experienced in the underlying quality of that portfolio."", 'Mike Ward -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Awesome. Really helpful. Thanks, Rob.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments."", 'Charlie Lowrey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'So thank you again for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped a year of continued growth and evolution for Prudential. Our strategy, coupled with our mutually reinforcing business system positions us well to deliver long-term sustainable growth to all our stakeholders. Our fundamentals are strong, and we are confident about our momentum going into 2024.', 'We will continue to lead the way in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security across the globe as we seek to help current and future generations build a secure financial future.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share, indicating a change of -16.3% from the year-ago quarter.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Oracle:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.13 = US$15b ÷ (US$134b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2023).', ""Thus, Oracle has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Software industry average of 7.7% it's much better."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Oracle ', ""In the above chart we have measured Oracle's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""There hasn't been much to report for Oracle's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Oracle to be a multi-bagger going forward."", ""In summary, Oracle isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 148% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high."", ""On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Oracle  that we think you should be aware of."", ""While Oracle isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Our first quarter earnings will be released on May 1 with a conference call on the same day. Finally, please mark your calendars for an in-person Taco Bell Consumer Day in December at the Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, California. Stay tuned for more details and invitations to follow. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs."", 'David W. Gibbs', ""Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our results, I want to express our continued concern for those impacted by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our franchisees and employees in the region. Turning to 2023. It was a remarkable year for Yum! Brands as we crossed the $60 billion system sales threshold and exceeded all aspects of our long-term growth algorithm. Despite facing numerous challenges around the world, our incredible teams delivered another exceptional year of growth across our business. We set an industry development record for the third straight year. We made massive strides in scaling our proprietary digital and AI-driven ecosystem. And we continued to build the talent base that I believe is the best in the industry. We delivered 6% unit growth, 10% system sales growth and 12% core operating profit growth. We enter 2024 having opened just shy of 10,000 net new restaurants over the past 3 years and are well on our way to reaching 60,000 restaurants this year. This growth would not be possible were not for our world-class franchise partners, who continue to deploy their own capital based on their confidence to invest behind the long-term potential of our brand. Along with the record-breaking success we've had on development, our digital strategy has helped to propel top line results and improve bottom line profits. Digital sales approached $30 billion in 2023, up 22% year-over-year with mix now exceeding 45%. At the same time, we have accelerated the deployment of our proprietary technologies to optimize back-of-house operations and make it easier to run our restaurants. In doing so, we are equipping our franchise partners with distinctive capabilities that differentiate them from the competition, especially in emerging markets. I'll now share some more details on the fourth quarter specifically. During the quarter, top line sales were impacted by the conflict in the Middle East region with varying degrees of impact across markets in the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. This represented a low single-digit headwind to Yum!'s overall fourth quarter same-store sales growth. This trend has continued into the first quarter, and we expect the sales impact to decrease over the course of 2024. Key to our growth is the performance of our twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., which account for approximately 70% of Yum!'s system sales and roughly 80% of Yum!'s division operating profit. In 2023, KFC International opened nearly 2,700 new restaurants, reaching 10% growth with restaurants opened across 96 countries. More than 80% of unit growth came from our 15 publicly traded franchisees. Entering 2024, I have strong confidence in the durability of KFC's global expansion for which we continue to see an incremental 50,000 restaurant opportunity over the long term. On a global basis, Taco Bell crossed the $15 billion system sales milestone this year, reflecting the growing scale of this powerhouse brand. Turning to Taco Bell U.S., which contributes more than 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit, the brand maintained its 2-year same-store sales trend in the fourth quarter, outperforming the QSR industry. Taco Bell continued to deliver industry-leading margins at 24% this year while at the same time, leading the QSR industry in several key value perception indicators. Now I'll discuss our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short, followed by our Unrivaled Culture & Talent and Good Growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our fourth quarter results and balance sheet position, followed by our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability. Starting with the KFC division, which accounts for 50% of our divisional operating profit and will soon cross this incredible milestone of 30,000 units. For the year, system sales grew 12% with 8% unit growth and 7% same-store sales growth. For the quarter, KFC achieved 7% system sales growth owing to 8% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. KFC China grew system sales by an impressive 20% during the quarter. We had several other standout markets this quarter, including 16% system sales growth in Latin America and 13% system sales growth in both Africa and Thailand. In Latin America, we targeted new consumers and dayparts using compelling value offers, and we expanded our KFC Original nuggets. In Africa, the team boosted its breakfast daypart with new beverages, including signature coffees at a great price. The Thailand market saw strong transaction growth driven by smart value offerings across all dayparts. At KFC U.S., same-store sales were flat this quarter with trends on a 2-year basis remaining consistent from the prior quarter. In Q1, the team has planned a range of exciting initiatives, including the Smash'd Potato Bowl, the first bowl innovation since 2019, and the rollout of KFC's first loyalty rewards program. Moving on to Taco Bell division, which represents 36% of our divisional operating profit. At Taco Bell U.S., fourth quarter same-store sales grew 3% and 15% on a 2-year basis, outperforming the QSR industry by 3 points. Taco Bell U.S. faced tough laps early in the quarter but finished the year strong with comps up over 5% in the final period. The quarter included a record digital sales mix, which reached 31%, up 7 points year-over-year. Growth in kiosk sales was a large driver with in-store kiosk sales mix increasing 15 points from Q4 last year. Optimizing our digital channels is also contributing to growth in Taco Bell's loyalty program with active loyalty users growing 17% in 2023. The team plans to bring exciting enhancements to the loyalty program in the second half of 2024 to capitalize on digital engagement and provide an easier experience for customers to earn and redeem points. While not surprising, I'm always proud to see our incredible Taco Bell team's efforts being recognized with Entrepreneur magazine naming the brand the #1 franchisor for the fourth year running and with Nation's Restaurant News crowning Taco Bell the 2023 Brand Icon. With an unprecedented range of exciting innovations launching this year, including at least one new product every 5 weeks, twice the rate of 2023, I'm confident Taco Bell will remain a brand icon for years to come. At Taco Bell International, we delivered 14% unit growth this year. The majority of this growth was contributed by our big 4 scaled markets, including Spain, which opened 19 new units this year and is on track to reach 150 units in Q1. As we enter 2024, we will work with our franchise partners in these markets to build brand and category awareness with Mexican food, particularly in Europe and Asia, leaning into fan favorites and expanding protein offerings. Additionally, we are working on scaling and entering new markets that will enable a broader base from which to grow. Next, at the Pizza Hut division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit and will soon eclipse 20,000 units. In Q4, system sales grew 1% with 4% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. For the full year, system sales grew 5%, including 4% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. At Pizza Hut International, same-store sales were flat for the quarter. The team continues to roll out Melts across the globe to build the individual eater occasion. Strength in the aggregator channel continues to be a bright spot across several markets, including Canada and Latin America. Buy one, get one deals coupled with aggregator promotions drove transaction growth in Canada during the quarter. In Latin America, the promotion of our own digital channels in Brazil, combined with a New York-style pizza, helped boost sales for that market. At Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 4% for the quarter while growing 1% for the full year. The Melts launch and the promotion of the Detroit-style pizza in the prior year contributed to a difficult lap this quarter. Pizza Hut U.S. will face another challenging lap in Q1 as same-store sales increased 8% last year, reflecting full quarter of sales from the Melts platform and the Big New Yorker. However, we expect performance trends on a 2-year basis to improve in the first quarter. In Q1, the team will launch two limited-time offers, including Hot Honey Pizza and Wings, a perfect pairing for fans to enjoy in the run-up to the Super Bowl. In the months ahead, the team will be announcing some exciting innovations to the Melts platform. Lastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, for the full year, system sales grew 6%, led by 8% unit growth. Reflecting on 2023, Habit's new leadership team focused on improving all elements of Habit's operations, including expediting a robust kiosk rollout, implementing a sales-driven labor optimization model and harnessing Yum!'s co-op purchasing group to lower procurement costs and rationalize SKUs. As a result of these efforts, the team achieved a 380 basis point increase in full year store-level margins despite softness in sales. Now I'll turn to our Good Growth strategy, starting with our People pillar. We take great pride in developing our talent and ensuring we have a strong bench to drive performance. And we were thrilled to be recognized in TIME Magazine's inaugural list of the Best Companies for Future Leaders with Yum! ranking an impressive 32nd among U.S. companies. The strength of our talent is evident through Sean Tresvant's official transition to Taco Bell Division CEO on January 1. Sean joined Yum! in 2022 and is a visionary business leader with a proven track record of driving transformative brand-building through his previous role as the Taco Bell Global Chief Brand and Strategy Officer. I'd like to again congratulate Sean as he takes the helm at Taco Bell. And I'm confident he and the rest of the team will continue to successfully deliver the brand's long-term global growth strategy. I'd also be remiss if we didn't take another opportunity to recognize Mark King for everything he did as Taco Bell Division CEO to set the brand up for future success, including handpicking Sean as his successor and ensuring that Taco Bell would be in more-than-capable hands. On behalf of the entire Yum! system, I want to thank Mark for his people-first leadership that drove strong results, inspired restless creativity and solidified Taco Bell's unique brand identity that makes it an undisputed global icon. Additionally, Pizza Hut Global Chief Technology Officer, Joe Park, will be moving into the Yum! Chief Digital and Technology Officer role currently held by Clay Johnson, who will continue as a senior adviser. I want to thank Clay for his incredible leadership joining Yum! in 2019, including developing our digital and technology capabilities from the ground-up and establishing Yum! as a clear leader in technology in global QSR. Since joining Yum!, Joe formed our first-ever long-range innovation team before moving on to Pizza Hut, our most digital brand, where he partnered with our global operations and technology leaders to deliver new levels of ease to our customers and improved unit economics for our franchisees. I'm confident he is the perfect person to lead us into the next chapter on our digital and technology journey. Moving on to the Planet pillar of our Good Growth strategy. In 2023, we remained focused on efforts under our priority areas of greenhouse gas reduction and sustainable packaging. We've made progress on our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 through investments in renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our restaurants and through ongoing commitments with our food suppliers. In terms of packaging, we are increasing our global use of more widely recyclable plastics in our consumer packaging. And we continue to remove plastic packaging in the form of bags and cutlery in addition to eliminating styrofoam. Our continued progress in sustainability has been underscored by several recent recognitions, including being named to the 2024 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the eighth consecutive year and being listed by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2024. Before I wrap, I want to pay tribute to our incredible partners at Yum China. In December, my team and I traveled to Shanghai to meet with CEO Joey Wat and her executive team. That trip reinforced our view that Yum China is without question the world's most capable restaurant operator. They enable rapid growth and structural cost efficiencies through their dynamic development capabilities and their robust in-house supply chain. Our team sampled amazing new menu items in their innovation kitchen. And we saw firsthand the digital capabilities that enable Yum China to engage with an astounding 470 million members in its loyalty program. These advantages enable consistent paybacks of 2 to 3 years in KFC and Pizza Hut despite evolving market conditions, a further testament to their clear competitive advantages in the market. As I look back over the last year, the unique advantages of our diversified system shone through. While the business faced persistent inflation across the globe and navigated shifts in consumer sentiment stemming from regional conflicts, we responded with a focused determination to execute our growth plan, including growing units in 110 countries, meaningfully scaling our technology systems, deepening collaboration across our brands and delivering both sales and profits well above our long-term growth algorithm. We're confident 2024 will be another banner year with a number of exciting sales-driving opportunities, such as enhancing the range of protein offerings at Taco Bell, expanding new category entry points and significantly boosting the impact of our loyalty program. With a world-class team, globally iconic brands, industry-leading franchisees and a relentless appetite for growth, the future is brighter than ever. And I am confident that we will continue to maximize value for our shareholders. With that, Chris, over to you."", 'Christopher Lee Turner', ""Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. As David mentioned, 2023 was an exceptional year with Yum! exceeding all components of our long-term growth algorithm. Full year same-store sales grew a very robust 6%. We opened 4,754 gross new units, the equivalent of 13 restaurants a day or 1 restaurant roughly every 2 hours. KFC set a brand development record, opening over 2,700 new units across 97 different countries. I also want to extend congratulations to the Yum China team, who crossed 10,000 KFC restaurants this quarter with nearly 40% of those restaurants built in the last 3 years. Turning to our results. Full year system sales grew 10% with fourth quarter system sales up 5%, led by 6% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Yum!'s twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., grew system sales 12% this year. Fourth quarter ex special general and administrative expenses were $344 million, down 4% year-over-year due to strict cost control. Reported G&A was $353 million for the quarter, including $9 million in special expense related to an ongoing resource optimization project. For the full year, ex special general and administrative expenses were $1.17 billion. Core operating profit grew 8% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. Reported operating profit included a negligible impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation and a $49 million headwind for the full year. Our ex special tax rate was 26% in the quarter and slightly under 21% for the full year. Fourth quarter ex special EPS was $1.26, a decline year-over-year, stemming from a $0.23 headwind from fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate that drove our effective tax rate above our guided range in 2023 and below our guided range in 2022. Full year ex special EPS was $5.17, a 14% increase year-over-year. Now let me share some greater detail on our fourth quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. Yum! opened just shy of 1,900 units in the fourth quarter with approximately 87% of that growth coming from our international markets. The KFC division was the largest driver, finishing the year with units up 8%. China, India, Thailand, South Africa and Spain drove KFC's development this year and were part of a group of 15 countries that grew unit count by more than 25 restaurants. In December, we were pleased to announce that we signed an agreement to acquire 218 KFC restaurants from our largest franchisee in the U.K. This is an exciting opportunity for us to purchase restaurants with average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store-level cash margins in a market where we have an exceptional local management team who run our existing KFC U.K. equity store base. We expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchise rights, which will be reflected in store-level margins post acquisition. We anticipate this transaction to close during the second quarter. At Pizza Hut, the division opened 575 units for the quarter and nearly 1,600 units for the year, a record for the brand. There were 73 markets that contributed to the brand's development. China, India, Turkey, Japan and Canada led Pizza Hut's growth internationally with more than 900 units opened across those countries. The Taco Bell division opened 201 units in Q4 and 417 units for the full year. In the U.S., unit development was also on fire with 244 gross new units. Our longer-term growth engines that include Habit and Taco Bell International opened 208 units on a combined basis and grew unit count by 12%. We finished 2023 with unit growth occurring in 110 countries. We now have units in 293 brand country combinations, providing an unmatched level of diversity geographically as well as in consumer preference with leading brands in the chicken, pizza and Mexican categories. Looking ahead, we expect development in 2024 to continue at a robust pace. In the first half, KFC will reach an incredible 30,000 units and Pizza Hut will top 20,000 units. At KFC, we enter 2024 with more development commitments than last year. We recently returned from an inspiring visit to China in December and were reminded of the incredible runway for KFC's growth in the market, where Yum China has over 10,000 KFC restaurants yet serves only 1/3 of the population. Taco Bell International will continue to expand their footprint, though the growth rate will temporarily slow as the brand looks to stabilize same-store sales performance in emerging markets and partner with franchisees to optimize site selection, leveraging KFC and Pizza Hut market-mapping data. Moving on to our Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth driver, which I'll speak to through the lens of our digital strategy involving our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights pillars. 2023 was a landmark year for successfully scaling our suite of proprietary technologies across our global restaurant base. Beginning with our Easy Experiences pillar. We have successfully deployed our Yum! Commerce Platform to KFC U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. and are continuing to onboard the Pizza Hut U.S. system. Looking ahead, we will start to deploy this platform to two Pizza Hut International markets in the first half of 2024. Kiosks remain an important priority in delivering a consistent customer experience, driving ticket uplift and streamlining our restaurant operations. Globally, we've increased our kiosk penetration in KFC restaurants by 70% over the past year outside of China. We ended the year with kiosks in approximately 500 KFC U.S. restaurants, a huge step-up from nearly 0 only 2 quarters before. Our KFC Latin America markets also began the rollout of kiosks using our proprietary Tictuk platform this year and plan to triple the restaurant count in 2024. Within Easy Operations, this quarter, we continued to fire on all cylinders, significantly expanding the rollout of our world-class technology products and platforms. Poseidon, our proprietary point-of-sale system, which was expanded to an additional 1,700 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, resulting in 5,000 restaurants having been onboarded this year. We also ramped up the deployment of our Dragontail AI platform with an additional 1,000 locations onboarded this quarter and over 4,000 new restaurants added for the full year. We now have Dragontail in place in nearly 7,000 restaurants across Pizza Hut and KFC. Our 2024 rollout will include launching Dragontail in nearly 6,000 more restaurants, further evidence of our ability to scale software globally at a rapid pace. Our AI-driven Automated Inventory Management system is now being used in 90% of our KFC U.S. locations and roughly half of our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, driving more seamless and more accurate inventory ordering processes for our restaurant managers. More than 3,000 additional restaurants across KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut will be onboarded to the Automated Inventory Management system in 2024. Finally, our custom-built Super App, which provides smart automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in over 8,500 Pizza Hut restaurants globally. And KFC has plans to roll this out to approximately 6,000 restaurants in 2024. For the third pillar of our Easy strategy, Easy Insights, we are fully leveraging our unique global scale to bring new insights and enable even smarter and quicker decision-making. This year, we expanded the reach of our Yum! global data hub, which captures the vast majority of global transaction-level sales data and other key operational and customer metrics. In 2024, our Easy Insights team will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that pull from the global data hub and integrate into our own technology platforms, including personalized upsell recommendations for customers ordering on our digital platforms, intelligent menu pricing recommendations and dynamic restaurant routines for general managers. Stepping back, it's incredibly encouraging to see this digital ecosystem come to life in our restaurants. By the end of 2024, we are likely to have our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants operating substantially all of these key technologies through the Yum! ecosystem, from the Poseidon point-of-sale system to the Yum! Commerce Platform, our Automated Inventory Management software and the [tracks] restaurant management application, truly a power brand powered by world-class technology. Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 4.2x, down from 5x last year. As we had previously shared, we had planned for our net leverage ratio to drift lower during 2023 based on pausing new debt financing, paying our $279 million revolver balance in Q1 and retiring a $325 million bond maturity in Q4. Our capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $103 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $225 million, reflecting $60 million in refranchising proceeds and $285 million in gross CapEx. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares totaling $50 million. With the November bond maturity behind us and no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we will return to using our excess free cash flow to fund the share repurchases and any accretive investments we choose to make, for example, the U.K. KFC acquisition. In addition, we were pleased to recently announce an 11% increase to the dividend. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash. Finally, let me shed some light on how 2024 is shaping up. Despite a more challenging operating environment, including the impact of the conflict in the Middle East, we expect to deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. This includes core operating profit growth to be at least 8%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. We have a strong unit development pipeline, thanks to attractive and reliable paybacks and growth-minded franchisees, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong system sales growth. For the shape of the year, we expect top line trends in Q1 to be the most challenged with same-store sales trends improving sequentially as laps cease and a range of sales-driving initiatives take hold. We expect full year Taco Bell company operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. We anticipate flat ex special G&A growth as we manage spend across the organization. Remember that G&A can vary due to the nature of our performance-based compensation plan. Lastly, we expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%. To close, I am incredibly proud of our performance this year. Sales trends became a little more challenging in the second half and yet we delivered profit growth above our algorithm as our teams quickly adjusted marketing calendars to meet demand and kept a strict focus on managing costs. It is our teams' relentless focus to stay vigilant on all areas of the business that gives me confidence we will deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. The unbeatable combination of our iconic brands, best-in-class franchisees and resilient business model will enable us to deliver growth and shareholder value creation for years to come. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Gregory Francfort of Guggenheim.', 'Gregory Ryan Francfort', ""I mean, the question I had, as we look into 2024, there's obviously been some pockets of weakness around the world. But in terms of your development, you touched a little bit in the first half on some of the milestones you're going to reach. But what do you think about the pace of development globally in 2024 and 2025? Do you expect that to kind of hold around this 6% range? Or any thoughts there would be helpful."", 'David W. Gibbs', ""Yes. Thank you for the question, Gregory. Obviously, in our prepared remarks, and I'll reiterate in my comments now, we are very confident in the pace of development. The pipeline has never looked better for us. Obviously, it varies country-by-country, but franchisees are getting great returns. You've heard yesterday, Yum China commit to continued strong growth and the great returns they're getting through development. Even Pizza Hut U.S. is picking up the pace of development. We see lots of reasons to be hopeful. And we have a lot of good visibility into the pipeline, the development agreements that we've struck with franchisees. And the way we're evolving our asset types, I think, is another tailwind for us on development. I think we mentioned when we were in China, we've seen this new model that they've come up with, the satellite Pizza Hut delco store, which they -- we believe they can blow out and be a real growth driver for them is just one example."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.', 'Brian John Bittner', ""As it relates to 2024, Chris, you said you expect it to be a year that you're going to perform in line with your algorithm, of course, meaning that you can grow your operating profits at least 8%, excluding the extra week. I just want to dive a little more into this and your confidence around it. I know unit growth is a source of confidence. Clearly, you've outlined that on today's call. But what about the same-store sales required to get to that algorithm, just given the ongoing headwinds from the Middle East, a potentially more challenging U.S. environment? How do you think about what's required from a same-store sales perspective after the first quarter as it relates to the need for them to accelerate?"", 'Christopher Lee Turner', ""Yes. Thanks, Brian. If we talk about the algorithm this year and our confidence in delivering it, I'll start by reiterating our primary growth driver, which David just talked about on development, obviously, one of our strongest pipelines in recent years, lots of reasons to be excited about development continuing at or above that 5% in the algorithm. We talked about from a same-store sales standpoint, we expect sequential improvement through the year. Our two primary growth drivers, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., continue to have strong positions in their markets around the globe. Obviously, we've got the Middle East headwind that we mentioned that we'll deal with. But we expect sequential improvement throughout the year. And so we're confident in the trajectory on that piece. But then you get to the 8% -- at least 8% core operating profit growth, which is really what the algorithm is intended to drive. And that's where we've got even more levers at our disposal. So we mentioned that we expect flat G&A year-over-year, which reflects how we're managing that component of the P&L. And so we've got confidence in the actions that we're taking there. There's a component of that around our digital and technology approach. As our capabilities become more and more mature, we get more and more leverage out of those capabilities. And of course, we're doing all of that in service of our franchisees, where we're building leading-edge capabilities at the lowest cost for them and we've invested ahead. But we also mentioned the productivity programs that we continue to drive, which in the past few years have been used to fund those incremental investments in D&T, but we're going to continue to drive those productivity improvements. And then finally, we're lapping some larger-than-normal incentive programs that will help from a G&A standpoint as well. So you add it all up, we're very confident in delivering that at least 8% core operating profit growth in our algorithm."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore.', 'David Sterling Palmer', ""Lots of great stuff on this call. I don't know if this is going to be something you can answer this call, but maybe something for the future. Your digital sales growth and mix increased very strong, a 22% growth this quarter, you said. And I just wonder how incremental you think that growth is to sales or other benefits that you see in terms of loyalty and even labor efficiency. So I know we would all be very open to hearing how incremental that is, obviously a quarter like this when you have a lot of headwinds and noise, but maybe for a future call even if you don't have that handy. But another separate question, maybe easier to answer, you talked about the 2-year trend accelerating for Pizza Hut U.S. in the first quarter. And even if we were to say that, that was a couple of points of acceleration on a 2-year, that could imply flat comps starting in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. I'm wondering if you think that, that sort of stabilization in comps is a reasonable expectation for Pizza Hut starting in the second quarter."", 'Christopher Lee Turner', ""Yes. Thanks so much. I'll start with digital. So yes, look, our digital capabilities continue to drive actually all elements of our algorithm. They support strong unit economics. As you heard, we continue to expand the Easy Operations capabilities, which make our restaurants easier for our team members to operate and it helps our franchisees drive productivity. And so that is helping us ensure that our franchisees continue to have strong unit economics, which allows them to invest in building new stores. If you look at that 10% global system sales growth for the full year, we think digital played a big part of that, both on the unit side and on the same-store sales side. And then as I said from a profitability standpoint for Yum!, as those capabilities continue to mature, we can get more and more leverage out of the -- our digital and technology teams and capabilities in-house. And so that's part of us bending the curve on those investments that I mentioned in our G&A plan for the year. So again, we're very pleased with the progress on the digital front, and we still have a lot of that journey ahead of us. We described big plans this year to continue to accelerate the rollout."", 'David W. Gibbs', ""Yes, I'll talk about pizza. But on the digital front, one thing I really want to emphasize is just the talent we've been able to attract to the digital space, both at Yum! and at the brands, is unbelievable. We are becoming a talent magnet in digital. It's a great place to work. We're investing behind this. Our franchisees are quickly adopting it. And even though we're at $30 billion of sales and growing fast, we're still in the early innings of what this can do to the business and the way it can transform us. So we could not be more excited about digital. And we will continue to report on the various metrics, loyalty and things like that, as we go forward and keep you guys informed on the journey. On Pizza Hut, yes, obviously, sometimes we forget when you look at 1-year numbers without really looking at the full picture, Q1 for Pizza Hut U.S., we have an enormous lap. And obviously, I have to take that into account as we launched Melts last year very successfully and are now rolling that around the world. But we certainly are planned for Pizza Hut U.S. to be positive for the year. The team has a number of things planned for the calendar as we go forward. And we love the fact that Pizza Hut globally hit a new record on net new unit development and is becoming a bigger contributor to that part of our growth. And certainly, Yum China last night talked a lot about the great success and the wide runway they have for Pizza Hut in that market."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Citi.', 'Jon Michael Tower', ""A quick clarification and a question. On the G&A guidance for '24, is that just on a dollar basis? Can you maybe just level set us where that -- what your expectation is? Is it flat on a 52-week basis? Or obviously, you've got an extra week in some of the divisions. And then the question itself is more along the lines of how franchisees -- how you're working with the franchisees to approach pricing in 2024, I guess, more focused on the U.S. there, given that, that's the market where I think there's some incremental pressure on the lower-income consumer. But how are you guiding them to think about it, given some of the pressures on labor that are going to be manifesting themselves throughout the year?"", 'Christopher Lee Turner', 'Yes. So the G&A, we ended the year ex special at $1.17 billion. We expect to be flat on that in the 52 weeks. So it should be an apples-to-apples comparison on that commentary around flat.', 'David W. Gibbs', ""Yes. And as far as the U.S. consumer and pricing, just some good news to share there at least from a Yum! perspective. As we think about the U.S. consumer, the best way for us to look at it is obviously through the lens of our Taco Bell business, which is the vast majority of our U.S. sales and profits. Throughout 2024, we saw a slight outperformance from our restaurants that were in low -- 2023, the restaurants that were in low-income trade areas versus the rest of the business. So with the low-income consumer, I know there's been a lot of talk about are they dropping out. Certainly, for Taco Bell, that actually looks -- it looks like we're doing a great job of holding on to them. And in fact, in both the entire year and in Q4, we saw the low-income consumer trade areas outperform the rest of the business. And I think that speaks to the strength of Taco Bell in this environment. It is a value leader in so many ways. When you talk to consumers about value, they win on every value perception score. And they can do value with innovation, which is also a great combination. And they can do value while having industry-leading margins. So you think about the room that we have to compete with everybody else in the category, I really, really like our position with Taco Bell. Obviously, as we move into Q1, we've got tougher laps. U.S. weather really played havoc on sales early in the quarter. And as we've said, it's going to be the lowest quarter of the year. But we think this environment is one that obviously we can thrive in the U.S. And there will be less pricing to the point of your question, but it's not going to slow Taco Bell down in terms of being able to connect with consumers and grow transactions."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.', 'Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein', ""Just following up on that, you did talk about a more challenging macro into '24. And I assume that's above and beyond the Middle East. So specific to the U.S., again just any change in behavior you're seeing in any of your three core brands, consumer trading around the menu? Specifically, I know that from television advertising, each of your three big brands has what appears to be a pretty compelling value offer. So I'm just wondering how those value offers are performing, the consumer demand for them, maybe the mix shift of value today, however you define that, versus where it's been in years past? Any color on that would be great."", 'David W. Gibbs', ""Sure. Yes, just to build on my comments about the Taco Bell business in the U.S. and how it's set up to thrive in this environment, the value menu that we've recently tweaked in the U.S. to be $3 and under is actually over-indexing a little bit with consumers versus test and expectations, which isn't a bad thing because it's a real competitive advantage for us. And it's designed to maintain franchisee profitability. So there may be some small shifts in consumer behaviors. But as I said on previous calls, we just are slowly returning to a more normal operating environment, where value is always important in the category as is convenience and food innovation capability. And we think we just win on all those fronts with Taco Bell and why we're excited about 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird.', 'David E. Tarantino', ""I just wanted to come back to your comp outlook for the year. And I know you mentioned several times some of the reasons you expect things to maybe get better as the year goes on. But I'm hoping that you could maybe elaborate on your view there, whether you think it's the macro getting better or you think it's more what you have in your initiative pipeline. And then I guess, the second part of the question would be if that doesn't materialize the way that you anticipate, do you have levers to pull to still deliver the profit growth that you're expecting for the year?"", 'David W. Gibbs', ""Well, in terms of the comp outlook, obviously, the Middle East creates some uncertainty for the environment. And Chris just talked about one of the levers that we have to pull, which is improving our efficiency and holding G&A flat year-over-year. But the bigger picture is we're really excited about the initiatives that each of the brands has going. Just to give you a glimpse, Taco Bell in 2024 is going to have twice the innovation on the calendar that they had in 2023. And I've obviously seen a lot of this innovation and excited about the impact it's going to have with consumers. I mentioned the fact that in the U.S., it's a brand that thrives in a value environment. But around the world, just to give you some more color on Q4, we have positive transaction growth in Q4 despite the impact of the Middle East -- that the Middle East had on our overall business. So we think the year sets up where, obviously, the Middle East is a big variable. But putting that aside, we think the year sets up to be another great year for Yum! all around the world with sales growth. And a lot of it is driven by us leaning in more on what we call category entry points opening up new lines of business for us. So I'm excited in a couple of days to head to South Africa to see the great work that, that team is doing in terms of launching breakfast and the beverage work that they're doing that's really having a positive impact on their sales. But we've got stories like that going on all around the world."", 'Christopher Lee Turner', ""And then David, as you mentioned, we do have multiple levers to ensure that we land the ultimate component of the algorithm, which is at least 8% core operating profit growth. We've talked about the flat G&A plan, and we also referenced in the comments some of the productivity projects that we have going on. So we're laser-focused on that component as well and have plenty of levers we can pull."", 'Operator', 'Our final question today comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS.', 'Dennis Geiger', ""Just another on Taco Bell, I guess, David, in light of the strength in the multiyear trends in December and then the initiatives that you highlight, I guess, is it fair for Taco Bell, given the fact that you're seeing pretty good strength across consumers for the brand plus the initiatives, that you could see sort of a widening market share or traffic share outperformance gap at Taco Bell this year, given the environment and given the plans you have in place, if anything to share on that?"", 'David W. Gibbs', ""Yes, thank you, Dennis. Yes, so look, Taco Bell in Q4, just to put a little bit more numbers around it, put up a 2-year number of a plus 15%. Again, going back to -- sometimes we forget what we were lapping. We were lapping massive Mexican pizza performance. They were able to lap that and grow on that. And in a challenging consumer environment, we think that favors them. And absolutely, what you said is absolutely true. We're constantly looking to gain market share. And the Taco Bell business has been doing that for now for many years, and we think this is an environment that favors them. So I couldn't be more excited about the growth that Taco Bell has ahead of it in the U.S., and we've really just begun with that brand. And I'm excited about Sean and the team we've got in place to lead that. I'll wrap up by one of my fun facts that -- we get hit with so many of them as we're preparing for these calls. But if you're not aware, in the last 3 years, 25% of all Yum! restaurants have been built. Now you're talking about brands that have been 50 to 70 years and older. But yet in the last 3 years, nearly 25% of our restaurants were built in the last 3 years. It gives you a sense for, first of all, how the condition of our asset base around the world and how new it feels, given the age of the brands, but also the commitment that our franchisees have to this business. They're investing their capital and building those stores. And we always talk about net new units, that's gross new units. A lot of those stores replaced the stores that had reached the end of their useful life. So it shows their commitment to the next 20, 30 years of the brand, and they have been fantastic partners. They've always been our competitive advantage. We're seeing that even just managing through the Middle East and how Americana has done such a good job of that. And we couldn't be more excited, given the development pipeline, the commitment that our franchisees have and the strength of our brands as we head into 2024. Thank you for your time today."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.""]"

Before I discuss our results, I want to express our continued concern for those impacted by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our franchisees and employees in the region. Turning to 2023.', 'It was a remarkable year for Yum! Brands as we crossed the $60 billion system sales threshold and exceeded all aspects of our long-term growth algorithm. Despite facing numerous challenges around the world, our incredible teams delivered another exceptional year of growth across our business. We set an industry development record for the third straight year. We made massive strides in scaling our proprietary digital and AI-driven ecosystem.', 'And we continued to build the talent base that I believe is the best in the industry. We delivered 6% unit growth, 10% system sales growth, and 12% core operating profit growth. We enter 2024 having opened just shy of 10,000 net new restaurants over the past three years and are well on our way to reaching 60,000 restaurants this year. This growth would not be possible were not for our world-class franchise partners, who continue to deploy their own capital based on their confidence to invest behind the long-term potential of our brand.', ""Along with the record-breaking success we've had on development, our digital strategy has helped to propel top-line results and improve bottom-line profits. Digital sales approached $30 billion in 2023, up 22% year over year with mix now exceeding 45%. At the same time, we have accelerated the deployment of our proprietary technologies to optimize back-of-house operations and make it easier to run our restaurants. In doing so, we are equipping our franchise partners with distinctive capabilities that differentiate them from the competition, especially in emerging markets."", ""I'll now share some more details on the fourth quarter specifically. During the quarter, top-line sales were impacted by the conflict in the Middle East region with varying degrees of impact across markets in the Middle East, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This represented a low single-digit headwind to Yum!'s overall fourth-quarter same-store sales growth. This trend has continued into the first quarter, and we expect the sales impact to decrease over the course of 2024."", ""Key to our growth is the performance of our twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., which account for approximately 70% of Yum!'s system sales and roughly 80% of Yum!'s division operating profit. In 2023, KFC International opened nearly 2,700 new restaurants, reaching 10% growth with restaurants opened across 96 countries. More than 80% of unit growth came from our 15 publicly traded franchisees. Entering 2024, I have strong confidence in the durability of KFC's global expansion for which we continue to see an incremental 50,000 restaurant opportunity over the long term."", 'On a global basis, Taco Bell crossed the $15 billion system sales milestone this year, reflecting the growing scale of this powerhouse brand. Turning to Taco Bell U.S., which contributes more than 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit, the brand maintained its two-year same-store sales trend in the fourth quarter, outperforming the QSR industry. Taco Bell continued to deliver industry-leading margins at 24% this year while at the same time, leading the QSR industry in several key value perception indicators.', ""Now I'll discuss our Relevant, Easy, and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short, followed by our Unrivaled Culture & Talent and Good Growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our fourth-quarter results and balance sheet position, followed by our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability. Starting with the KFC division, which accounts for 50% of our divisional operating profit and will soon cross this incredible milestone of 30,000 units."", 'For the year, system sales grew 12% with 8% unit growth and 7% same-store sales growth. For the quarter, KFC achieved 7% system sales growth owing to 8% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. KFC China grew system sales by an impressive 20% during the quarter.', 'We had several other standout markets this quarter, including 16% system sales growth in Latin America and 13% system sales growth in both Africa and Thailand. In Latin America, we targeted new consumers and dayparts using compelling value offers, and we expanded our KFC Original nuggets. In Africa, the team boosted its breakfast daypart with new beverages, including signature coffees at a great price. The Thailand market saw strong transaction growth driven by smart value offerings across all dayparts.', ""At KFC U.S., same-store sales were flat this quarter with trends on a two-year basis remaining consistent from the prior quarter. In Q1, the team has planned a range of exciting initiatives, including the Smash'd Potato Bowl, the first bowl innovation since 2019, and the rollout of KFC's first loyalty rewards program. Moving on to Taco Bell division, which represents 36% of our divisional operating profit. At Taco Bell U.S., fourth-quarter same-store sales grew 3% and 15% on a two-year basis, outperforming the QSR industry by 3 points."", 'Taco Bell U.S. faced tough laps early in the quarter but finished the year strong with comps up over 5% in the final period. The quarter included a record digital sales mix, which reached 31%, up 7 points year over year. Growth in kiosk sales was a large driver with in-store kiosk sales mix increasing 15 points from Q4 last year.', ""Optimizing our digital channels is also contributing to growth in Taco Bell's loyalty program with active loyalty users growing 17% in 2023. The team plans to bring exciting enhancements to the loyalty program in the second half of 2024 to capitalize on digital engagement and provide an easier experience for customers to earn and redeem points. While not surprising, I'm always proud to see our incredible Taco Bell team's efforts being recognized with Entrepreneur magazine naming the brand the No. 1 franchisor for the fourth year running and with Nation's Restaurant News crowning Taco Bell the 2023 Brand Icon."", ""With an unprecedented range of exciting innovations launching this year, including at least one new product every five weeks, twice the rate of 2023, I'm confident Taco Bell will remain a brand icon for years to come. At Taco Bell International, we delivered 14% unit growth this year. The majority of this growth was contributed by our big four scaled markets, including Spain, which opened 19 new units this year and is on track to reach 150 units in Q1. As we enter 2024, we will work with our franchise partners in these markets to build brand and category awareness with Mexican food, particularly in Europe and Asia, leaning into fan favorites and expanding protein offerings."", 'Additionally, we are working on scaling and entering new markets that will enable a broader base from which to grow. Next, at the Pizza Hut division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit and will soon eclipse 20,000 units. In Q4, system sales grew 1% with 4% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East.', 'For the full year, system sales grew 5%, including 4% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. At Pizza Hut International, same-store sales were flat for the quarter. The team continues to roll out Melts across the globe to build the individual eater occasion. Strength in the aggregator channel continues to be a bright spot across several markets, including Canada and Latin America.', 'Buy one, get one deals coupled with aggregator promotions drove transaction growth in Canada during the quarter. In Latin America, the promotion of our own digital channels in Brazil, combined with a New York-style pizza, helped boost sales for that market. At Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 4% for the quarter while growing 1% for the full year. The Melts launch and the promotion of the Detroit-style pizza in the prior year contributed to a difficult lap this quarter.', 'Pizza Hut U.S. will face another challenging lap in Q1 as same-store sales increased 8% last year, reflecting full quarter of sales from the Melts platform and the Big New Yorker. However, we expect performance trends on a two-year basis to improve in the first quarter. In Q1, the team will launch two limited-time offers, including Hot Honey Pizza and Wings, a perfect pairing for fans to enjoy in the run-up to the Super Bowl.', ""In the months ahead, the team will be announcing some exciting innovations to the Melts platform. Lastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, for the full year, system sales grew 6%, led by 8% unit growth. Reflecting on 2023, Habit's new leadership team focused on improving all elements of Habit's operations, including expediting a robust kiosk rollout, implementing a sales-driven labor optimization model, and harnessing Yum!'s co-op purchasing group to lower procurement costs and rationalize SKUs. As a result of these efforts, the team achieved a 380 basis point increase in full-year store-level margins despite softness in sales."", ""Now I'll turn to our Good Growth strategy, starting with our People pillar. We take great pride in developing our talent and ensuring we have a strong bench to drive performance. And we were thrilled to be recognized in TIME Magazine's inaugural list of the Best Companies for Future Leaders with Yum! ranking an impressive 32nd among U.S. companies."", ""The strength of our talent is evident through Sean Tresvant's official transition to Taco Bell Division CEO on January 1st. Sean joined Yum! in 2022 and is a visionary business leader with a proven track record of driving transformative brand-building through his previous role as the Taco Bell Global Chief Brand and Strategy Officer. I'd like to again congratulate Sean as he takes the helm at Taco Bell. And I'm confident he and the rest of the team will continue to successfully deliver the brand's long-term global growth strategy."", ""I'd also be remiss if we didn't take another opportunity to recognize Mark King for everything he did as Taco Bell Division CEO to set the brand up for future success, including handpicking Sean as his successor and ensuring that Taco Bell would be in more-than-capable hands. On behalf of the entire Yum! system, I want to thank Mark for his people-first leadership that drove strong results, inspired restless creativity, and solidified Taco Bell's unique brand identity that makes it an undisputed global icon. Additionally, Pizza Hut global chief technology officer, Joe Park, will be moving into the Yum! chief digital and technology officer role currently held by Clay Johnson, who will continue as a senior advisor. I want to thank Clay for his incredible leadership joining Yum! in 2019, including developing our digital and technology capabilities from the ground up and establishing Yum! as a clear leader in technology in global QSR."", ""Since joining Yum!, Joe formed our first-ever long-range innovation team before moving on to Pizza Hut, our most digital brand, where he partnered with our global operations and technology leaders to deliver new levels of ease to our customers and improved unit economics for our franchisees. I'm confident he is the perfect person to lead us into the next chapter on our digital and technology journey. Moving on to the Planet pillar of our Good Growth strategy. In 2023, we remained focused on efforts under our priority areas of greenhouse gas reduction and sustainable packaging."", ""We've made progress on our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 through investments in renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our restaurants and through ongoing commitments with our food suppliers. In terms of packaging, we are increasing our global use of more widely recyclable plastics in our consumer packaging. And we continue to remove plastic packaging in the form of bags and cutlery in addition to eliminating styrofoam. Our continued progress in sustainability has been underscored by several recent recognitions, including being named to the 2024 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the eighth consecutive year and being listed by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2024."", ""Before I wrap, I want to pay tribute to our incredible partners at Yum China. In December, my team and I traveled to Shanghai to meet with CEO Joey Wat and her executive team. That trip reinforced our view that Yum China is without question the world's most capable restaurant operator. They enable rapid growth and structural cost efficiencies through their dynamic development capabilities and their robust in-house supply chain."", 'Our team sampled amazing new menu items in their innovation kitchen. And we saw firsthand the digital capabilities that enable Yum China to engage with an astounding 470 million members in its loyalty program. These advantages enable consistent paybacks of two to three years in KFC and Pizza Hut despite evolving market conditions, a further testament to their clear competitive advantages in the market. As I look back over the last year, the unique advantages of our diversified system shone through.', ""While the business faced persistent inflation across the globe and navigated shifts in consumer sentiment stemming from regional conflicts, we responded with a focused determination to execute our growth plan, including growing units in 110 countries, meaningfully scaling our technology systems, deepening collaboration across our brands and delivering both sales and profits well above our long-term growth algorithm. We're confident 2024 will be another banner year with a number of exciting sales-driving opportunities, such as enhancing the range of protein offerings at Taco Bell, expanding new category entry points, and significantly boosting the impact of our loyalty program. With a world-class team, globally iconic brands, industry-leading franchisees, and a relentless appetite for growth, the future is brighter than ever. And I am confident that we will continue to maximize value for our shareholders."", 'With that, Chris, over to you.', 'Chris Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development, and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. As David mentioned, 2023 was an exceptional year with Yum! exceeding all components of our long-term growth algorithm. Full-year same-store sales grew a very robust 6%."", 'We opened 4,754 gross new units, the equivalent of 13 restaurants a day or one restaurant roughly every two hours. KFC set a brand development record, opening over 2,700 new units across 97 different countries. I also want to extend congratulations to the Yum China team, who crossed 10,000 KFC restaurants this quarter with nearly 40% of those restaurants built in the last three years. Turning to our results.', ""Full-year system sales grew 10% with fourth-quarter system sales up 5%, led by 6% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Yum!'s twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., grew system sales 12% this year. Fourth-quarter ex-special general and administrative expenses were $344 million, down 4% year over year due to strict cost control. Reported G&A was $353 million for the quarter, including $9 million in special expense related to an ongoing resource optimization project."", 'For the full year, ex-special general and administrative expenses were $1.17 billion. Core operating profit grew 8% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. Reported operating profit included a negligible impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation and a $49 million headwind for the full year. Our ex-special tax rate was 26% in the quarter and slightly under 21% for the full year.', 'Fourth-quarter ex-special EPS was $1.26, a decline year over year, stemming from a $0.23 headwind from fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate that drove our effective tax rate above our guided range in 2023 and below our guided range in 2022. Full-year ex-special EPS was $5.17, a 14% increase year over year. Now let me share some greater detail on our fourth-quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. Yum! opened just shy of 1,900 units in the fourth quarter with approximately 87% of that growth coming from our international markets.', ""The KFC division was the largest driver, finishing the year with units up 8%. China, India, Thailand, South Africa, and Spain drove KFC's development this year and were part of a group of 15 countries that grew unit count by more than 25 restaurants. In December, we were pleased to announce that we signed an agreement to acquire 218 KFC restaurants from our largest franchisee in the U.K. This is an exciting opportunity for us to purchase restaurants with average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store-level cash margins in a market where we have an exceptional local management team who run our existing KFC U.K."", 'equity store base. We expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchise rights, which will be reflected in store-level margins post acquisition. We anticipate this transaction to close during the second quarter. At Pizza Hut, the division opened 575 units for the quarter and nearly 1,600 units for the year, a record for the brand.', ""There were 73 markets that contributed to the brand's development. China, India, Turkey, Japan, and Canada led Pizza Hut's growth internationally with more than 900 units opened across those countries. The Taco Bell division opened 201 units in Q4 and 417 units for the full year. In the U.S., unit development was also on fire with 244 gross new units."", 'Our longer-term growth engines that include Habit and Taco Bell International opened 208 units on a combined basis and grew unit count by 12%. We finished 2023 with unit growth occurring in 110 countries. We now have units in 293 brand country combinations, providing an unmatched level of diversity geographically as well as in consumer preference with leading brands in the chicken, pizza, and Mexican categories. Looking ahead, we expect development in 2024 to continue at a robust pace.', ""In the first half, KFC will reach an incredible 30,000 units and Pizza Hut will top 20,000 units. At KFC, we enter 2024 with more development commitments than last year. We recently returned from an inspiring visit to China in December and were reminded of the incredible runway for KFC's growth in the market, where Yum China has over 10,000 KFC restaurants yet serves only one-third of the population. Taco Bell International will continue to expand their footprint, though the growth rate will temporarily slow as the brand looks to stabilize same-store sales performance in emerging markets and partner with franchisees to optimize site selection, leveraging KFC and Pizza Hut market-mapping data."", ""Moving on to our Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth driver, which I'll speak to through the lens of our digital strategy involving our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations, and Easy Insights pillars. 2023 was a landmark year for successfully scaling our suite of proprietary technologies across our global restaurant base. Beginning with our Easy Experiences pillar. We have successfully deployed our Yum! Commerce Platform to KFC U.S."", 'and Taco Bell U.S. and are continuing to onboard the Pizza Hut U.S. system. Looking ahead, we will start to deploy this platform to two Pizza Hut International markets in the first half of 2024.', ""Kiosks remain an important priority in delivering a consistent customer experience, driving ticket uplift, and streamlining our restaurant operations. Globally, we've increased our kiosk penetration in KFC restaurants by 70% over the past year outside of China. We ended the year with kiosks in approximately 500 KFC U.S. restaurants, a huge step up from nearly zero only two quarters before."", 'Our KFC Latin America markets also began the rollout of kiosks using our proprietary Tictuk platform this year and plan to triple the restaurant count in 2024. Within Easy Operations, this quarter, we continued to fire on all cylinders, significantly expanding the rollout of our world-class technology products and platforms. Poseidon, our proprietary point-of-sale system, which was expanded to an additional 1,700 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, resulting in 5,000 restaurants having been onboarded this year.', 'We also ramped up the deployment of our Dragontail AI platform with an additional 1,000 locations onboarded this quarter and over 4,000 new restaurants added for the full year. We now have Dragontail in place in nearly 7,000 restaurants across Pizza Hut and KFC. Our 2024 rollout will include launching Dragontail in nearly 6,000 more restaurants, further evidence of our ability to scale software globally at a rapid pace. Our AI-driven Automated Inventory Management system is now being used in 90% of our KFC U.S.', 'locations and roughly half of our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, driving more seamless and more accurate inventory ordering processes for our restaurant managers. More than 3,000 additional restaurants across KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut will be onboarded to the Automated Inventory Management system in 2024. Finally, our custom-built Super App, which provides smart automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in over 8,500 Pizza Hut restaurants globally.', 'And KFC has plans to roll this out to approximately 6,000 restaurants in 2024. For the third pillar of our Easy strategy, Easy Insights, we are fully leveraging our unique global scale to bring new insights and enable even smarter and quicker decision-making. This year, we expanded the reach of our Yum! global data hub, which captures the vast majority of global transaction-level sales data and other key operational and customer metrics. In 2024, our Easy Insights team will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that pull from the global data hub and integrate into our own technology platforms, including personalized upsell recommendations for customers ordering on our digital platforms, intelligent menu pricing recommendations, and dynamic restaurant routines for general managers.', ""Stepping back, it's incredibly encouraging to see this digital ecosystem come to life in our restaurants. By the end of 2024, we are likely to have our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants operating substantially all of these key technologies through the Yum! ecosystem, from the Poseidon point-of-sale system to the Yum! Commerce Platform, our Automated Inventory Management software, and the tracks restaurant management application, truly a power brand powered by world-class technology. Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position."", 'Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 4.2 times, down from five times last year. As we had previously shared, we had planned for our net leverage ratio to drift lower during 2023 based on pausing new debt financing, paying our $279 million revolver balance in Q1, and retiring a $325 million bond maturity in Q4. Our capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $103 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $225 million, reflecting $60 million in refranchising proceeds and $285 million in gross capex.', 'For the full year, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares totaling $50 million. With the November bond maturity behind us and no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we will return to using our excess free cash flow to fund the share repurchases and any accretive investments we choose to make, for example, the U.K. KFC acquisition. In addition, we were pleased to recently announce an 11% increase to the dividend.', 'I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend, and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash. Finally, let me shed some light on how 2024 is shaping up. Despite a more challenging operating environment, including the impact of the conflict in the Middle East, we expect to deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024.', 'This includes core operating profit growth to be at least 8%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. We have a strong unit development pipeline, thanks to attractive and reliable paybacks and growth-minded franchisees, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong system sales growth. For the shape of the year, we expect top-line trends in Q1 to be the most challenged with same-store sales trends improving sequentially as laps cease and a range of sales-driving initiatives take hold. We expect full-year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%.', 'We anticipate flat ex-special G&A growth as we manage spend across the organization. Remember that G&A can vary due to the nature of our performance-based compensation plan. Lastly, we expect our full-year tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%. To close, I am incredibly proud of our performance this year.', ""Sales trends became a little more challenging in the second half and yet we delivered profit growth above our algorithm as our teams quickly adjusted marketing calendars to meet demand and kept a strict focus on managing costs. It is our teams' relentless focus to stay vigilant on all areas of the business that gives me confidence we will deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. The unbeatable combination of our iconic brands, best-in-class franchisees, and resilient business model will enable us to deliver growth and shareholder value creation for years to come. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Gregory Francfort of Guggenheim. Gregory, your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'Gregory Francfort -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst', ""Hey. Thanks for the question. I mean, the question I had, as we look into 2024, there's obviously been some pockets of weakness around the world. But in terms of your development, you touched a little bit in the first half on some of the milestones you're going to reach."", 'But what do you think about the pace of development globally in 2024 and 2025? Do you expect that to kind of hold around this 6% range? Or any thoughts there would be helpful.', 'David Gibbs -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thank you for the question, Gregory. Obviously, in our prepared remarks, and I'll reiterate in my comments now, we are very confident in the pace of development. The pipeline has never looked better for us."", ""Obviously, it varies country by country, but franchisees are getting great returns. You've heard yesterday, Yum China commit to continued strong growth and the great returns they're getting through development. Even Pizza Hut U.S. is picking up the pace of development."", ""We see lots of reasons to be hopeful. And we have a lot of good visibility into the pipeline, the development agreements that we've struck with franchisees. And the way we're evolving our asset types, I think, is another tailwind for us on development. I think we mentioned when we were in China, we've seen this new model that they've come up with, the satellite Pizza Hut delco store, which they -- we believe they can blow out and be a real growth driver for them is just one example."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.', 'Brian Bittner -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', ""As it relates to 2024, Chris, you said you expect it to be a year that you're going to perform in line with your algorithm, of course, meaning that you can grow your operating profits at least 8%, excluding the extra week. I just want to dive a little more into this and your confidence around it. I know unit growth is a source of confidence. Clearly, you've outlined that on today's call."", ""But what about the same-store sales required to get to that algorithm, just given the ongoing headwinds from the Middle East, a potentially more challenging U.S. environment? How do you think about what's required from a same-store sales perspective after the first quarter as it relates to the need for them to accelerate?"", 'Chris Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Thanks, Brian. If we talk about the algorithm this year and our confidence in delivering it, I'll start by reiterating our primary growth driver, which David just talked about on development, obviously, one of our strongest pipelines in recent years, lots of reasons to be excited about development continuing at or above that 5% in the algorithm. We talked about from a same-store sales standpoint, we expect sequential improvement through the year."", ""Our two primary growth drivers, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., continue to have strong positions in their markets around the globe. Obviously, we've got the Middle East headwind that we mentioned that we'll deal with. But we expect sequential improvement throughout the year. And so we're confident in the trajectory on that piece."", ""But then you get to the 8% -- at least 8% core operating profit growth, which is really what the algorithm is intended to drive. And that's where we've got even more levers at our disposal. So we mentioned that we expect flat G&A year over year, which reflects how we're managing that component of the P&L. And so we've got confidence in the actions that we're taking there."", ""There's a component of that around our digital and technology approach. As our capabilities become more and more mature, we get more and more leverage out of those capabilities. And of course, we're doing all of that in service of our franchisees, where we're building leading-edge capabilities at the lowest cost for them and we've invested ahead. But we also mentioned the productivity programs that we continue to drive, which in the past few years have been used to fund those incremental investments in D&T, but we're going to continue to drive those productivity improvements."", ""And then finally, we're lapping some larger-than-normal incentive programs that will help from a G&A standpoint as well. So you add it all up, we're very confident in delivering that at least 8% core operating profit growth in our algorithm."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore.', 'David Palmer -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Lots of great stuff on this call. I don't know if this is going to be something you can answer this call, but maybe something for the future. Your digital sales growth and mix increased very strong, a 22% growth this quarter, you said. And I just wonder how incremental you think that growth is to sales or other benefits that you see in terms of loyalty and even labor efficiency."", ""So I know we would all be very open to hearing how incremental that is, obviously a quarter like this when you have a lot of headwinds and noise, but maybe for a future call even if you don't have that handy. But another separate question, maybe easier to answer, you talked about the two-year trend accelerating for Pizza Hut U.S. in the first quarter. And even if we were to say that, that was a couple of points of acceleration on a two-year, that could imply flat comps starting in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis."", ""I'm wondering if you think that, that sort of stabilization in comps is a reasonable expectation for Pizza Hut starting in the second quarter."", 'Chris Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Thanks so much. I'll start with digital. So yes, look, our digital capabilities continue to drive actually all elements of our algorithm."", 'They support strong unit economics. As you heard, we continue to expand the Easy Operations capabilities, which make our restaurants easier for our team members to operate and it helps our franchisees drive productivity. And so that is helping us ensure that our franchisees continue to have strong unit economics, which allows them to invest in building new stores. If you look at that 10% global system sales growth for the full year, we think digital played a big part of that, both on the unit side and on the same-store sales side.', ""And then as I said from a profitability standpoint for Yum!, as those capabilities continue to mature, we can get more and more leverage out of the -- our digital and technology teams and capabilities in-house. And so that's part of us bending the curve on those investments that I mentioned in our G&A plan for the year. So again, we're very pleased with the progress on the digital front, and we still have a lot of that journey ahead of us. We described big plans this year to continue to accelerate the rollout."", 'David Gibbs -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, I'll talk about pizza. But on the digital front, one thing I really want to emphasize is just the talent we've been able to attract to the digital space, both at Yum! and at the brands, is unbelievable. We are becoming a talent magnet in digital. It's a great place to work."", ""We're investing behind this. Our franchisees are quickly adopting it. And even though we're at $30 billion of sales and growing fast, we're still in the early innings of what this can do to the business and the way it can transform us. So we could not be more excited about digital."", 'And we will continue to report on the various metrics, loyalty and things like that, as we go forward and keep you guys informed on the journey. On Pizza Hut, yes, obviously, sometimes we forget when you look at one-year numbers without really looking at the full picture, Q1 for Pizza Hut U.S., we have an enormous lap. And obviously, I have to take that into account as we launched Melts last year very successfully and are now rolling that around the world. But we certainly are planned for Pizza Hut U.S.', 'to be positive for the year. The team has a number of things planned for the calendar as we go forward. And we love the fact that Pizza Hut globally hit a new record on net new unit development and is becoming a bigger contributor to that part of our growth. And certainly, Yum China last night talked a lot about the great success and the wide runway they have for Pizza Hut in that market.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Citi.', 'Jon Tower -- Citi -- Analyst', ""A quick clarification and a question. On the G&A guidance for '24, is that just on a dollar basis? Can you maybe just level set us where that -- what your expectation is? Is it flat on a 52-week basis? Or obviously, you've got an extra week in some of the divisions. And then the question itself is more along the lines of how franchisees -- how you're working with the franchisees to approach pricing in 2024, I guess, more focused on the U.S. there, given that, that's the market where I think there's some incremental pressure on the lower-income consumer."", 'But how are you guiding them to think about it, given some of the pressures on labor that are going to be manifesting themselves throughout the year?', 'Chris Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yes. So the G&A, we ended the year ex special at $1.17 billion. We expect to be flat on that in the 52 weeks. So it should be an apples-to-apples comparison on that commentary around flat.', 'David Gibbs -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes. And as far as the U.S. consumer and pricing, just some good news to share there at least from a Yum! perspective. As we think about the U.S.', ""consumer, the best way for us to look at it is obviously through the lens of our Taco Bell business, which is the vast majority of our U.S. sales and profits. Throughout 2024, we saw a slight outperformance from our restaurants that were in low -- 2023, the restaurants that were in low-income trade areas versus the rest of the business. So with the low-income consumer, I know there's been a lot of talk about are they dropping out."", ""Certainly, for Taco Bell, that actually looks -- it looks like we're doing a great job of holding on to them. And in fact, in both the entire year and in Q4, we saw the low-income consumer trade areas outperform the rest of the business. And I think that speaks to the strength of Taco Bell in this environment. It is a value leader in so many ways."", 'When you talk to consumers about value, they win on every value perception score. And they can do value with innovation, which is also a great combination. And they can do value while having industry-leading margins. So you think about the room that we have to compete with everybody else in the category, I really, really like our position with Taco Bell.', ""Obviously, as we move into Q1, we've got tougher laps. U.S. weather really played havoc on sales early in the quarter. And as we've said, it's going to be the lowest quarter of the year."", ""But we think this environment is one that obviously we can thrive in the U.S. And there will be less pricing to the point of your question, but it's not going to slow Taco Bell down in terms of being able to connect with consumers and grow transactions."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.', 'Jeff Bernstein -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Just following up on that, you did talk about a more challenging macro into '24. And I assume that's above and beyond the Middle East. So specific to the U.S., again just any change in behavior you're seeing in any of your three core brands, consumer trading around the menu? Specifically, I know that from television advertising, each of your three big brands has what appears to be a pretty compelling value offer. So I'm just wondering how those value offers are performing, the consumer demand for them, maybe the mix shift of value today, however you define that, versus where it's been in years past? Any color on that would be great."", 'David Gibbs -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Yes, just to build on my comments about the Taco Bell business in the U.S. and how it's set up to thrive in this environment, the value menu that we've recently tweaked in the U.S. to be $3 and under is actually over-indexing a little bit with consumers versus test and expectations, which isn't a bad thing because it's a real competitive advantage for us."", ""And it's designed to maintain franchisee profitability. So there may be some small shifts in consumer behaviors. But as I said on previous calls, we just are slowly returning to a more normal operating environment, where value is always important in the category as is convenience and food innovation capability. And we think we just win on all those fronts with Taco Bell and why we're excited about 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird.', 'David Tarantino -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', ""I just wanted to come back to your comp outlook for the year. And I know you mentioned several times some of the reasons you expect things to maybe get better as the year goes on. But I'm hoping that you could maybe elaborate on your view there, whether you think it's the macro getting better or you think it's more what you have in your initiative pipeline. And then I guess, the second part of the question would be if that doesn't materialize the way that you anticipate, do you have levers to pull to still deliver the profit growth that you're expecting for the year?"", 'David Gibbs -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, in terms of the comp outlook, obviously, the Middle East creates some uncertainty for the environment. And Chris just talked about one of the levers that we have to pull, which is improving our efficiency and holding G&A flat year over year. But the bigger picture is we're really excited about the initiatives that each of the brands has going. Just to give you a glimpse, Taco Bell in 2024 is going to have twice the innovation on the calendar that they had in 2023."", ""And I've obviously seen a lot of this innovation and excited about the impact it's going to have with consumers. I mentioned the fact that in the U.S., it's a brand that thrives in a value environment. But around the world, just to give you some more color on Q4, we have positive transaction growth in Q4 despite the impact of the Middle East -- that the Middle East had on our overall business. So we think the year sets up where, obviously, the Middle East is a big variable."", ""But putting that aside, we think the year sets up to be another great year for Yum! all around the world with sales growth. And a lot of it is driven by us leaning in more on what we call category entry points opening up new lines of business for us. So I'm excited in a couple of days to head to South Africa to see the great work that, that team is doing in terms of launching breakfast and the beverage work that they're doing that's really having a positive impact on their sales. But we've got stories like that going on all around the world."", 'Chris Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""And then David, as you mentioned, we do have multiple levers to ensure that we land the ultimate component of the algorithm, which is at least 8% core operating profit growth. We've talked about the flat G&A plan, and we also referenced in the comments some of the productivity projects that we have going on. So we're laser-focused on that component as well and have plenty of levers we can pull."", 'Operator', 'Our final question today comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS.', 'Dennis Geiger -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Just another on Taco Bell, I guess, David, in light of the strength in the multiyear trends in December and then the initiatives that you highlight, I guess, is it fair for Taco Bell, given the fact that you're seeing pretty good strength across consumers for the brand plus the initiatives, that you could see sort of a widening market share or traffic share outperformance gap at Taco Bell this year, given the environment and given the plans you have in place, if anything to share on that?"", 'David Gibbs -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Thank you, Dennis. Yes, so look, Taco Bell in Q4, just to put a little bit more numbers around it, put up a two-year number of a plus 15%. Again, going back to -- sometimes we forget what we were lapping.', 'We were lapping massive Mexican pizza performance. They were able to lap that and grow on that. And in a challenging consumer environment, we think that favors them. And absolutely, what you said is absolutely true.', ""We're constantly looking to gain market share. And the Taco Bell business has been doing that for now for many years, and we think this is an environment that favors them. So I couldn't be more excited about the growth that Taco Bell has ahead of it in the U.S., and we've really just begun with that brand. And I'm excited about Sean and the team we've got in place to lead that."", ""I'll wrap up by one of my fun facts that -- we get hit with so many of them as we're preparing for these calls. But if you're not aware, in the last three years, 25% of all Yum! restaurants have been built. Now you're talking about brands that have been 50 to 70 years and older. But yet in the last three years, nearly 25% of our restaurants were built in the last three years."", ""It gives you a sense for, first of all, how the condition of our asset base around the world and how new it feels, given the age of the brands, but also the commitment that our franchisees have to this business. They're investing their capital and building those stores. And we always talk about net new units, that's gross new units. A lot of those stores replaced the stores that had reached the end of their useful life."", ""So it shows their commitment to the next 20, 30 years of the brand, and they have been fantastic partners. They've always been our competitive advantage. We're seeing that even just managing through the Middle East and how Americana has done such a good job of that. And we couldn't be more excited, given the development pipeline, the commitment that our franchisees have, and the strength of our brands as we head into 2024."", 'Thank you for your time today.', 'Operator', '[Operator signoff]', 'Duration: 0 minutes', 'Matt Morris -- Head of Investor Relations', 'David Gibbs -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Chris Turner -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Gregory Francfort -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst', 'Brian Bittner -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'David Palmer -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Jon Tower -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Jeff Bernstein -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'David Tarantino -- Robert W.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for McDonald's, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.24 = US$12b ÷ (US$56b - US$6.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Thus, McDonald's has an ROCE of 24%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.6% earned by companies in a similar industry."", "" Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's "", ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for McDonald's compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering McDonald's here  for free."", ""It's hard not to be impressed by McDonald's' returns on capital. The company has consistently earned 24% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 65% in that time. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 24%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If McDonald's can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future."", ""In short, we'd argue McDonald's has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further."", ""McDonald's does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for McDonald's  that you might be interested in."", 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, to which UPS belongs, has lost 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'UPS is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.7%.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Martin Marietta would post earnings of $6.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.94, delivering a surprise of +14.90%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$5.35b', 'US$5.84b', 'US$6.25b', 'US$5.12b', 'US$5.17b', 'US$5.00b', 'US$4.92b', 'US$4.90b', 'US$4.91b', 'US$4.96b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ -3.27%', 'Est @ -1.60%', 'Est @ -0.43%', 'Est @ 0.38%', 'Est @ 0.96%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% ', 'US$4.9k', 'US$5.0k', 'US$4.9k', 'US$3.7k', 'US$3.5k', 'US$3.1k', 'US$2.8k', 'US$2.6k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.2k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.326. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Occidental would post earnings of $0.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.18, delivering a surprise of +32.58%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Revenues of US$12b were in line with forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in below expectations at US$8.02, missing estimates by 6.3%. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern ', ""Following the latest results, Norfolk Southern's 21 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$12.5b in 2024. This would be a credible 3.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 51% to US$12.20. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$12.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$13.05 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the small dip in their earnings per share numbers for next year."", 'It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$246, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Norfolk Southern analyst has a price target of US$289 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$200. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.', ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Norfolk Southern'shistorical trends, as the 3.2% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 2.8% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 7.4% per year. So although Norfolk Southern is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's forecast to grow slower than the wider industry."", 'The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Norfolk Southern. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$246, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.', ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

PEP shares went on a strong run off the Covid lows and got off to a hot start in 2023.', 'The stock then dropped as more investors grew nervous about the growing use of weight loss drugs and the possible negative near-term and long-term impact they might have on PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and tons of other consumer staples brands, as well as the likes of McDonald’s (MCD).

Plus, PepsiCo’s results and outlook showcase that despite the success of weight loss drugs and some changing consumer habits, soda and snacks remain a booming business.', 'PEP’s sales are projected to jump 7% in FY23 and over 4% in FY24 to climb from $86.39 billion last year to $96.05 billion in 2024. PepsiCo’s expected expansion follows 9% sales growth last year and 13% higher revenue in FY21.

Valuation-wise PepsiCo trades at a 22% discount to its highs at 20.9X forward earnings and slightly below its 10-year median and KO despite its outperformance.', 'Bottom Line', 'Buying stocks right before earnings strictly to try to cash in on a big bounce is a risky proposition.

Creations seeks to not only create unique, limited-time flavors but also position Coca-Cola as a lifestyle brand through merchandise and virtual experiences.', 'The speed at which Spiced was created and rolled out was inspired by Creations, according to the company.', 'So far, the eight Creations items introduced include a dream-inspired flavor, another that is space-flavored and a third beverage created with the help of artificial intelligence.', 'The newest one,\xa0Happy Tears Zero Sugar,\xa0which debuts on Random Acts of Kindness Day on Feb. 17, is described by Coca-Cola as the first to be packaged in a “hype kit” that is available exclusively on TikTok. The kit comes with tissues to wipe away tears and other merchandise.', 'The soda draws on joyful moments like a teenager receiving a college acceptance letter or a friend sending a positive text. The cola carries a “splash of salty minerals” to emulate the taste of tears, according to a press release.', 'Oana Vlad, senior director of global strategy at Coca-Cola,\xa0said Tuesday that Creations engages young consumers about twice as much as other Coke trademark initiatives and almost all of them — more than 75%— are new to the Coke trademark. ', '“We are re-introducing the brand, in a way, to the next generation,” Vlad said.\xa0', 'Happy Tears Zero Sugar and Coca-Cola Spiced are just a few of the sodas that have or will be released in 2024.

Its sales are likely to have benefited from favorable price and sales mix, as well as brand and financial volume growth in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management indicated that it expects strong top-line growth in the quarters ahead, driven by the recovery in the U.S. beer category, stronger-than-expected brand volume growth and better-than-expected pricing across global markets, particularly Canada.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, today's event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir."", 'Dennis E. McDaniel', ""Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our year-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and, therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve."", 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We had strong operating performance in the fourth quarter and I'm happy to see that our hard work is reflected in the progress we are making. Net income rose $170 million to nearly $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year, including $18 million more benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities still held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was up 78% or $157 million versus a year ago. And on a full year basis, it was 42% higher than 2022. Our 87.5% fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 7.4 percentage points better than in 2022, with the catastrophe loss ratio representing 6.5 points of the improvement. That strong underwriting performance followed our recent pattern of improvement, resulting in a 94.9% full year 2023 combined ratio. That was 3.2 percentage points better than last year, including a decrease of 0.5 points in the catastrophe loss ratio. Our 2023 ex cat accident year combined ratios were also favorable compared with 2022, improving 2.1 percentage points to 85.7% for the fourth quarter and 1.8 points to 88.4% for the year. We saw positive momentum in many areas of operating performance. Growth for consolidated property casualty net written premiums accelerated, reaching 13% for the fourth quarter, including 10% for renewal premiums and 30% for new business premiums. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve performance and to counter the continuing effects and inflation on insured losses, we combined pricing segmentation by risk with average price increases and careful risk selection. Estimated average renewal price increases for the fourth quarter continued at a healthy pace. Our Commercial Lines insurance segment, again, averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our Excess and Surplus Lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal Lines for the fourth quarter included auto, continuing in the low double-digit range and homeowner continuing near the low end of the high single-digit range. Policy retention rates in 2023 were similar to 2022, with our Commercial Lines segment down slightly but still in the upper 80% range. In our Personal Lines segment, up slightly but still in the low to mid-90% range. Briefly reviewing operating performance by insurance segment, I'll focus on the full year results. Although I'll note that each segment improved their combined ratios in the fourth quarter compared to last year as they continue to grow profitably. Our Commercial segment improved its full year 2023 combined ratio by 3.0 percentage points compared with 2022 and grew net written premiums by 4%. Our Personal Lines segment grew net written premiums by 26%, with growth for middle market business in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business, its combined ratio was 1.2 percentage points higher than last year due to the catastrophe loss ratio rising 3.7 points. Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment was very profitable, producing a 2023 combined ratio of 90.6% with net written premium growth of 14%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global were also very profitable. Cincinnati Re's full year combined ratio was an excellent 77.7%. Its net written premiums were 5% lower than in 2022, reflecting our opportunistic positioning of the portfolio through evolving market conditions. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 75.5%, with 22% growth in net written premiums. Our Life Insurance subsidiary grew profit and premiums too, as full year 2023 net income rose 15% and earned premiums grew 4%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2024 are fairly similar to 2023, other than an average premium rate increase of approximately 12%. The primary objective of our property catastrophe treaty is to protect our balance sheet. The treaty's main change this year is adding another $100 million of coverage, increasing the [top] of the program from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Should we experience a 2024 catastrophe event totaling $1.2 billion in losses, we will retain $423 million compared with $617 million in 2023 for an event of that magnitude. We expect 2024 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $180 million, more than the actual $136 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2023 due to additional coverage, rate increase and subject to premium growth. Those who follow our company, know we prefer to track our success over a long time horizon. Consistent with that approach, we set a target for the value creation ratio, our primary performance measure, at an annual average of 10% to 13% over the next 5 years. We believe the VCR is an appropriate measure since it's driven by strong combined ratio results, premium growth that exceeds the industry average and contributions from our investment portfolio. Since 2016, our combined ratio 5-year average has ranged from 94.3% to 96.1%, near the low end of the longer-term target of 95% to 100%, we disclosed for many years. And for more than a decade, we've recorded results ahead of the industry for premium growth on a 5-year compound annual growth rate basis. Because we believe we can continue to perform at a high level we are setting our sights on a longer-term combined ratio better than the past target, now targeting a 5-year average of 92% to 98%. While we will no longer publicly disclose annual targets for combined ratio and premium growth, we expect to continue our robust disclosure detail to help investors model and form their own expectations of future results. This doesn't mean that we'll ignore the shorter-term results. We recognize that it also means that to achieve our revised long-term target range, some years we need to reach combined ratios towards the lower end, knowing there could be some years like 2022 that come in near the higher end. I'll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with the value creation ratio. Our 15.2%, 5-year annual average VCR as of year-end 2023 exceeded our target range of 10% to 13%. VCR of 19.5% for full year 2023 included a contribution of 9.1% from net income before investment gains or losses while higher valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 10.4%. Now Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results and other important aspects of our financial performance."", 'Michael James Sewell', ""Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income was a significant part of higher net income and improved operating results, up 15% for the fourth quarter and 14% for a full year 2023 compared with the same periods of last year. Dividend income was up 7% for the quarter, largely due to a special dividend from one of our stock holdings. On a full year 2023 basis, we added to the equity portfolio with net purchases totaling $14 million. Bond interest income, again, grew at a good pace, up 19% for the fourth quarter of the year. We continue to add fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $1.4 billion for full year 2023. The fourth quarter pretax average yield of 4.48% for the fixed maturity portfolio rose 32 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during 2023 was 6.13%. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. Before tax effects, the net gain was [$1.050 billion] for the equity portfolio and $621 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of 2023, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.1 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.7 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $570 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income as did rising bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2023 was just over $2 billion, matching last year. Regarding expense management, we always intend to strive to an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. Our full year 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio at 30.0% was in line with 2022, while the fourth quarter ratio was 1.3 percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to higher profit sharing commissions for agencies and associate related expenses. Next, I'll summarize loss reserve activity. Our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. Our quarterly study of updated paid and case reserve loss and loss expense data for our commercial casualty line of business considered how fourth quarter incurred amounts were higher than we expected, especially for the general liability coverages for older accident years. To reflect the continued uncertainty of ultimate losses and loss expenses, we increased our estimates for several prior accident years to levels more likely to be adequate. The net amount of the fourth quarter increase was $51 million, including $29 million for accident years prior to 2019. Commercial casualty unfavorable reserve development on a full year 2023 basis was fairly small at $15 million, only 0.5% of the year-end 2022 reserve balance. Prior accident year reserve development for commercial umbrella during 2023 and was a favorable $6 million. During 2023, our net addition to total property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $682 million, including $634 million for the IBNR portion. For full year 2023, we experienced $215 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.8 percentage points, marking 35 consecutive years of net favorable development on prior accident year loss and loss expense reserves.On an online basis by accident year, net reserve development for full year 2023 included a favorable $137 million for 2022, favorable $21 million for 2021, favorable $68 million for 2020 and an unfavorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020.I'll conclude with a few capital management highlights, another area where our approach includes careful consideration of the long term. We paid $116 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not repurchase any shares. Our view of our financial flexibility and our financial strength is that both remain in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital continue to be under 10%. And our year-end 2023 book value of $77.06 per share means the $12.1 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity provides plenty of opportunity for profitable growth by supporting $8.1 billion of annual property casualty net written premiums.Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."", 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment on our recent leadership and Board announcements. Effective at our annual shareholder meeting in May, President Steve Spray, will add the role of Chief Executive Officer. Steve is the right person to build on our decade of profitable growth. He understands the importance of our agency-centered strategy and the unique advantages it brings. I'm confident in his ability to bring innovative ideas together with the hallmarks of Cincinnati Insurance to create opportunities for associates, agents and shareholders. I look forward to continuing to work with him as Chairman of the Board.We also announced the addition of Steve and Peter Wu as Cincinnati Financial Directors. Peter has exceptional experience in the worlds of predictive analytics, data modeling and artificial intelligence. I'm honored that he has agreed to join our Board.Finally, the Board set the stage for a 64th consecutive year of raising shareholder dividends by increasing the dividend 8% to $0.81 per share. From the Board to the leadership team, to associates at every level of our company, we have the perfect people in place to create a bright future for Cincinnati Financial. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer.Rocco, please open the call for questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer."", 'Michael Wayne Phillips', ""I guess, first off, congrats to Mr. Spray on your news and Steve Johnston, didn't say it himself but you'll be missed. But look forward to hopefully hear more from you in the future. But congrats to all you guys on that. I guess -- my first question is on the [PYD], I guess. It looks like some of the issues there might be in the umbrella maybe some (inaudible) you guys are great for giving disclosure on this stuff. But can you talk -- some of your (inaudible) talk about the large loss activity and the claim count there certainly went up quite a bit in the quarter, that's not just because the inflation impact of that and what's happening there. But can you talk about any changes in maybe the mix of your limit profile from 2022 into 2023 and maybe some of that mix might be impacted? Are you writing at more higher limits, I guess, is the punchline there? And then maybe talk about how -- I think there's a perception that your 3-year policy terms may give you some shield when rates get soft and pricing gets soft but maybe are you sort of hand-tied a little bit if there's more of a urgent need to re-rate on these higher limit policies?"", 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""Mike, this is Steve Johnston. I'll start off and turn it over to Steve Spray here. It's just with the commercial casualty, it was not umbrella. We addressed that -- we think really early a year ago, second quarter, I believe and we've really -- we think tamed that, brought that under control and we're actually producing an underwriting profit now for our umbrella lines. So it's the commercial casualty part other than umbrella.And when we get to this point, we're looking at our year-end reserve analysis for all the lines of business and it gives us the chance, puts us in a position to look at the data for the full year. So our focus is on estimating the full year. And for the full year, for commercial casualty, including umbrella, all of that and we're showing just under $15 million or 1 loss ratio point in adverse development on the prior accident years, as Mike mentioned.Now to further put that in perspective, as Mike said, it's $15 million, its just 0.5% of the casualty reserves and 0.2% of the total reserves carried at December 31, 2022. So it's really, as we look at the full year, not a big number. In fact, also for the full year, our total property casualty accident year development was favorable, 2.8 loss ratio points. That's an improvement from the 2.3 points of the prior year. And also that 2.8 loss ratio is very much in range of where we've been for the last several years. And I always want to point out that makes now 35 years consecutively that we've had favorable development for Cincinnati Insurance and our reserves.There was quarterly volatility through the year. For example, we reported favorable development for prior accident years of $34 million or 9.2 loss ratio points for the second quarter for commercial casualty. As we looked at the fourth quarter, and as Mike mentioned and you're mentioning there was more larger losses. I wouldn't consider it a trend but there was more larger losses in the fourth quarter just as there were maybe a dearth of that in the second quarter. The advantage is, we get to look at the full year here and do as we always do and try to be very prudent. We're reading what's going on with the industry. And we thought for the full year, it would not be prudent to release reserves or have favorable development on the prior years.So I know the fourth quarter, that 14 loss ratio points appears to be a big number and it is a big number. But I think in context of looking at the full year and what you'll see in the Schedule P, what you'll see in the 10-K, I think when you combine it with the other lines where workers' comp, we did the same type of a procedure and we had 31-point loss ratio points of favorable development, also had favorable development for commercial auto and most of our lines, favorable development and again for the 35th year. To keep that 35-year streak like that, you have to take action when you see it. We saw the larger losses in the fourth quarter. And I think to -- braving the year ahead and where we thought it would be a prudent position not to release casualty reserves. We arrived at our best estimate in the number that we produced.Let's turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the other question that you had."", 'Stephen Michael Spray', ""Yes. Mike, like Steve said, we had -- it was not umbrella. We did notice as you recall, back in 2022, some challenges with the umbrella line, we jumped on that, working with our agents in Commercial Lines underwriting. The limits profile there has always been the vast majority of those accounts, those umbrellas. It's a low limit book profile, it's probably become a little -- even more low limit over the last 1.5 years as we took action, both pricing and capacity on specific segments, some specific classes of business and then some specific venues where we felt that the environment was just a little more difficult.Steve also mentioned that umbrella line was modestly profitable in 2023. And we've got a long-term profitable record with umbrella and we look to continue to grow that. So that was, I think, your limits question. The other question you had, Mike, was on the 3-year policy. We're as committed to that 3-year policy as we ever have been. I think it resonates with policyholders and with our agents. So our desire for long-term relationships. Our 3-year policy -- package policy actually outperforms a 1-year contract from an underwriting standpoint. Our underwriters use the art and science of pricing. And you can see -- we can see it in the book that they use it -- they're using it the right way and we're getting profitable results from the 3-year policy.You mentioned the muting effect with pricing and make a long story short, about 75% of our premiums in commercial lines, even on a 3-year policy are adjusted on an annual basis. So 75% of the premiums are being adjusted annually. Again, just committed to that 3-year. And we think it's -- again, it shows the marketplace that we want long-term relationships and our retentions at the first and second anniversary of a 3-year policy are about 10 points higher than we actually have at renewal. So there's an added benefit to it as well. Hopefully, the answers were helpful, right?"", 'Michael Wayne Phillips', ""Yes, it does. And it sounds like you're not concerned about the, what looks like a spike in the large loss activity. You certainly have the annual track record to prove it. I guess my second question is on personal auto. You -- a real quick turnaround in the profitability in commercial auto, I guess. Is there anything that's kind of a one-off to drive that down to [66.7%] kind of in loss ratio in personal auto that drove that down? Or is it just rates running in? And is that kind of a good run rate from here given where your rates have been?"", 'Stephen Michael Spray', 'Mike, could you -- did you say commercial auto or personal auto? You broke up.', 'Michael Wayne Phillips', ""Personal auto, if I said commercial, I meant personal auto, I hope that's what I said, personal auto."", 'Stephen Michael Spray', ""Yes. So again, Steve Spray. Yes, I think it is a lot of -- it's blocking and tackling. It's sophisticated pricing that we continue to develop, segmentation, precision in the pricing. And as you know, I think inflation probably hit the personal auto line as hard as any line of business in P&C. And we reacted accordingly and it's a lot of rate that is continuing to burn into that book."", 'Michael Wayne Phillips', ""Okay. So really nothing -- any kind of anomalies but that's -- looks like -- it sounds like a good rate kind of at least a trend from here."", 'Stephen Michael Spray', ""Yes. The only other thing I might add is, over time, our mix of business in Personal Lines is moving. We're growing both the middle market segment and high net worth. But over time, we think that the high net worth business, as it always has or traditionally has, will outperform the middle market space and that personal auto is a less percentage of the package with high net worth or private client than it is on the middle market. So I think mix of business is probably helping us as well."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO.', 'Michael David Zaremski', ""I guess sticking -- going back to the reserving color. Just trying to understand bigger picture. So the reserve charge in casualty and as you stated, on an absolute basis, isn't a huge number. And so just trying to understand, are you making a material change to kind of your forward loss trend too, given what you've learned in casualty? Or is this just simply the Cinci way of doing things, you're reacting to bad news, trying to get ahead of it and this is just really a small tweak that doesn't kind of touch on the changes you made back in '22 on umbrella?"", 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""Yes. Good question and it's the latter, Mike. We don't see it as a material change in our trend. We feel very good about the position that we are in terms of our rate versus our trend. And keep in mind, we're forward-looking. We're looking for where do we think the loss costs will be out in the prospective policy period. We feel good about that. A little bit historic as we do see good improvement in those accident year ex cat combined ratios, which I think gives credence to it. And so it's more of the latter of doing things in Cincinnati way, recognizing some large losses when we see them and also what's going on in the industry and being prudent with our reserves to keep that 35 years of favorable development streak going to 36 years."", 'Michael David Zaremski', ""Understood. And just curious, in a good way, Cincinnati is in my understanding, kind of branching into, I guess, broadening the customer base, you can write policies for on the commercial side in terms of going down market into BOP and I believe, into larger commercial too. I am just curious, as -- if I'm right about that, as you've gone on this journey in recent years, does that just kind of bring in a little bit more potential volatility in the early years as you kind of learn more about those kind of newer client segments? Is there anything there?"", 'Stephen Michael Spray', ""No, I don't think it brings in any more volatility than what we would normally experience, Mike. We've always had an agency strategy. So we -- we're trying to be as important to each agency that we do business with and be an important partner for all segments, whether it's small, like the BOP, you mentioned, middle markets or larger accounts. We've always written small business. We've always written larger accounts. That small business, a lot of times, is more of a technology play. And we have -- we have launched just an excellent platform, not because I say so but because our agency feedback is telling us that it's intuitive and it's easy. So I expect that you'll see us continue to make big strides in the small business area.And then on the, what we call key accounts, larger accounts, commercially, we've added a lot of expertise in that area, we're growing it and we're growing it in a conservative manner. And very -- we're underwriting profit first but our runway on larger accounts and keep moving, I guess, upstream as one might say is, I think, is very positive too."", 'Michael David Zaremski', ""Okay. Got it. And lastly, just on the -- in my understanding, there's no change to the value creation ratio target but you're bringing down the -- or you're improving the long-term combined ratio target. Maybe just, can you kind of just help us clarify why, why no -- what brought about that change? And is there any financial incentives that are going to change on a forward-looking basis when we look at the proxy or whatnot because of the combined ratio change?"", 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""Good question. No, there will not be any change in the compensation targets in that regard. We have been very, I think, consistent in the combined ratio. We've got 12 years in a row now with a combined ratio under 100%. And so we've seen it be as low as 88.3%. And so we felt that we could lower that long-term target down and put us in a position to continue to be long-term thinkers there.I think there's also been great consistency in the value creation ratio. If we look at the 5-year average VCR going back to the 5 years ended 2013, all of those 5-year ending years from 2013 through 2023 have all been double digits. So we are just reflecting our long-term focus and raising the bar a bit on where we put that long-term combined ratio for you."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today comes from Greg Peters at Raymond James.', 'Charles Gregory Peters', ""Congratulations on your 35-year track record and Mr. Spray, you have your work cut out for you to keep that going for the next 5 years. So good luck to you on that. Can we step back and -- you provided some data around pricing. And maybe you can help us frame how to think about new business growth, both commercial, personal and E&S as we think about the next 12 months when we compare it to what happened in '23?"", 'Stephen Michael Spray', ""I would -- this is Steve Spray, Greg. Let me start with Commercial Lines. We use the same predictive modeling tools and have our field underwriters use the art of underwriting and balance that. And if you recall, we started off 2023, new business was -- we were under some pressure for new business. We were keeping our pricing discipline going there. And as the year progressed, I'd like to say we kind of saw the market come our way. And new businesses continued to get better and better throughout the year in '23 and again, kept that pricing and underwriting discipline.Personal Lines, the new business there and the net written premium growth has just been strong throughout the year. And I just think we're in such a good position going forward in Personal Lines as well because we're -- like I said earlier, we have an agency strategy and we've become a premier market, both in middle market and high net worth for our agencies and they tell us that regularly. And with our $12 billion of GAAP equity supporting a $8 billion of premium, we're in a good position with our balance sheet to continue to grow Personal Lines through this, I'll call a tumultuous market. So feels really good about that.On the E&S side, 90.6% combined ratio are better now for 11 years in a row. It's about 90% casualty, the submission counts there continue to be strong. You can see that the new business throughout 2023 was strong and I don't see any reason why that won't continue into 2024 as well."", 'Charles Gregory Peters', ""Okay. I was also listening to your comments about the movements around the reserves. And I was just wondering if you had any comments on just the paid loss trend. It looks like paid losses grew a little bit faster for the full year '23 than they did in '22. Just wondering -- is that just -- is there any noise in there or anything you'd like to call out?"", 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""Yes. I would think there really isn't anything to call out there, Greg. I think it's just -- we're growing and then paid losses (inaudible) we've seen that fluctuate from year-to-year. And so there would be some noise there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""It's [Gino] for Meyer. My first question -- on the follow-up for commercial casualty reserves, just mainly on the $51 million and $29 million reserve charge prior to accident year 2019, you mentioned some -- you outlined some large losses. Is there any other new trend that you're seeing in 4Q?"", 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""No, not really. I think that I don't see it as a trend. I think we did recognize it. Like I said, there was some volatility through the year. We would have had less of that in the second quarter when we released or recognized the 9.2 points of favorable development. I think we just look -- are looking at this now as the whole year and doing our best to put our best estimate forward for the year, which amounted to the $15 million and never want to minimize $15 million. But I think in the grand scheme of things, it's pretty close to [awash] and puts us in a position to continue to have the type of reserve strength and quality of balance sheet that we do."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Got it. My second question is on the combined ratio target. You mentioned 5-year average of 92% to 98% to the midpoint at 95%. So does that imply that less than 95% combined ratio for '24? Or is there any color you can provide for '24?"", 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""No, it doesn't imply a 95% for 2024. And so we're not really giving a 2024 number here. We're again, focusing on the long term that we've had, consistent underwriting profits. We think that the long term of 95% to 100% is something that we can strive for the long time -- long term to do better and have that be 92% to 98%. We know there'll be some years that it'll be a little bit higher. I think we've been under 100% for 12 consecutive years. I think the highest was 98.1%, the lowest 88.3%. And so there's going to be variation in market cycles and weather and so forth. We want to focus on the long term where we continue to grow above the industry average, do it at a good underwriting profit and invest well such that, that value creation ratio stays double digit. There'll be some volatility there as investments are a little bit volatility but over the long pull, which is what we shoot for, we're a long-term strategy team here, we think we can lower that long-term combined ratio range from 95% to 100% to 92% to 98%."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Got you. Perfect. Can I sneak in one more? Just on the expense ratio, we are seeing it trending up quarter-over-quarter. In 2023, you mentioned some high share commission, et cetera, in 4Q. How should we think about the run rate for 2024? Any kind of color you have there would be great.', 'Michael James Sewell', ""Yes. This is Mike Sewell. I think we've kind of really said over the last couple of years that we've been targeting a 30% expense ratio. And so we're still looking at that. We're shooting for that and we're actually there for the last 2 years. So I'm kind of setting my sights. And we're not going to give up. We're going to keep investing where we need to invest, keep controlling costs where we think we can control it better. And any time that we can get that below 30%, we're going to try to do that. So I'm targeting for below 30% but I'm happy where it is. But we can always improve."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Grace Carter, Bank of America.', 'Grace Helen Carter', 'I was looking for the commercial casualty reserve development, you mentioned that, I think $29 million of it was related to prior to 2019. I was hoping we could zoom in on the remaining piece. And I guess just considering how claims activity was suppressed during the pandemic, if you can help us think through how the pandemic years are developing relative to your expectations? And just any sort of surprise in the trends there? And how much of the commercial casualty total reserve base we should think of accident years 2020 to 2022 comprising?', 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""Grace, this is Steve Johnston. I think we can get you those numbers. I do not have like the carried reserves for those years in front of me here that -- what we would carry for those years. I do feel that we are looking at the pandemic years as, obviously, they were challenges we were going through the pandemic with the economy slowing down and -- of course and so forth. But I do think that now it's been well behaved."", 'Grace Helen Carter', 'And I guess, kind of considering how interest rates have been or were lower in the decade following the financial crisis with a pretty sharp change in that over the past couple of years, conventional industry wisdom has kind of historically suggested that if you have better investment income, maybe you can let your combined ratio float up a little bit higher. So I guess considering the potential for higher interest rates to stick around for longer, I was just wondering your thoughts on that and if you think that, that no longer holds in light of the updated combined ratio guidance and just the extent to which the prevailing interest rate environment influences how you think about your outlook?', 'Steven Justus Johnston', ""Great question. I think we would be slow to change those combined ratio targets because interest rates, as we've seen, can fluctuate more quickly than the loss ratios of books of business. And so I think it would be risky to see high interest rates or higher interest rates and react by lowering your standard on a combined ratio when there would be good chance, I think, over the next 10 years that interest rates would go back down. I would expect that over the next 10 years, a lot of what I've seen in terms of interest rate expectation is to go down.If you got yourself in a situation where you reacted to the higher interest rates with a higher combined ratio target, you can't recalibrate and cash back up as quickly as those interest rates change. So we are going to stay conservative in terms of our loss ratio targets."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Jack on for Mike. I'm just -- you guided to buying more reinsurance and ceding more premiums. Any color on how you expect those changes to impact the combined ratio in 2024?"", 'Stephen Michael Spray', ""Jack, this is Steve Spray. We -- on the -- I'll say, on the property cat (inaudible) we buy that for balance sheet protection. And last -- if you recall, last year, we increased our retention on the property cat from $100 million to $200 million. We renewed it for '24 with that same $200 million retention. And we also then bought another $100 million on top. So now the total program is $1.2 billion. We obviously balance the cost of that with what we're trying to do on the loss ratio but again, always keeping in mind that it's for balance sheet protection, not earnings.I would also note that in that $1.2 billion tower that we have for the property cat, we also filled out some more of the, we'll call it, maybe the middle layers this year than what we did for the 2023 year. So no guidance on loss ratio for you on that but just maybe a little background or color on the property cat treaty."", 'Operator', ""And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Steve Johnston for any closing remarks."", 'Steven Justus Johnston', 'Thank you, Rocco. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2024 call.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.""]"

With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC."", ""Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and, therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now, I'll turn over the call to Steve."", 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We had strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, and I'm happy to see that our hard work is reflected in the progress we are making. Net income rose $170 million to nearly $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year, including $18 million more benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities still held in our equity portfolio."", 'Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was up 78% or $157 million versus a year ago. And on a full-year basis, it was 42% higher than 2022. Our 87.5%, fourth-quarter property casualty combined ratio was 7.4 percentage points better than in 2022. With the catastrophe loss ratio representing 6.5 points of the improvement.', 'That strong underwriting performance followed our recent pattern of improvement, resulting in a 94.9% full-year 2023 combined ratio. That was 3.2 percentage points better than last year, including a decrease of 0.5 points in the catastrophe loss ratio. Our 2023 ex-cat accident year combined ratios were also favorable compared with 2022, improving 2.1 percentage points to 85.7% for the fourth quarter and 1.8 points to 88.4% for the year. We saw positive momentum in many areas of operating performance.', 'Growth for consolidated property casualty net written premiums accelerated, reaching 13% for the fourth quarter, including 10% for renewal premiums and 30% for new business premiums. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve performance and to counter the continuing effects and inflation on insured losses, we combine pricing segmentation by risk with average price increases and careful risk selection. Estimated average renewal price increases for the fourth quarter continued at a healthy pace. Our commercial lines insurance segment, again, averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range.', ""Personal lines for the fourth quarter included auto, continuing in the low double-digit range, and homeowner continuing near the low end of the high single-digit range. Policy retention rates in 2023 were similar to 2022, with our commercial lines segment down slightly but still in the upper 80% range. In our personal lines segment, up slightly but still in the low to mid-90% range. Briefly reviewing operating performance by insurance segment, I'll focus on the full-year results."", ""Although I'll note that each segment improved their combined ratios in the fourth quarter compared to last year as they continue to grow profitably. Our commercial segment improved its full-year 2023 combined ratio by 3.0 percentage points compared with 2022 and grew net written premiums by 4%. Our personal lines segment grew net written premiums by 26%, with growth for middle market business in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business, its combined ratio was 1.2 percentage points higher than last year due to the catastrophe loss ratio rising 3.7 points. Our excess and surplus line segment was very profitable, producing a 2023 combined ratio of 90.6% with net room premium growth of 14%."", ""Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global were also very profitable. Cincinnati Re's full-year combined ratio was an excellent 77.7%. Its net written premiums were 5% lower than in 2022, reflecting our opportunistic positioning of the portfolio through evolving market conditions. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 75.5%, with 22% growth in net written premiums."", 'Our life insurance subsidiary grew profit and premiums to as full-year 2023 net income rose 15%, and earned premiums grew 4%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For our per-risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2024 are fairly similar to 2023, other than an average premium rate increase of approximately 12%. The primary objective of our Property Catastrophe Treaty is to protect our balance sheet.', ""The treaty's main change this year is adding another $100 million of coverage, increasing the top of the program from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Should we experience a 2024 catastrophe event totaling $1.2 billion in losses, we will retain $423 million, compared with $617 million in 2023 for an event of that magnitude. We expect 2024 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $180 million, more than the actual $136 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2023 due to additional coverage, rate increase, and subject premium growth. Folks who follow our company know we prefer to track our success over a longtime horizon."", ""Consistent with that approach, we set a target for the value creation ratio, our primary performance measure, at an annual average of 10% to 13% over the next five years. We believe the VCR is an appropriate measure since it's driven by strong combined ratio results, premium growth that exceeds the industry average, and contributions from our investment portfolio. Since 2016, our combined ratio of five-year average has ranged from 94.3% to 96.1%, near the low end of the longer-term target of 95% to 100% we've disclosed for many years. And for more than a decade, we've recorded results ahead of the industry for premium growth on a five-year compound annual growth rate basis."", ""Because we believe we can continue to perform at a high level, we are setting our sights on a longer-term combined ratio better than the past target, now targeting a five-year average of 92% to 98%. While we will no longer publicly disclose annual targets for combined ratio and premium growth, we expect to continue our robust disclosure detail to help investors model and form their own expectations of future results. This doesn't mean that we'll ignore the shorter-term results. We recognize that it also means that to achieve our revised long-term target range, some years we need to reach combined ratios toward the lower end, knowing there could be some years like 2022 that come in near the higher end."", ""I'll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with the value creation ratio. Our 15.2%, five-year annual average VCR as of year-end 2023 exceeded our target range of 10% to 13%. VCR of 19.5% for full year 2023 included a contribution of 9.1% from net income before investment gains or losses, while higher valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 10.4%. Now, Chief Financial Officer Mike Sewell will highlight investment results and other important aspects of our financial performance."", 'Mike Sewell -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income was a significant part of higher net income and improved operating results, up 15% for the fourth quarter and 14% for a full year 2023 compared with the same periods of last year. Dividend income was up 7% for the quarter, largely due to a special dividend from one of our stock holdings. On a full-year 2023 basis, we added to the equity portfolio with net purchases totaling $14 million.', 'Bond interest income, again, grew at a good pace, up 19% for the fourth quarter of the year. We continue to add fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $1.4 billion for full year 2023. The fourth-quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.48% for the fixed maturity portfolio rose 32 basis points compared with last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during 2023 was 6.13%.', 'Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. Before tax effects, the net gain was $1.05 billion for the equity portfolio and $621 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of 2023, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.1 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.7 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $570 million.', 'Cash flow continued to benefit investment income as did rising bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2023 was just over $2 billion matching last year. Regarding expense management, we always intend to strive to an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. Our full-year 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio at 30% was in line with 2022, while the fourth-quarter ratio was 1.3% -- percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to higher profit sharing commissions for agencies and associate-related expenses.', ""Next, I'll summarize loss reserve activity. Our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves, and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. Our quarterly study of updated paid and case reserve loss and loss expense data for our commercial casualty line of business considered how fourth-quarter incurred amounts were higher than we expected, especially for the general liability coverages for older accident years. To reflect the continued uncertainty of ultimate losses and loss expenses, we increased our estimates for several prior accident years to levels more likely to be adequate."", 'The net amount of the fourth-quarter increase was $51 million, including $29 million for accident years prior to 2019. Commercial casualty unfavorable reserve development on a full-year 2023 basis was fairly small at $15 million, only 0.5% of the year-end 2022 reserve balance. Prior accident year reserve development for commercial umbrella during 2023 and was a favorable $6 million. During 2023, our net addition to total property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $682 million, including $634 million for the IBNR portion.', ""For full year 2023, we experienced $215 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.8 percentage points, marking 35 consecutive years of net favorable development on prior accident year loss and loss expense reserves. On an online basis by accident year, net reserve development for full year 2023 included a favorable $137 million for 2022, favorable $21 million for 2021, favorable $68 million for 2020, and an unfavorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. I'll conclude with a few capital management highlights. Another area where our approach includes careful consideration of the long term."", 'We paid $116 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not repurchase any shares. Our view of our financial flexibility and our financial strength is that both remain in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital continue to be under 10%.', ""And our year-end 2023 book value of $77.06 per share means the $12.1 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity provides plenty of opportunity for profitable growth by supporting $8.1 billion of annual property casualty net written premiums. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."", 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment on our recent leadership and board announcements. Effective at our annual shareholder meeting in May, President Steve Spray will add the role of chief executive officer. Steve is the right person to build on our decade of profitable growth."", ""He understands the importance of our agency-centered strategy and the unique advantages it brings. I'm confident in his ability to bring innovative ideas together with the hallmarks of Cincinnati Insurance to create opportunities for associates, agents, and shareholders. I look forward to continuing to work with him as chairman of the board. We also announced the addition of Steve and Peter Wu as Cincinnati Financial Directors."", ""Peter has exceptional experience in the world of predictive analytics, data modeling, and artificial intelligence. I'm honored that he has agreed to join our board. Finally, the board set the stage for a 64th consecutive year of raising shareholder dividends by increasing the dividend 8% to $0.81 per share. From the board to the leadership team, to associates at every level of our company, we have the perfect people in place to create a bright future for Cincinnati Financial."", 'As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow, and Theresa Hoffer. Rocco, please open the call for questions.', '', 'Operator', ""Absolutely. [Operator instructions] Today's first question comes from Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead."", 'Mike Phillips -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess, first off, congrats to Mr. Spray on your news, and Steve Johnston, say it isn't so, but you'll be missed."", 'But look forward to hopefully hear more from you in the future. But congrats to all you guys on that.', 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Mike.', 'Mike Phillips -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', ""You're welcome. My first question is on the PYD, I guess. It looks like some of the issues there might be in the umbrella maybe some large royalty -- you guys are great for giving disclosure on this stuff. But can you talk -- some of the exhibits talked about the large loss activity, and the claim count there certainly went up quite a bit in the quarter is just because the inflation impact of that and what's happening there."", ""But can you talk about any changes in maybe the mix of your limit profile from 2022 into 2023 and maybe some of that mix might be impacted? Are you writing more higher limits, I guess, is the punchline there? And then maybe talk about how -- I think there's a perception that your three-year policy terms may give you some shield when rates get soft and pricing gets soft. But maybe are you sort of hand-tied a little bit if there's more of an urgent need to rerate on these higher limit policies? Thanks."", 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Mike. This is Steve Johnston. I'll start off and turn it over to Steve Spray here. It's just with the commercial casualty, it was not umbrella."", ""We addressed that we think really early a year ago, second quarter, I believe. And we've really -- we think pain that, brought that under control, and we're actually producing an underwriting profit now for our umbrella lines. So, it's the commercial casualty part other than umbrella. And when we get to this point, we're looking at our year-end reserve analysis for all the lines of business, and it gives us the chance to put us in a position to look at the data for the full year."", ""So, our focus is on estimating the full year. And for the full year, for commercial casualty, including umbrella and all of that, and we're showing just under 15 million or one loss ratio point in adverse development on the prior accident years, as Mike mentioned. Now, to further put that in perspective, as Mike said, this 15 million is just 0.5% of the casualty reserves and 0.2% of the total reserves carried at December 31st, 2022. So, it's really as we look at the full year, not a big number."", ""In fact, also for the full year, our total property casualty accident year development was favorable, 2.8 loss ratio points. That's an improvement from the 2.3 points of the prior year. And also that 2.8 is very much in the range of where we've been for the last several years. And I always want to point out that makes now 35 years consecutively that we've had favorable development for Cincinnati Insurance and our reserves."", ""There was quarterly volatility through the year. For example, we reported favorable development for prior accident years of 34 million or 9.2 loss ratio points for the second quarter for commercial casualty. As we looked at the fourth quarter, and as Mike mentioned, and you're mentioning, there was more larger losses. I wouldn't consider it a trend, but there was more larger losses in the fourth quarter just as there were maybe a dearth of that in the second quarter."", ""The advantage is we get to look at the full year here and do as we always do and try to be very prudent. We're reading what's going on with the industry. And we thought for the full year, it would not be prudent to release reserves or have favorable development on the prior years. So, I know the fourth quarter, that 14 loss ratio points appears to be a big number, and it is a big number."", ""But I think in context of looking at the full year and what you'll see in the Schedule P, what you'll see in the 10-K, I think when you combine it with the other lines where workers' comp, we did the same type of a procedure, and we had 31-point loss ratio points of favorable development, also had favorable development for commercial auto and most of our lines, favorable development again for the 35th year. To keep a 35-year streak like that, you have to take action when you see it. We saw the larger losses in the fourth quarter. And I think to bring the year in where we thought it would be a prudent position not to release casualty reserves."", 'We arrived at our best estimate in the number that we produced. Mike, turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the other question that you had.', 'Steve Spray -- President', 'Yeah. Mike, like Steve said, we had -- it was not umbrella. We did notice as you recall, back in 2022, some challenges with the umbrella line, we jumped on that, working with our agents and commercial lines underwriting. The limits profile there has always been the vast majority of those accounts, those umbrellas.', ""It's a low-limit book profile, has probably become a little even more low limit over the last 1.5 years as we took action, both pricing and capacity on specific segments, some specific classes of business, and then some specific venues where we felt that the environment was just a little more difficult. Steve also mentioned that umbrella line was modestly profitable in 2023. And we've got a long-term profitable record with umbrella, and we look to continue to grow that. So, that was, I think, your limits question."", ""The other question you had, Mike, is on the three-year policy. We're as committed to that three-year policy as we ever have been. I think it resonates with policyholders and with our agents. So, our desire for long-term relationships, our three-year policy, package policy, actually outperforms a one-year contract from an underwriting standpoint."", ""Our underwriters use the art and science of pricing. And you can see -- we can see it in the book that they -- they're using it the right way, and we're getting profitable results from the three-year policy. You mentioned the muting effect with pricing. And to make a long story short, about 75% of our premiums in commercial lines, even on a three-year policy, are adjusted on an annual basis."", ""So, 75% of the premiums are being adjusted annually. Again, just committed to that three-year. And we think it's -- again, it shows the marketplace that we want long-term relationships. And our retentions at the first and second anniversary of a three-year policy are about 10 points higher than we actually have a renewal."", ""So, there's an added benefit to it as well. Hopefully, that answer would be helpful."", 'Mike Phillips -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'Yes, it does. Yeah, thank you guys both very much. It sounds like you are not concerned about what looks like a spike in the large loss activity. You certainly have the annual track record to prove it.', ""So, thank you for that. I guess my second question is on personal auto, a real quick turnaround in the profitability in commercial auto. I guess, is there anything that's kind of a one-off to drive that down to 66.7 current accident year loss ratio on personal auto that drove it down or is it just rates running in? And is that kind of a good run-rate from here given where your rates have been? Thanks."", 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Mike, could you -- did you say commercial auto or personal auto? You broke up.', 'Mike Phillips -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', ""Personal auto. If I said commercial, I didn't mean it. I meant personal auto. I hope that's what I said, personal auto."", 'Steve Spray -- President', ""Yes. It just broke up. I didn't hear it. Yeah."", ""So, again, Steve Spray. Yes, I think it is a lot of -- it's blocking and tackling. It's sophisticated pricing that we continue to develop, segmentation, precision in the pricing. And as you know, I think inflation probably hit the personal auto line as hard as any line of business in P&C."", ""And we reacted accordingly, and it's a lot of rate that is continuing to burn into that book."", 'Mike Phillips -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'OK. So, really nothing -- any kind of anomalies, but that looks like -- it sounds like a good rate kind of at least a trend from here.', 'Steve Spray -- President', ""Yeah. The only other thing I might add is, over time, our mix of business and personal lines is moving. We're growing both the middle market segment and high net worth. But over time, we think that the high net worth business, as it always has or traditionally has, will outperform the middle market space."", 'And that personal auto is a less percentage of the package with high net worth or private client than it is on the middle market. So, I think mix of business is probably helping us as well.', 'Mike Phillips -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'OK, perfect. Thank you, guys. And congrats again to Steve.', 'Steve Spray -- President', 'Thanks, Mike.', 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.', 'Mike Zaremski -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning. I guess sticking -- going back to the reserving color, just trying to understand bigger picture. So, the reserve charge in casualty, as you stated, on an absolute basis isn't a huge number. And so, just trying to understand, are you making a material change to kind of your forward loss trend, too, given what you've learned in casualty? Or is this just simply the Cinci way of doing things, you're reacting to bad news, trying to get ahead of it, and this is just really a small tweak that doesn't kind of touch on the changes you made back in '22 on umbrella?"", 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. Good question, and it's the latter, Mike. We don't see it as a material change in our trend. We feel very good about the position that we are in terms of our rate versus our trend."", ""And keep in mind, we're forward-looking. We're looking for where do we think the loss costs will be out in the prospective policy period. We feel good about that. A little bit historic as we do see good improvement in those accident year ex-cat combined ratios, which I think gives credence to it."", ""And so, it's more of the latter of doing things in Cincinnati way, recognizing some large losses when we see them and also what's going on in the industry and being prudent with our reserves to keep that 35 years of favorable development stream going to 36."", 'Mike Zaremski -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Understood. And just curious, in a good way, Cincinnati is, my understanding, kind of branching into, I guess, broadening the customer base. You can write policies for on the commercial side in terms of going down market into BOP and I believe, into larger commercial too. And just curious as -- if I'm right about that, as you've gone on this journey in recent years, does that just kind of bring in a little bit more potential volatility in the early years as you kind of learn more about those kind of newer client segments? Is there anything there?"", 'Steve Spray -- President', ""No, I don't think it brings in any more volatility than what we would normally experience. Mike. We've always had an agency strategy. So, we -- we're trying to be as important to each agency that we do business with and be an important partner for all segments, whether it's small like the BOP you mentioned, middle markets, or larger accounts."", ""We've always written small business. We've always written larger accounts. That small business, a lot of times, is more of a technology play. And we have -- we have launched just an excellent platform, not because I say so, but because our agency feedback is telling us that it's intuitive and it's easy."", ""So, I expect that you'll see us continue to make big strides in the small business area. And then on the -- what we call key accounts, larger accounts, commercially, we've added a lot of expertise in that area. And we're growing it -- we're growing it in a conservative manner and very -- underwriting profit first, but our runway on larger accounts and keep moving, I guess, upstream as one might say is, I think, is very positive, too."", 'Mike Zaremski -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""OK. Got it. And lastly, just on the -- in my understanding, there's no change to the value creation ratio target, but you're bringing down the -- you're improving the long-term combined ratio target. Maybe just can kind of just help us clarify why not -- what brought about that change? And is there any financial incentives that are going to change on a forward-looking basis when we look at the proxy or whatnot because of the combined ratio change?"", 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Good question. No, there will not be any change in the compensation targets in that regard. We have been very, I think, consistent in the combined ratio. We've got 12 years in a row now with a combined ratio under 100."", ""And so, we've seen it be as low as 88.3. And so, we felt that we could lower that long-term target down and put us in a position to continue to be long-term thinkers there. I think there's also been great consistency in the value creation ratio. If we look at the five-year average VCR going back to the five years ended 2013, all of those five-year ending years from 2013 through 2023 have all been double digits."", 'So, we are just reflecting our long-term focus and raising the bar a bit on where we put that long-term combined ratio view.', 'Mike Zaremski -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Understood. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Greg Peters at Raymond James. Please go ahead.', 'Greg Peters -- Raymond James -- Analyst', 'Good morning, everyone. And congratulations on your 35-year track record. And, Mr. Spray, you have your work cut out for you to keep that going for the next five.', ""So, good luck to you on that. Can we step back? And you provided some data around pricing. And maybe you can help us frame how to think about new business growth, both commercial, personal, and E&S as we think about the next 12 months when we compare it to what happened in '23?"", 'Steve Spray -- President', 'I would -- this is Steve Spray, Greg. Let me start with commercial lines. We use the same predictive modeling tools and have our field underwriters use the art of underwriting and balance that. And if you recall, we started off 2023.', ""New business was -- we were under some pressure for new business. We were keeping our pricing discipline going there. And as the year progressed, I'd like to say we kind of saw the market come our way. And new businesses continue to get better and better throughout the year in '23 and, again, kept that pricing and underwriting discipline."", ""Personal lines, the new business there and the net written premium growth has just been strong throughout the year. And I just think we're in such a good position going forward in personal lines as well because we're -- like I said earlier, we have an agency strategy. And we've become a premier market, both in middle market and high net worth for our agencies. And they tell us that regularly."", ""And with our 12 billion of GAAP equity supported 8 billion of premium, we're in a good position with our balance sheet to continue to grow personal lines through this, I'll call it a tumultuous market. So, feel really good about that. On the E&S side, 90.6% combined ratio are better now for 11 years in a row. It's about 90% casualty, the submission counts there continue to be strong."", ""You can see that the new business throughout 2023 was strong, and I don't see any reason why that will continue into 2024 as well."", 'Greg Peters -- Raymond James -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks for the color there. I was also listening to your comments about the movements around the reserves. And I was just wondering if you had any comments on just the paid loss trend.', ""It looks like paid losses grew a little bit faster for the full year '23 than they did in '22. Just wondering, is that just -- is there any noise in there or anything you'd like to call out?"", 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I would think there really isn't anything to call out there, Greg. I think it's just -- we're growing and then paid losses. We've seen that fluctuate from year to year."", 'And so, there would be some noise there.', 'Greg Peters -- Raymond James -- Analyst', 'Fair enough. Thanks for the answers.', 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.', 'Unknown speaker', ""Hi, good morning. It's [Inaudible] on for Meyer. Thanks for taking my question. My first question -- on the follow-up for commercial casualty reserves, just mainly on the 51 million and 29 million reserve charge prior to accident year 2019."", ""You mentioned some -- you outlined some large losses. Is there any other new trends you're seeing in 4Q?"", 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""No, not really. I think that I don't see it as a trend. I think we did recognize it. Like I say, there was some volatility through the year."", ""We would have had less of that in the second quarter when we released or recognized the 9.2 points of favorable development. I think we just look -- are looking at this now as the whole year and doing our best to put our best estimate forward for the year, which amounted to the $15 million and never want to minimize $15 million. But I think in the grand scheme of things, it's pretty close to a wash and puts us in a position to continue to have the type of reserve strength and quality of balance sheet that we do."", 'Unknown speaker', ""Got it. My second question is on the combined ratio target. You mentioned a five-year average of 92 to 98 to the midpoint at 95. So, does that imply that less than 95% combined ratio for '24? Or is there any color you can provide for '24?"", 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""No, it doesn't imply a 95 for 2024. And so, we're not really giving a 2024 number here. We're again, focusing on the long term that we've had consistent underwriting profits. We think that the long term of 95 to 100 is something that we can strive for the long time -- long term to do better and have that be 92 to 98."", ""We know there'll be some years it will be a little bit higher. I think we've been under 100 for 12 consecutive years. I think the highest was 98.1, the lowest 88.3. And so, there's going to be variation in market cycles and weather and so forth."", ""We want to focus on the long term where we continue to grow above the industry average, do it at a good underwriting profit, and invest well such that that value creation ratio stays double digit. There'll be some volatility there as investments are a little bit volatility. But over the long pull, which is what we shoot for, we're a long-term strategy team here, we think we can lower that long-term combined ratio range from 95 to 100 to 92 to 98."", 'Unknown speaker', 'Gotcha. Perfect. Thank you. Can I sneak in one more? Just on the expense ratio, we are seeing it trending up quarter over quarter in 2023.', 'You mentioned some high share commission, etc. in 4Q. How should we think about the run rate for 2024? Any kind of color you have there would be great.', 'Mike Sewell -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Thank you for the question. This is Mike Sewell. I think we've kind of really said over the last couple of years that we've been targeting a 30 expense ratio."", ""And so, we're still looking at that. We're shooting for that, and we're actually there for the last two years. So, I'm kind of setting my sights. And we're not going to give up."", ""We're going to keep investing where we need to invest, keep controlling costs where we think we can control it better. And any time that we can get that below 30, we're going to try to do that. So, I'm targeting for below 30, but I'm happy where it is, but we can always improve."", 'Unknown speaker', 'Thank you so much.', 'Mike Sewell -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Grace Carter, Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Grace Carter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hi, everyone. Good morning. I was looking for the commercial casualty reserve development. You mentioned that, I think 29 million of it was related to prior to 2019.', 'I was hoping we could zoom in on the remaining piece. And, I guess, just considering how claims activity was suppressed during the pandemic, if you can help us think through how the pandemic years are developing relative to your expectations and just any sort of surprise in the trends there. And how much of the commercial casualty total reserve base we should think of accident years 2020 to 2022 comprising?', 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Grace. This is Steve Johnston. I think we can get you those numbers. I do not have like the carried reserves for those years in front of me here what we would carry for those years.', ""I do feel that we are looking at the pandemic years is, obviously, they were challenges we were going through the pandemic with the economy slowing down in ports and so forth. But I do think that now it's been well behaved."", 'Grace Carter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you. And I guess, kind of considering how interest rates have been, were lower in the decade following the financial crisis with a pretty sharp change in that over the past couple of years. Conventional industry wisdom has kind of historically suggested that if you have better investment income, maybe you can let your combined ratio float up a little bit higher. So, I guess considering the potential for higher interest rates to stick around for longer.', 'I was just wondering your thoughts on that and if you think that that no longer holds in light of the updated combined ratio guidance and just the extent to which the prevailing interest rate environment influences how you think about your outlook?', 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Great question. I think we would be slow to change those combined ratio targets because interest rates, as we've seen, can fluctuate more quickly than the loss ratios of books and business. And so, I think it would be risky to see high interest rates or higher interest rates and react by lowering your standard on a combined ratio when there would be a good chance, I think, over the next 10 years that interest rates would go back down. I would expect that over the next 10 years, a lot of what I've seen in terms of interest rate expectation is to go down."", ""If you got yourself in a situation where you reacted to the higher interest rates with a higher combined ratio target, you can't recalibrate and cash back up as quickly as those interest rates change. So, we are going to stay conservative in terms of our loss ratio targets."", 'Grace Carter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Steve Johnston -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', 'Unknown speaker', ""This is Jack on for Mike. Thanks for taking our follow-up. I'm just -- you guided to buying more reinsurance and seeding more premiums. Any color on how you expect those changes to impact the combined ratio in 2024?"", 'Steve Spray -- President', ""Jack, this is Steve Spray. We -- on the -- I'll say, on the property cat treaty, we buy that for balance sheet protection. And last -- if you recall, last year, we increased our retention on the property cap from 100 million to 200 million. We renewed it for '24 with that same $200 million retention."", ""And we also then bought another $100 million on top. So, now the total program is 1.2 billion. We obviously balance the cost of that with what we're trying to do on the loss ratio, but again, always keeping in mind that it's for balance sheet protection, not earnings. I would also note that in that 1.2 billion tower that we have for the property cat, we also filled out some more of the, we'll call it, maybe the middle layers this year than what we did for the 2023 year."", 'So, no guidance on loss ratio for you on that, but just maybe a little background or color on the property cat treaty.', 'Unknown speaker', 'Got it.

This was driven by robust earnings, which helped counter concerns surrounding US regional banks and the Chinese markets. Bonds experienced slight pressure, as statements from Federal Reserve officials reinforced the expectation that the central bank might not reduce interest rates in the near future. According to Arthur Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth:\xa0', '""We are at the midpoint of the 4Q earnings reporting season, and we would say that there has been more good news than bad.""', ""In 2023, the S&P 500 delivered a total return of 26.29%, recovering from the setback of 18.11% in 2022. In 2024, investors remain optimistic that the same macroeconomic factors driving the stock market's 2023 rally will propel the S&P 500 to achieve new all-time highs. Investors remain hopeful that the Federal Reserve will successfully guide the US economy to a soft landing, transitioning from interest rate hikes to rate cuts. The potential combination of declining interest rates and earnings growth is seen as a positive for stocks. However, analysts express worries about overvalued technology sector stocks, and the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election is expected to introduce significant market volatility."", ""Looking at historical data from 1921 to 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research, noted that the average S&P 500 bull market has yielded a return of 157% and lasted over four years. This historical pattern suggests the possibility of the stock market rally continuing in the foreseeable future. One notable success in the current bull market has been the performance of artificial intelligence technology as an investment theme. AI stocks were among the top performers in 2023, contributing to the market's overall positive trajectory. James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, commented:\xa0"", '“The market’s recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI.”\xa0', ""On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee suggests a more cautious outlook for 2024, anticipating an average year for markets rather than double-digit gains. Concerns include the S&P 500's elevated forward price/earnings ratio and a historically low equity risk premium. Valuations indicate potential sub-par annual stock returns, with estimates pointing to a 4% gain compared to the long-run average of 7%-8%. Analysts' optimistic projections for 2024 U.S. corporate earnings are questioned, with expectations of a tapering in economic growth from 7% to 4%. The market's assumption of a more aggressive Fed rate-cutting stance contrasts with public signals, potentially leading to tighter financial conditions as emergency programs wind down in 2024."", 'Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P.

REG is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results on Feb 8 after the closing bell. The company’s quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Jacksonville, FL-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 0.99% in terms of NAREIT FFO per share. Results reflected healthy leasing activity and a year-over-year improvement in the base rent.Over the trailing four quarters, the company’s FFO per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and met in the remaining quarter, with the average beat being 2.21%. This is depicted in the graph below:', 'Regency Centers Corporation price-eps-surprise | Regency Centers Corporation Quote', 'Per a report from CBRE Group CBRE, the U.S. overall retail availability rate hit a record-low 4.7% at year-end, down 10 basis points (bps) quarter over quarter and 31 bps year over year. Among the categories, the neighborhood, community & strip center segment tightened the most. This property type continues to experience positive net absorption, with the fourth quarter net absorption of 12.5 million square feet, bringing the 2023 annual total to 40 million square feet.There is a dearth of supply, and elevated construction costs and interest rates are likely to continue to keep new supply in check. Fourth-quarter and full-year construction completions of 5.3 million and 27 million square feet, respectively, marked record lows. The average asking rent was up by 0.8% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the year to $23.76 per square foot, and both the growth rates were higher than their 10-year averages, per the CBRE report.', 'Regency enjoys a portfolio of high-quality open-air shopping centers in affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas of the United States with compelling demographics. With more people continuing to move to the suburbs due to post-pandemic migration and the hybrid work setup, Regency’s suburban shopping center portfolio is expected to have benefited.In a healthy retail real estate environment in the fourth quarter, we expect the company to have witnessed decent leasing activity, aiding occupancy rates at its properties.Additionally, 80% of REG’s portfolio comprises grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven by nature. The company also has a good tenant mix, with several industry-leading grocers. This is likely to have helped the company generate stable rental revenues during the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for REG’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $350.56 million, indicating an increase of 11.46% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for the company’s lease income for the quarter is pegged at $314.32 million, which calls for an increase from $305.19 in the prior-year quarter.Furthermore, Regency, continuing with its asset-base expansion, closed the earlier announced acquisition of a neighborhood center, The Longmeadow Shops, in Longmeadow, MA, expanding its footprint of high-quality shopping centers in premier suburban trade areas with compelling demographics. The Longmeadow Shops is a premier shopping and dining destination within the trade area, encompassing 100,000 square feet of space that is currently 100% leased.However, higher e-commerce adoption and a high interest rate environment are expected to have cast a pall on the company’s quarterly performance to some extent. Also, higher interest expenses during the quarter are likely to have been a spoilsport.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly FFO per share has remained unrevised at $1.02 over the past month. However, the figure implies growth of 4.08% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.For 2023, Regency Centers projected its NAREIT FFO per share in the range of $4.13-$4.15. This is backed by the company’s projection for the same-property NOI (excluding termination fees) of +/-1.5%.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is pegged at $4.15. The figure indicates an 8.36% increase year over year on 9.20% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.34 billion.', 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Regency this season.

(NYSE:EL) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.66 per share on the 15th of March. This means the annual payment will be 1.9% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', 'If it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Prior to this announcement, the dividend made up 203% of earnings, and the company was generating negative free cash flows. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating free cash flows is a major warning sign for the sustainability of the dividend as these levels are certainly a bit high.', ""Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 45%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated."", ""The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.72 total annually to $2.64. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 14% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Earnings per share has been sinking by 22% over the last five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable."", ""Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

The Logitech (LOGI) and P&G (PG) veteran has pulled off a number of reinventions throughout his career.', 'He will need all those skills, and more.', ""VF Corp.'s stock price sank 9.6% to $15.31 during Wednesday's trading session after another lackluster quarter."", ""The company's market cap has shrunk 76% in the last two years to $5.93 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data."", 'While detailing his latest turnaround strategy to Yahoo Finance, Darrell recalled one experience from his childhood responsible for his drive to learn and look ahead.', '""My dad left when I was 9, and he just left a note on the fireplace on Christmas Eve,"" Darrell told Yahoo Finance on a Zoom call Wednesday from inside the company\'s Denver office. ""I wasn\'t actually ever close to my dad. ... But I was worried about my mom, and she really fell apart. She had four kids. She had polio when she was young. She had four car wrecks and a nervous breakdown that year.""', 'Darrell, who was getting over the flu at the time of the interview, pushed ahead with a look inside his well-honed leadership philosophy.', '""She would come home after her first class at night, and she would second-guess everything,"" he continued.

And everything back there is just to learn [about] your life [from] here on forward.\'""', 'To fix VF Corp., which owns household-name apparel brands including The North Face, Vans, and Timberland, Darrell has to acknowledge a past full of miscues while also moving to quickly chart a new future.', 'People that Yahoo Finance talked to for this story who have interacted with Darrell in the past year universally think he is the right leader at the right time for the 125-year-old outerwear maker. They pointed to his quick decision making, willingness to listen to new ideas, and reluctance to force-feed a leadership agenda down the throats of VF Corp. lifers.', 'His turnaround of mouse, keyboard, and webcam company Logitech and, prior to that, Old Spice at P&G have earned him a lot of early goodwill on the Street.', '""He comes across as someone who appreciates that this business needs to be stabilized,"" BMO Capital Markets senior analyst Simeon Siegel told Yahoo Finance. ""The balance sheet needs to be deleveraged. And that\'s the answer. The answer is not finding a way to infinite growth.""', 'However, these same sources acknowledged that Darrell is up against several formidable forces in his bid to transform VF Corp. into a nimbler, more profitable retailer.', 'The first is a company history of going big on dealmaking at almost any cost, often encouraged by growth-hungry Wall Street.', ""VF Corp.'s former CEOs of the past 20 years, Mackey McDonald, Eric Wiseman, and the most recent predecessor, Steve Rendle, all had transformative acquisitions during their tenures."", 'McDonald plunked down $396 million for skater lifestyle brand Vans in 2004.

But Darrell was hesitant to say when the skater culture-led Vans will return to growth."", ""On the company's earnings call late Tuesday, Darrell took things a step further by announcing a strategic portfolio review. In retail, that often equates to the sell-off of a host of lagging brands to maximize shareholder value."", ""Darrell also didn't shoot down the notion of a more extensive slimming down when speaking with Yahoo Finance, and didn't rule out a potential sale of boot-hawking legend Timberland."", '""I think that\'s kind of a fundamental question of ownership: Should we be in it?"" Darrell said of the portfolio review, adding that Timberland is a ""fantastic"" brand.', ""Sources told Yahoo Finance that these efforts, from cost cuts to asset sales, will help immediately address concerns about VF Corp.'s roughly $5.2 billion in debt that was built up during its decades-long acquisition spree."", '""He has to get this debt down for investors to feel more comfortable,"" a source said.', '""This is the first time I\'ve run a company that had debt,"" Darrell said.

So I don\'t want to be worried about money — and I\'m not worried about money here. ... We\'re going to break down that debt.""', ""Other headwinds for VF Corp. weighed on the company's financial performance over the last two years. The company has faced prolonged traffic weakness at US department stores and lost touch with consumer wants in the Vans division. Meanwhile, another force of nature — warm weather stunting demand for outerwear — hasn't helped."", ""These challenges were front and center in the company's most recent quarter. Sales fell in every one of VF Corp.'s divisions. Vans led the decline with a steep 28% sales drop. Timberland sales declined by 21%, The North Face fell by 10%, and Dickies decreased by 16%."", 'The company lost $32.2 million on an operating basis in the quarter, which incorporated $50.9 million in severance charges and $257.1 million in goodwill impairment charges for Timberland and Dickies.', '""I\'m just really excited about the future,"" Darrell told Yahoo Finance, ""and I don\'t get too caught up in anything that has happened.""', ""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Presenting on the call with me today are President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Fisher; and Senior Vice President of Operations, Mike Lacy; Senior Officers, Andrew Cantor and Chris Van Ens will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.To begin, for this quarter's call, we enhanced how we communicate our outlook for the year ahead. The volatility we have experienced over the last 5 years, combined with the supply-induced challenges our industry is expected to face in 2024 translate into a wider range of potential outcomes for this year versus our typical year. As such, in conjunction with our earnings release, we published an outlook presentation that highlights these potential outcomes and their drivers. Our prepared remarks aligned with the presentation, and those on our webcast should see the slides on your screen. We will resume our usual format of prepared remarks only on future earnings calls.Moving on, key takeaways from our press release and our 2024 outlook are summarized on Slide 4 of the deck. These are first, Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 FFOA per share and same-store results met the guidance expectations set forth on our Third Quarter call. Full year 2023 same-store NOI growth of 6.8% was particularly strong and one of the highest amongst our peer group. Second, based upon consensus estimates, we expect that economic growth and apartment demand will remain resilient in 2024, but historically high new supply will continue to lay on our core growth. Third, ongoing investments in innovation will continue to drive incremental NOI growth above the broader market in 2024, Mike Lacy will give you greater detail on this subject. Fourth, we are maintaining a capital-light strategy given our still elevated cost of capital, but we will take advantage of opportunities when appropriate.For example, in 2023, we executed roughly $1 billion of accretive deals through joint venture and operating partnership unit opportunities. We will continue to keep our eyes open for external growth and feed our cost of capital signals. And fifth, our balance sheet remains well positioned to fully fund our capital needs in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe."", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Thank you, Tom. The topics I will cover today include our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 results, including recent trends and transactions, the 2024 macro outlook that drives our full year guidance, and the building blocks of our 2024 guidance. First, beginning with Slide 5. Our Fourth Quarter and Full Year FFO as Adjusted per share of $0.63 and $2.47 achieved the midpoint of our previously provided guidance ranges. On the bottom half of the slide, you can see that during the quarter, we shifted to a more defensive operating strategy and build occupancy going into 2024. Occupancy trended sequentially higher for each month during the Fourth Quarter, resulting in a 20 basis point sequential improvement versus that of the Third Quarter.As anticipated, this occupancy pivot resulted in lower blended base rate growth versus original 4Q expectations, but it was the right decision to place our portfolio in a position of strength given elevated new multifamily supply in 2024. For January, operating trends have improved. Market rent growth turned sequentially positive and is following normal seasonal patterns thus far. Blended lease rate growth improved to positive 0.2% with new lease rate growth of minus 3.6% and renewal lease rate growth of plus 4%. Concessionary activity continued to trend lower, and occupancy increased further to 97.2%. One month does not make a trend, but we are encouraged by these results.Moving on, as detailed on Slide 6, during the quarter, we executed a variety of transactions that both enhance our liquidity and set us up well for future accretive growth. These include: number one, our joint venture with LaSalle acquired a 262 home community in Suburban Boston, were approximately $114 million at an initial mid- to high 5% yield. Through platform initiatives and various fees, we expect the stabilized yield to be in the mid- to high 6% range to UDR. We continue to explore investment opportunities with LaSalle, which will provide scale-oriented efficiencies to our operations, expand our fee income, and drive future earnings accretion and enhanced ROE for our shareholders.Number two, we sold our (inaudible) on $180 million of dispositions. These are expected to be executed at a weighted average buyer cap rate in the mid-5% range and further enhance our already strong liquidity. And three, we assumed a DCP developer's ownership interest in a distressed Oakland asset. 1.5 years old community was appraised at $67 million or $387,000 per unit, which resulted in a noncash investment loss of approximately $24 million to UDR. The community is still in lease-up and a submarket of Oakland were 2- to 3-month concessions or the norm. The initial yield on the assumed asset is in the mid-3% range. However, once stabilized, we expect the yield to be in the low 5% range.Turning to Slide 7 and our macro outlook. As in years past, utilize top-down and bottom-up approaches to set our 2024 macro and fundamental forecast. Our 2024 market rent growth forecast of roughly 1% was informed by third-party forecast and consensus expectations for a variety of economic factors that drive market run growth and our internal forecasting models, we combined this top-down forecast with a bottom-up growth estimate built by our regional teams as they best understand local supply and the demand dynamics in their markets. Our 1% market rent growth forecast for 2024 is slightly conservative when compared to prominent third-party forecaster estimates at 1.7% and is driven by stable to positive demand set against historically high multifamily deliveries and the expectation for continued elevated concessions.As Mike will discuss, the approximately 1% rent growth ties to our assumption for 2024 blended lease rate growth. Primary variables to our forecast include GDP growth, employment and wage growth, changes to the homeownership rate, supply and its impact on pricing, economic uncertainty. Turning to Slide 8. If we step back and consider the near to intermediate-term outlook for the industry, we remain encouraged by a variety of key supply and demand metrics. First, at the top left, our consumer remains resilient with rent-to-income ratios at the long-term average. Second, at the top right, relative affordability versus alternative housing options remains decidedly in our favor at roughly 50% less expensive to rent than own, a 20% improvement from pre-COVID.This supports a stable to declining homeownership rate and absent a major correction in home prices or a significantly more accommodated long-term interest rate environment, we do not expect this dynamic to change near term. Third, at the bottom left, the latest census data indicates that the largest U.S. a cohorts remain in their prime renter years. This should provide continued support for future long-term rental demand. And fourth, at the bottom right, while multifamily deliveries are expected to remain elevated through at least 2024, starts activity is significantly retreated and is down 70% from recent highs, and is now well below historical averages. This should benefit outer-year growth absent a near-term change in financing costs.Moving on to Slide 9. Third-party data providers are forecasting record multifamily deliveries for the U.S. and in our markets over the next 4 to 6 quarters. Based on completion forecast, peak deliveries are currently expected to occur in the middle of 2024 before trending downwards, closer to long-term historical averages in the second half of 2025. We are cognizant that there will be supply slippage as they move to 2024, and that lease-up concessions could remain elevated after new deliveries update. Positively, peak deliveries in the coming quarters are not materially above the levels we have seen in the second half of 2023, and into the start of 2024. When market level concessions move throughout 2024 will be a primary driver of our ability to capitalize on our market rent growth forecast.On Slide 10, we provide more context on which regions and markets are expected to feel the greatest impact of 2024 supply. The Sunbelt is forecast to face significantly higher absolute deliveries than the coastal markets, although all regions will face higher relative supply in 2024 as compared to their long-term averages. As is evident on the bottom of the page, this dynamic is reflected at the market level, with Sunbelt market supply growth rates expected to be more pressured than coastal markets this year. Mixing this all together, we arrived at our 2024 guidance, which is summarized on Slide 11. Primary expectations include full year FFOA per share guidance of $2.36 to $2.48, same-store revenue, expense expectations that translate to NOI growth ranging from negative 1.75% to positive 1.75%.Slide 12 shows the building blocks for our full year 2024 FFOA per share guidance at the $2.42 midpoint, representing a 2% year-over-year decrease. Drivers include a $0.07 increase of same-store revenue and lease-up income from recently developed communities, offset by a $0.07 decrease from same-store expenses. A $0.025 decrease on DCP activities due to a lower average investment balance in 2024, including a potential $0.02 impact from assuming ownership of a DCP development, dependent on the refinancing of its senior construction loan. While the developer continues to advance refinancing discussions, we have chosen to take a conservative approach by including the downside scenario in our guidance.We expect to have clarity on the refinancing by the second quarter and do not see additional 2024 earnings risk from our DCP investments at this time. Continuing with the building blocks, and approximately $0.02 decrease from interest expense due to higher average interest rates and the expiration of certain hedges and an approximately $0.01 decrease in G&A, reflective of inflationary wage growth. Moving on to Slide 13, and specific to the first quarter, our FFOA per share guidance range is $0.60 to $0.62 or an approximately 3% sequential decrease at the midpoint. This is driven by a [$0.015] decrease of same-store NOI, primarily due to higher expenses attributable to seasonal trends and approximately a $0.05 decrease of higher interest expense and G&A.Last, on Slide 14, we present our debt maturity schedule and liquidity. Only 13% of our total consolidated debt matures through 2026. The thereby reducing future refinancing risk, combined with roughly $1 billion of line capacity, minimal committed capital, our projected first quarter disposition and strong free cash flow, our balance sheet sits in an excellent position. In all, despite near-term macro and potential DC-related headwinds in 2024. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain in excellent shape. We remain opportunistic in our capital deployment, and we continue to utilize a variety of capital allocation better advantages to drive long-term accretion. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike."", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Thanks, Joe. Today, I'll cover the following topics. How our 2023 results and other drivers factor into the building blocks of our full year 2024 same-store revenue growth guidance, an update on our various innovation initiatives, expectations for operating trends across our regions and our outlook for same-store expense growth. Turning to Slide 15. The primary building blocks of our 2024 same-store revenue growth guidance include our embedded earn-in from 2023 lease rate growth, our blended lease rate growth expectations for full year 2024, and contributions from our innovation and other operating initiatives. Starting with our 2024 earn-in of 70 basis points or about half of our normalized historical average, the 20 basis point increase in average occupancy we achieved during the fourth quarter of 2023 came at the expense of some rate growth, which reduced our earnings by approximately 30 basis points versus what I spoke to on the third quarter call.We believe this is prudent, defensive trade given the elevated new supply outlook in many of our markets. Next, portfolio blended lease rate growth is forecast to be approximately 70 basis points in 2024. Given a midyear convention, rate growth should add about 35 basis points to our same-store revenue growth this year. Our expectation is that blends will be lighter through the first half of 2024 before marginally improving during the second half of the year. This dynamic, if accurate, means that blended growth should have less of a positive impact on 2024, but more impactful to our 2025 growth. Underlying our blended rate growth forecast, our assumptions of approximately 3% renewal rate growth in 2024 and approximately negative 1.5% new lease rate growth.As a reminder, even during recessionary periods, we have seen approximately 2% renewal rate growth on average, which, combined with recent trends, provides support for those assumptions. Lastly, we expect the combination of occupancy and bad debt to be roughly flat in 2024. Moving on, innovation and other operating initiatives are expected to add approximately 45 basis points to our 2024 same-store revenue growth, which equates to $5 million to $10 million. The bulk of this growth should come from the continued rollout of our property-wide WiFi, other property enhancements such as the addition of package lockers as well as improved retention and less fraud. For retention, our guidance assumes that our 2024 resident turnover will be 200 basis points below that of 2023.Half of this comes from the easier first half comp. As you may remember, long-term delinquent skips and evictions were elevated through the first half of 2023. We do not anticipate this repeating in 2024 as we have seen long-term delinquent activity stabilize. The other 100 basis point improvement should come from our proprietary customer experience project, which helps us improve our resident experience throughout their time with UDR, thereby improving their probability of renewal. We have seen the early benefits of this initiative with resident retention higher on a year-over-year basis for 9 consecutive months. For every 100 basis points of improved retention or reduced turnover, approximately $3 million drops to our bottom line.We believe our customer experience project will continue to improve our turnover and expand our operating margin advantage relative to peers. Regarding fraud, we are implementing a variety of AI-based screening measures process improvements and credit threshold reviews to enhance our upfront resident screening. Given the resident-friendly legislation, we continue to see throughout our portfolio, minimizing the potential for bad debt before it gets in the front door is critical. Rolling all this up, our 2024 same-store revenue guidance range from 0% to 3%, with a midpoint of 1.5%. The 3% high end of our same-store revenue growth range is achievable to improve year-over-year occupancy, additional accretion from innovation, and blended lease rate growth that occurs more ratably throughout the year or at a higher level than our initial forecast.Conversely, the low end of 0% reflects full year blended lease rate growth of approximately negative 2%. And some level of occupancy loss and delayed income recognition from our innovation initiatives. Turning to Slide 16 and our regional revenue growth expectations, we expect the coast will continue to perform better than the Sunbelt in 2024, led by the East Coast. The East Coast, which comprises approximately 40% of our NOI is forecast to grow same-store revenue by 1% to 4%. We expect Boston, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia to each deliver full year same-store revenue growth of at least 2%. Signs of recent softening in demand in New York, leave us slightly more cautious on that market.The West Coast, which comprised of approximately 35% of our NOI is forecast to grow same-store revenue by 0% to 3%. Orange County, Los Angeles, and the Monterey Peninsula are expected to produce upper tier growth, while San Francisco, San Diego, and Seattle are forecast to be softer. Last, our Sunbelt markets, which comprise roughly 25% of our NOI, our forecast to grow same-store revenue by negative 2% to positive 1%. Austin, Nashville, Denver, and Orlando are scheduled to see some of the highest levels of new supply in which should continue to pressure pricing power. On a relative basis, we expect Dallas and Tampa to be leaders among our Sunbelt markets.Moving on, as shown on Slide 17, a we expect 2024 same-store expense growth of 5.25% at the midpoint. This is primarily driven by growth in real estate taxes, personnel, and insurance. While only 6% of total expenses, insurance expense growth of 16% to 20% reflects the premium increase we realized when our policy was renewed in December. In terms of year-over-year expense growth guidance, the first quarter should be elevated due to a onetime $3.7 million employee retention credit we realized at the beginning of 2023. This has the effect of increasing total first quarter 2024 same-store expense growth by more than 300 basis points. Additionally, for full year 2024, the costs associated with our property-wide Wi-Fi initiative amount to an incremental $2 million.Absent these 2 factors, we would expect normalized same-store expense growth to be in the low 4% range throughout the year or approximately 120 basis points lower than our full year midpoint. In closing, while the near-term operating environment presents some challenges, we continue to innovate with the intention of increasing revenue growth, improving resident retention, and further expanding our operating margin over time. I thank our teams for their collaboration and eagerness to leverage new and innovative tools to drive superior results. I will now turn over the call to Tom."", 'Thomas W. Toomey', ""Thank you, Mike, and as summarized on Slide 18. When we consider our potential 2024 growth trajectory, I come back to the key components of running a successful business. First is to understand your customer. Our residents have healthy rent-to-income ratios and relative affordability continues to favor apartments over other forms of housing. So we view the effect of elevated supply as transitory and expect that the demand versus supply dynamics will revert to our favor sometime after 2024. In terms of resident satisfaction, we can measure success through our customer experience initiatives and how they translate into greater retention, which has improved for 9 consecutive months. We expect this trend to continue. The second component is the understanding of your associates. Through frequent discussions, surveys, and town halls, we have created an open dialogue and a culture that fosters engagement and innovation.UDR is proud and recognized leader in corporate responsibility as well. And third characteristic is to listen to investors. We are highly engaged, conducting roughly 500 investor calls, meetings each year. We are confident that we have a good read on what investors think we are doing well. and where we can improve. From these interactions, we have created a company we believe is a full cycle investment and maximize value creation for our stakeholders regardless of the economic outlook. In 2024, we plan to focus on what we can control, namely, this means leaning into our operating platform and innovation, developing talent, nimbly adjusting our operating strategy in the face of supply and taking a capital-wide approach to maintain liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. Taken together, we believe we can successfully navigate whatever macro environment we face moving forward. With that, I'll open it up to Q&A. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citibank.', 'Eric Wolfe', ""Can you walk us through the math on how you get to the $0.025 of dilution from taking ownership of the 2 DCP assets? And I think in the past, you've talked about a third asset that might see a similar outcome. So just help us understand if there's likely any incremental impact beyond what's in the 2024 guide."", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Eric, it's Joe. Maybe some quick math on the $0.025, and then I'll kind of take you through some of that remaining DCP risk and how we approach that. So as I think we kind of mentioned upfront, there is a Philly asset that I'll get into that has a binary outcome coming up in 2Q related to its refinancing, which right now is in process and discussing with lenders. But if that were to not be refinanced and we were to take ownership of that asset, we'd effectively be moving from a high-yield DCP investment to a lower-yield acquisition, which naturally results in some dilution. So that's about $0.02 of that number that shifts the whole range down, including at the midpoint.So if that refinancing did occur in theory, the entire range would shift right back up by $0.02. The rest of that has to do with we took ownership of (inaudible), as we mentioned there in the release, it has a little bit of dilution to it. In addition, we've got an assumption in there that we have roughly $75 million of payoffs in the back half as we have some of these deals that are opening into their prepayment window and it may make sense for them economically to go out and refinance with a cheaper cost of capital. And so you get a little bit of drag from that as well, offset by continued accruals on the rest of the portfolio.So it's kind of the puts and takes on the $0.025. As it relates to getting into the rest of the portfolio, we walked through (inaudible), I think everybody understands kind of what took place there. When we go into these deals, you really have 3 primary areas of risk that we're trying to underwrite One is the upfront kind of cost and delay and timing aspect of any development. Two is going to be the cash flow perspective, what's going to take place on rents and the supply in any given market, and three, just the capital markets component, what happens with interest rates, cap rates and capital availability. And so that's kind of the 3 main areas we're trying to underwrite when we go into these.Clearly, any one of those factors is not going to be enough to drive distress on any of these deals. But when you kind of get a couple of them that stack up, you do run into a little bit more distress, which is really what happened with (inaudible). I think everybody is pretty familiar with what happened in NorCal since pre-Covid, rents still being down and then downtown Oakland, perhaps one of the worst submarkets in that respect, with rents still down 30-plus percent. And so we did take the keys back on that asset as the developer didn't want to continue to support the cash flow shortfalls. That said, as we continue through lease up and hopefully burn off the concessions in the next couple of years, you see it in the presentation, getting to a more palatable yield here in the next couple of years.As it relates to the Philly asset that I mentioned, a couple of those same risks not to the same degree, but a challenged market in downtown or City Center Philadelphia from a supply and concession perspective. And so that NOI has been a little bit weaker. We did have some delays coming through COVID on that development. But as I mentioned, that development partner is in process with a couple of different lenders, just trying to make sure that they can get it to the finish line on proceeds and terms, but we felt it prudent to take perhaps a more conservative approach and put the risk out there to the street. Beyond that, you mentioned what else is out there. So you kind of got 12 other assets, roughly $475 million of outstanding balance of those 12 when we go through the stress testing and scenarios, just 3 of those are what we would consider watch list and the balances on those 3 are plus or minus $50 million.So only about 10% of the rest of the book. They don't have the same degree of risk that the first to do, but they are on our watch list for varying reasons, they don't have maturities come up until '25 and '26. So we do have a little bit of time there, unless, of course, the developer partner decides not to continue making payments. So if we did have to take those back, that's really plus or minus $0.01 of risk over time. We don't see all 3 obviously have in near term and/or potentially even longer term. Beyond that, you get into the rest of the book of the business, the other $400-plus million that's out there. Most of these are in their lease-up and/or stabilization process. So we've got pretty good visibility on rents and NOI, which, at this time, the rest of those are in line to above pro forma expectations. And so we feel pretty good about the rest of that book of business."", 'Eric Wolfe', ""That's very helpful. And then maybe just quickly, the Oakland property, Lake Merritt, I guess, why not just try to sell it, take the small loss. You mentioned some of the struggles in Northern California. So I guess the question is why sort of increase your exposure there versus just selling it today, putting into more accretive uses in the near term?"", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Yes. So I think the valuation, obviously, a third-party appraisal there that dictated that noncash impairment. But when you look at where we're at today on that asset, we are taking it over, and we do think there's quite a bit of upside be it through real estate tax resets, other income, obviously, burning off concessions and getting it stabilized. So it's probably better value in our hands than bringing it to the market right now where, clearly, in Northern California as a whole and Oakland specifically from a transaction market perspective pretty challenged, given some of the risks out there. So I'm not sure you optimize price and value by simply trying to liquidate. I think it's better to keep it in our operations team's hands for a couple of years and then evaluate down the road when the market is a little bit better."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Austin Todd Wurschmidt', ""Mike, you guys averaged 60 basis points of blended lease rate growth in the second half of last year. And you mentioned the 70 basis point lease rate growth assumption in guidance assumes lower growth in the first half of this year and then kind of picks up a little bit in the back half. Is it fair to say that you think that lease rate growth bottoms in the first half of '24, and we see continued improvement in the back half and then into 2025?"", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Austin, thanks for the question. Yes, I think what you can expect to see is the first half is going to look very similar to the back half of last year. So that 60 basis points first half is where we expect things to track today. As of right now, the second half is closer to 1% on blends. And I'll tell you what we've been -- we promised to see the -- where we're at today just in terms of blends. If you look at December to January, you can see it in our deck. We went a 150 basis point increase, and a lot of that has to do with our strategy. .And you've heard us talk about this before, but we tend to operate closer to 5% to 7%, we're able to drive our occupancy closer to 97.2% in January. Again, that put us in a better position today to start driving our rents. We're seeing some promising trends. We don't want to call that things are significantly better -- as we have to get through some more of the leasing season. But to start the year, things are starting off a little better than we expected."", 'Austin Todd Wurschmidt', ""Great. So it sounds like the lease rate growth should inflect, I guess, comparing spreads year-over-year in the back half of this year. The Sunbelt markets have been kind of the most challenging for your portfolio. And I'm just wondering sort of how that stacks up versus the portfolio overall this year and how you're thinking about inflection or further deterioration across the markets that you're in? Just any detail you can provide on how you're thinking about the cadence for that 25%, 30% of the portfolio."", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Yes, Austin. That's another really good question. We put a good slide in here, Page 16, that walks just where we expect East Coast to perform against the West Coast as well as the Sunbelt. And I'd tell you that even though the Sunbelt we're definitely facing higher supply and that's playing out in some of our expectations for the year. We're coming off a very strong year. And we compare ourselves on a relative basis within the markets against our different peers. And I can tell you, the teams are proud of what they were able to accomplish. And we're off to a good start for this year as well. .I think a lot of this has to do with what we expect with supply that we're facing here over the next 4 quarters or so. But on top of that, it's still relatively strong job growth. We're still seeing wage growth in that area. So we're seeing pretty positive absorption. And for us, what's interesting when you think about what we put on Page 15, and we break down our earn-in versus our expectation from blends and other income. Other income is expected to make up about 45 basis points of our total revenue at the portfolio level for the Sunbelt. That's double. So a lot of things that we've been working on as it relates to rolling out our WiFi, for example, that's starting to pay dividends, and that's what's translating to positive relative performance against our peers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Bradley Barrett Heffern', ""Occupancy in January was about 50 basis points above the '23 level, but guidance assumes flat occupancy. So I'm just curious is the expectation that you plan to trade that occupancy for rent growth in the spring? Or is that just a conservative assumption?"", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""It's a good catch, Brad. We're starting to see that today. So again, we wanted to build our occupancy in a period of time where our lease expirations are the lowest. It allows you to just push your occupancy up. And then as you move into the leasing season, you can start to get more aggressive as leases start to turn. And so the 97.2% is probably a high mark for us. I think as we move through the quarter, we expect that to come down closer to 97%, maybe even the high 96% range and continue to test our blends. And from all you can see is that rate of change from December to January. Again, very positive momentum, a lot of that is on the new lease side. So we had negative 5.6% new lease growth in December. January was negative 3.6%. February, it's only 7 days in. So it's probably too early to call, but things are promising, and it looks like it's trending upwards."", 'Bradley Barrett Heffern', 'Okay. And then how are you treating the DCP book going forward as you take back assets and redemptions come in? Do you plan to shrink the book just based on recent experience? Or do you plan to reinvest in DCP and kind of keep it at the same size that it always was?', 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""I think naturally, you're going to see a little bit of potential shrinkage. Embedded in guidance, we mentioned that binary outcome there with that Philadelphia asset, which if we were to take that back, that's plus or minus $100 million balance. So that would bring it down to $475 million. And then we mentioned that we have about $75 million of assumed redemptions in the back half of the year. So you could see that balance flow down, which near term is a little bit dilutive. That said, I don't think there's any desire to continue to shrink beyond that. I think the hope is that as we get some of those paybacks we find opportunities to continue to redeploy into either on the traditional DCP side or the recap side.That said, it's kind of a double-edged sword in terms of -- we're not seeing a lot of opportunities out there in that space right now, but that speaks to the fact that starts have dropped off to kind of annualized 200,000 unit level. So not a lot of developers out there starts today. But I do think over time, you'll see us continue to pivot between that, between acquisitions, redevelopment, development as it makes sense. But I wouldn't expect it to continue to shrink much beyond that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.', 'Joshua Dennerlein', ""Mike, I just want to explore your guidance assumption for 3% renewal rate growth in 2024. Are there specific markets driving that lower? Or is there just some kind of split the difference between conservatism I think you said recessions are 2% versus maybe more normal years, it's closer to 4%, just trying to engage in where you guys are coming from?"", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Yes. Good question. I'll tell you, just as we think about renewals and new leases in general, just as we started the year, you can see our renewals started to come down closer to that 4% range. And it feels to be a pretty comfortable we're still spending on that 3.5% to 4% as we move forward over the next 2 months or so. Our expectations are with seasonality picking up even though we're facing supply, typically, your market rents start to pick up as well. So if we can continue to see our new lease growth continue to improve. You're going to see that, that spread between new and renewal is in a more healthy range. And then we can start testing our renewals again as we move forward. But as it relates to just regional performance, there's not a big difference typically between the Sunbelt versus the East Coast, West Coast, usually in that range of, call it, 2, 2.5 to all the way up to around 5% on renewals, but it's pretty tight overall."", 'Joshua Dennerlein', 'Okay. And then maybe just one follow-up on that. Does that imply the second half renewals like 2.5% or the spreads 2.5?', 'Michael D. Lacy', ""They're pretty consistent right now. Our playbook is around 3% for the year. And again, when we send out 3.5% to 4% we typically negotiate on 25% to 30% of our renewals, and it's usually in that 50 basis point range. So I feel comfortable at least in the foreseeable future in the first couple of quarters with that range. And we'll see what happens with market rent. And again, if we can test the waters and push rent renewals back up, we will."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.', 'James Colin Feldman', ""So I guess just thinking about Slide 10, more than 250 basis points above historic average markets. I mean, how do you even guide in those markets right now? I mean, what do you -- like what gives you -- can you just talk about how you think about visibility in terms of like where rents could really go? What gives you comfort giving any kind of numbers on those, whether it's historic cycles or maybe the numbers you're seeing from third parties or however else you're thinking about it. Really, just a question on kind of visibility in the highest supply markets."", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Jamie, it's Joe. Maybe I'll start off and Michael will come in behind me here. But I do think, to your point, on the visibility. When you look at the deliveries that we were facing kind of in the back half of '23 and here to start this year, there really isn't a material difference between deliveries that we are facing at that point in time versus what we expect to face as we get in the middle of the year. It goes a little bit higher as we kind of get into 2Q, 3Q, but it's really not a big change. So the fact that we are already facing kind of a run rate delivery schedule during a typically seasonally weak period of time, and we're putting up the results that we did in terms of blends and renewals and the traffic that we saw and we were able to drive occupancy.That gives you some conviction as we go into a seasonally stronger period of time, and we have seen concessions come back a little bit. We're seeing good traffic the pricing power to start the year is off to a good start in terms of pushing rents up on a month-over-month basis. It gives you some conviction that maybe not the worst is behind us, but at least we're finding a little bit of a floor here as we move into the year. So it helps a little bit in that approach to those high supply markets."", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""If I could just add. I think for us, we spend a lot of time doing both a top-down and a bottom-up approach and whether it's coming from the field and they're telling us how the supply is impacting them directly versus all of our third-party data that we're able to look at here in Denver, we triangulate around a range of outcomes, and that's why we've provided that by region here and again, we feel pretty good to start the year and we'll see how it plays out, especially as it relates to moving into the leasing season."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. That's very helpful. And then a big week for headlines in terms of distressed and commercial real estate, [KRF] guides, all kinds of stories out there. What are you guys seeing now in terms of merchant stress you think it will present even more opportunities than you originally thinking for the year? And any change in merchant developer behavior on concessions as you're starting to see more things seem to have issues?"", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Jamie, it's Joe. I guess maybe just stepping back first as you think about the sector versus broader commercial real estate. I do think it's important to think about multifamily, maybe a little bit differently than some of the headlines that are out there. A lot of that bank stress revolves around other sectors because the reality is that when we have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the multifamily space, they do take the majority of the financing for our space. And so the banks end up having to go heavy some of those sometimes more risk factors. So you got to delineate between those 2 to start and the fact that in a needs-based business, but plenty of capital still flowing through it or wanting to flow into it, you typically don't see that same level of distress within multi.So I think I'd keep with a little bit of what we've talked about in the past, which you'll see some distressed developers for sure. So to the extent that you have pro forma NOIs that are below expectations, obviously, higher interest rates and cap rates or delays, as we talked about earlier, you are going to see some of these developers that feel distress just like on this Modera Lake Merritt deal that we are talking about. That said, do you see distressed pricing on the other side is another discussion, and with well-priced capital from the GSEs and availability of that capital, yes, you're still seeing quite a big demand for multifamily. Andrew Cantor and team just spent a ton of time out at NMHC, meeting with a lot of different partners, brokers, capital providers. And I'd say the general consensus was cap rates plus or minus 5% at this point in time. There's still going to be a little bit of a meeting of the minds with some of the risks that are out there between buyers and sellers. But it still seems like we're in that plus or minus 5% cap world. So that really doesn't feel like distress, I'd say, as a buyer."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. If I could just ask a follow-up on that. I mean when you think about your debt lending business and your preferred lending business, and you look at the impairments you've taken or some of the projects you're talking about, I mean, is part of the story, like you just don't get great deals even in distressed moments. I mean, does it make you rethink at all some of the other ways you're investing beyond just development and clearly very strong core operating skill set just because there's so much capital that does want to be in this space?"", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""I don't think it makes us rethink the suite of options that we have. I think that's one of the powers of the platform, obviously, in terms of diversification of markets but also diversification of ways we've been deploying capital. We're really not a one-trick pony. And so I don't think it changes at all our thoughts on what we continue to deploy into DCP like investments. Those over time have provided solid returns for us. It's a good way to pivot at certain points of time when other capital decisions may not make sense. So I really don't see that being a pivot for us. We'll continue to go into all forms of capital."", 'Thomas W. Toomey', ""Jamie, this is Toomey. I might just add, what's interesting, everybody can find 1 or 2 deals that have distress. And we highlighted the path that creates a lot of that distress. And you've gotten slightly a (inaudible) in the last 90 days with rates coming down 100 bps. That certainly helped. But when you say the scale of distress, what my experience is, is there's a lot of people with a lot bigger capital capabilities than ours and even in the public arenas to write large checks for significant signature bank, for example. Lot of distress inside of that entity with real estate. And it was never offered up, no one ever got a hard look at it. So the range of distress 1, 2 deals in a market, yes, and they will get picked off, but in mass, no, because of Fannie and Freddie capability as a backstop.And then that leads to significant capital beyond ours that probably can reach and grab should it become entity level-type distress. So we'll be smart and nimble about it program with respect to DCP, not going to be a lot of development activity coming online anytime soon. And the recap market is pretty competitive and a lot of capital. We'll be cautious about any aspect of going back into that. But we're going to keep, as Joe said, all our options open, and see what makes sense on a risk-adjusted against matched against our cost of capital."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', 'Can you talk a little bit about the pace of recovery trending from Northern California and Seattle? And when you look at your Slide 16, you have a top and bottom growth markets on the West Coast as a whole. So how wide is the gap between these cohorts? And then can you just talk a little bit about the trajectory of some of these markets and when we can start to see them improving?', 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Sure, Michael, this is Mike. I'll take a crack at it first. Specific to Seattle, San Francisco area, I'd say first starting with San Francisco. It's good to be diversified. We are 50-50 urban suburban. We've got 50% of our exposure in the SoMa downtown area and then the rest down along the Peninsula, and it covers about 8% of our NOI, team did a really good job last year. I can tell you we expect to be #1 in terms of total revenue growth in that market. So we've been able to do a lot with what we have to work with there. Today, we're sitting around 97%, 97.5% occupancy. We've seen concessions come down as of late, really over the last 30 days or so, and we're starting to drive our rents. And I think specific to your question around trajectory and trends San Francisco is the one market out of all of ours that had the highest momentum. And when I say that, I look at December, for example, our blends were around negative 7%.In January, we're actually flat, so about a 700, 750 basis point increase month-over-month. Again, it's a low lease expiration period of time. So try not to get too excited about it, but we have seen demand pick up there. A lot of that has to do with the city being cleaned up more. You don't have as much supply. So today, San Francisco feels relatively well. Seattle is not too far behind for us, again, a very diversified market. We are all along the suburbs and a lot of exposure to the Bellevue area, where most recently, we've heard that there's about 200-plus thousand square feet of office space being taken out by a TikTok. So more recently, we've seen traffic pick up in that area. I can tell you our blends, just going from December to January increased about 250 basis points, from about 0 to, call it, 2.5%. So that part of the country feels a little bit better today than what we would have expected moving into the year."", 'Michael Goldsmith', ""And then my follow-up is you're including 45 basis points of benefit from innovation and other income in your same-store revenue guidance for the midpoint of -- what are the current opportunities for further revenue generation and cost savings from the platform?"", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Yes, a few things. Let me step back and give you a little bit of color on some of the initiatives we're working on, both on the revenue side and expense side. I mean, for us, you've heard us talk a lot about the customer experience project. And we put in my prepared remarks that we do expect about a 100 basis point improvement in turnover this year from that. That's just the start of it. We just recently armed our teams with a lot of information. They're putting it to use today, and they're starting to question the power of knowing exactly what retention can be and what it will do for them. And I'll give you an example, we went through, call it, 300,000 data points and recognize that you can have a 20% higher retention rate, if you can move people with a negative sentiment, we're more on a bad trajectory to a good trajectory.And again, we use a lot of our proprietary information to score this, whether it's their sentiment scores, their survey scores, service scores or (inaudible) all those together to get an understanding of how we can change those trajectories. Over the last 9 months, we've seen an improvement in turnover. Just by putting a flashlight on this, and specific to the fourth quarter, our turnover was actually 400 basis points better than the historical average. So again, we're just now scratching the surface. We expect a benefit this year, but even more to come in '25 and '26 as it relates to that program. In addition, we talked a little bit about our WiFi rollout. We've got about 20,000 units installed today. We've got another 12,000 coming throughout the year. And so this is going to continue to pay dividends not only this year, but into the future.As of right now, we think that's about a $6 million benefit in incremental revenue in 2024 and more to come in 2025. Aside from that, really excited about our fraud and bad debt detection, starting to utilize more AI around that, just to be able to understand who's coming in, try to block people from getting in the front door. So we're utilizing it in terms of our proof of income as well as our ID verification. And we're starting to see that, that's making a difference for us as well. And as it relates to expenses, we're highly focused on driving that number down. You saw the midpoint of our guidance is around 5.25%. I'd remind the audience that aside from our anniversary-ing off of the CARES Act as well as the WiFi. Our organic growth is probably closer to around 4%. Still after what we can control, trying to drive that number down, some of the things that I can think of off top of my mind are vendor and product consolidation, working with the teams to try to drive that into a more efficient state, more personnel efficiencies and more ROIs around expense savings, where an example is a re-pipe. We can limit some of the insurance costs that are hitting us, and we can also eliminate some of the service requests that we're having to face. So those are just a few examples of things that we can control that we do expect will help us throughout the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.', 'Adam Kramer', ""Just wanted to ask a little bit about the sequential move in January versus December and blended rate growth and I guess, kind of the occupancy build as well. And looking at Slide 9, it looks like there was kind of decent drop-off in 4Q in terms of deliveries in your market. Wondering, did that kind of play a factor in maybe in kind of the January results with the December and January results? And then maybe how you're thinking about kind of, I think, some of the further sequential improvements that you guys kind of talked about here in new lease in February versus January. And kind of in the months going forward relative to the fact that there is kind of that the pre-material step-up in deliveries, it looks like in 2Q, I guess, in 3Q, 24 in your markets?"", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Adam, it's Mike. I'll start and if Joe wants to jump in, he can. Again, for us, we took the stance of trying to drive that occupancy up in the Fourth Quarter. And a lot of that has to do with you just have lower lease expiration. So it's a period of time where you can really get in there and make a difference. And I'll tell you, probably more specific to how we did it. It's not necessarily with the deliveries. I'd say it's more around our focus on retention. And so again, when you look at our turnover, and it's 400 basis points better than what we would have historically experienced during that period of time, we were trying to driver retention up, which obviously helps you with occupancy.Once we're able to build that up in that 97% range, we're able to continue that into January. 97% too again is probably a high mark for us. We're actively bringing that down today. I think February is probably closer to 97% and we're comfortable in the high 96% or 97% range, while testing our rents. And so probably the thing I'd point to the most and probably most excited about is that trajectory. So looking at that rate of change from December of down, call it, negative 1.2, negative 1.3 to 0.2 in January, it's a positive trend. And the fact that a lot of that is coming from new lease growth. It gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward, but very low lease expirations in January, February. So give us a little bit more time to see how this plays out over time."", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Adam, just to kind of close out there on the kind of midyear spike, if you will. What we're showing here on Page 9 is based off third-party forecast. And I think we all kind of know and accept that there's always going to be some degree of slippage, and so even with that spike, you're only running maybe 7,500 units a quarter above where we have been kind of in the back half of last year in terms of this year. So it's not a big number. There will probably be some slippage, but you're having that slippage and that higher delivery schedule into a typically seasonally a better period of time, which we would expect. And when you've got roughly 8 million units in our collective markets and you're only talking about maybe another 7,500 units a quarter. Yes, it really isn't a big number. We're cognizant of the risk it creates, obviously. So -- and given that risk and some others, I think it's appropriate for us to be balanced in our approach and try to be cognizant of that and not get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of what we think could to come on pricing power and guidance."", 'Adam Kramer', ""That's very helpful. Just maybe a quick follow-up. Wondering what the bad debt reserve that you have embedded in guidance. I know you've accounted for this a little bit differently maybe than some of the peers. So maybe just what the bad debt reserve and guidance and then kind of the assumptions around, I guess, where bad debt is today? And then kind of what the assumption is for where it is, I guess, at year-end?"", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Yes. So after kind of a challenging first part of '23 when we had the excessive level of long-term delinquents, the last 6 months of last year really leveled out. So we are pretty consistently getting to, call it, 98.5% collected during that period of time. And that's really our base case assumption as we go into 2024. And so those higher turns that we saw in the first quarter last year those help out in terms of thinking about stress on occupancy, on expenses, on potentially rates. But because we had reserved those individuals at an appropriate level, there's really no year-over-year implications for bad debt. And so we've taken an assumption that we basically stay at the same level. That said, I think Mike started to go into some of those actions that we're taking. And so we haven't really assumed those actions benefit us in terms of who comes in the front door and the possibility of fraud and delinquency.Subsequent to that, be it through kind of those AI-based income and ID verification efforts, we're reevaluating a lot of our deposit and credit thresholds, taking a look at some of our processes related to move-in monies and other aspects to ensure that we continue to try to limit the front door because it really has become a cottage industry in terms of creating fraud and try to get in and take advantage of landlords at this point in time. But for now, flat year-over-year assumption, we hope there's some upside over time."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.', 'John Joseph Pawlowski', 'Joe or Mike, on the -- with respect to the low 5% expense growth guidance, if you double clicked on it, roughly, what would the average Sunbelt market look like in terms of 2024 expense growth expectations?', 'Michael D. Lacy', ""John, they're all pretty close, probably within 100 basis points of each other. We are experiencing a little bit more pressure just on personnel in a place like that, just given the supply. Aside from that, we do have more of our rollout on the WiFi today. So we're incurring that expense. But we're seeing the offset again in other income because that's double of what we're seeing in the portfolio as a whole. So slightly elevated in the Sunbelt, but not materially different."", 'John Joseph Pawlowski', ""Okay. And then just a follow-up to that point, Mike, did I interpret your comments to the Sunbelt has doubled the lift of ancillary income, so call it, 90 bps. And so the range of 1% to negative 2% revenue growth in terms of -- we're just looking for organic market level revenues really closer to 0% to negative 3% in your Sunbelt market. Am I interpreting that math correctly?"", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Yes. I'll give you a little bit more color on our expectations at the midpoint for the Sunbelt. We're coming into the year with, call it, negative 20 bps on our earn-in and that would imply about negative 2% expectations on full year blends, but the contribution from that will be closer to about 100 basis points negative."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Wedbush Securities.', 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""So I find it interesting that the blended number -- excuse me, the renewal number is still 3% or 4% or whatever it is and people are sort of confident that they -- even though they know they can get 2 or 3 months free across the street, they're sticking around, to avoid the inconvenience of moving. And that tells me something about what the swing factor is for your guidance going forward. It really is you got this blob of supply cholesterol on the system that perhaps will go away over the time. But if we get an economy in the future that avoids any kind of material drop-off. Isn't this guidance really sort of realistic in today's present tense view, but also designed to be beaten if we get an economic picture into the middle part of this year that is resilient -- continues to be resilient and so on. So is that the swing factor here to the upside, pure economic activity and the demand side of the equation?"", 'Thomas W. Toomey', ""Rich, this is Toomey. I think you nailed ahead -- nailed it perfectly. It's jobs, okay? We've seen a robust set of numbers and the revisions have been up. we're surprised at the strength of the job market, the people reentering the wage growth side of the equation. And if that were to continue, the absorption of what the supply picture is goes pretty darn smoothly. So I mean, our business starts with jobs. Supply is a (inaudible), if you will, a bump in the road, and we'll get past it. But that's the upside scenario. And I'm not sure anybody has hit the jobs number right in a long time. So we'll see how that plays out. But we're encouraged by where it started off in January and February, as Mike pointed to. -- and hope that, that trend continues, and that would be material revisions to our results. But right now, we're playing it on a consensus as Joe outlined right down the middle."", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""I think to -- Rich, the only thing to add -- Rich, just on your comment there on renewals and why are individuals jump in for those concessions. Keep in mind that those concessions are not a market-wide concession. Those are concessions that you're seeing some developers offer in very distressed submarkets. So maybe 2 to 3 months in certain locations. But when you only have, call it, 2.5% of stock to deliver across our market, that implies a lot of units that aren't offering those distressed levels of concessions. So it's not as if every resident has the opportunity to jump ship, avoid that 3% renewal and go get 3 months. So it creates a little bit of a stickiness, not just the fact that they don't want to move and it's costly to move, but also there's just not that abundance to jump to. And we are starting to see that a little bit.Nobody has asked it yet. But last quarter, we talked a lot about the A versus B continue in terms of in the Sunbelt, some of our B renters jump into As for the concessions. We are starting to see a shift in that dynamic after the last couple of months of seeing concessions start to ratchet down a little bit. We're seeing that continuum start to shift back to a more normalized approach (inaudible) the B renter and staying in the B location."", 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""Okay, cool. And then real quick. What do you make of Camden's market share comment about new households increasingly going the rental route. Obviously, it's much more expensive to own a home in this market. Are you seeing that play out at all in your neck of the woods?"", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Yes. I think Camden and team are spot on that in terms of seeing more of a capture for the rentership side of the equation, be it multi or the single-family rental side. When you have affordability pretty much as distressed as it has been at any point in the last 30, 40 years for single-family. Typically, when you see that, you see the pendulum swing the other way. And so you've started to see signs of that with home ownership rate kind of peaking out to plus or minus 66% over the last year or 2, you start to see that tick down a little bit. So I think on the macro side, definitely agree on that. We expect that to be the case in terms of the macro backdrop for our guidance. And then when you look at what we're actually seeing on the ground, you look at our move-outs to buy activity, it's still significantly below what it used to be. And so we're keeping more and more people in the renter pool, which obviously helps on the retention side and helps on the pricing side. So we're in 100% agreement with Camden on that."", 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""Yes. I mean I get the theory, just wondering if you're seeing it in your numbers and you're saying you are already, which is interesting."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities.', 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""Two quick ones for me. Mike, I wanted to follow up on your comments on San Fran and Seattle. I don't think you mentioned it. So perhaps can you share specifically what concessions you're seeing in those 2 markets today and what you're offering in your own portfolio and then maybe also outline where concessions are being used more broadly and more prevalently in the portfolio?"", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Yes. And thanks for the question. Specific to San Francisco, we were offering around 3 weeks during the quarter, during the fourth quarter. That's actually come down to about half of that range over the last 30 days, and that's where you see it translate into those blends that I mentioned, that 700, 750 basis point pickup from December. A lot of that is just concessions coming down in that market as well as market rents coming up. And it's pretty consistent across the board. I mentioned earlier, we're 50% exposed downtown SoMa area 50% down along the Peninsula, it's pretty consistent across the board. As it relates to Seattle, we haven't really offered concessions there over the last year or so. That's a market where we tend to adjust our market rents more than anything else. And today, we're not offering any concessions."", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""Okay. And back to I think comments you guys have made on capital deployment here. It certainly sounds like there's a conservatism as you wait for perhaps to see better return versus not necessarily not having an interest. So curious if you could talk a bit more about how hurdle rates or hurdles rates have changed here and what you'd need to see to get more active with on (inaudible) and perhaps more DCP deployment."", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""So I guess overarching, our capital deployment strategy is that we still sit in a capital-light mode. Obviously, the cost of debt has dramatically improved in the last 60 to 90 days. Cost of equity has improved a little bit. Asset pricing has probably improved a little bit. So the backdrop clearly getting better, and you continue to take off a little bit of risk at a time in terms of the supply and macro environment as we move throughout the year. So maybe some increased degrees of conviction. But today, I'd say the area that we are most focused on deploying is continue to deploy (inaudible) with our joint venture partner, LaSalle, big props to Andrew and the LaSalle team on that One Upland deal that we got done in the mid- to high 5s initially.With the capital flows we've seen and compression in rates, that deal would clearly trade for a cap rate inside of where we just bought it a few months ago. So we'd like to continue to deploy with them, go out there and get more opportunities. We've put about $150 million at the high end at share within our guidance. So that's the priority today. To the extent that DCP opportunities come along and maybe get some paybacks and we can redeploy. We'll take a look at that, obviously. Development, we've seen a little bit of reprieve in terms of hard cost. They are starting to come down a little bit. And so I'd say on the shovel-ready deals that we have prepared, we're probably in the 5.5% to 6% type range on current NOI and inflated cost I think we'll continue to take a hard look at that as we move throughout the year in terms of when is the appropriate time to start those given the fundamental picture, which, as you go into 25 should be a little bit better than 26 clearly, when you're delivering well below historical levels of supply should be a good year to potentially deliver into. So that's the other piece that we'll be taking a look at as we move through the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Robin Magnus Haneland', 'This is Robin Haneland on for John. I just wanted to touch on the DCP. How many of these are currently on a cash basis versus simply accruing the rate of return to the balance and it looks like a couple of the preferreds were extended, Junction Phase 1 at infield. Was there any particular reason for this?', 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Yes. So in terms of cash pay versus accrual, majority of these, by definition, because they are developments are going to be accrual-based. So just the same way that the senior loan is going to have an interest rate reserve to help fund their portion. We're going to have an accrual on ours and so over time, as those assets migrate to cash flowing and operational, at that point, they'll start to generally pay the senior with cash flow, but will typically accrue. So we'll probably follow up off-line and get you a little bit more specifics on which ones have some degree of cash flow, but for now, I assume majority are accruing as you think about it. In terms of the years to maturity, do you want to delineate between our maturity and senior loan maturity.Sometimes those are not coterminous. And so what we disclosed there in the supplemental on 10-B that is our maturity for our pref position and/or mezz position. And so typically, they're going to have extension rights built into those. So that's really all you're seeing there is exercise some of their extension rights that they have. That said, in terms of senior maturities, we talked a little bit about the asset in Philadelphia coming up with a maturity here in 2Q. Beyond that, our next maturity starting '25 and '26. So we really don't have much in terms of senior maturities upcoming, which typically trigger some type of capital event."", 'John P. Kim', 'Got it. And on SoCal, given the current set of emergency, are your renewal rates impacted in any way? And can you maybe just touch on your flood risk insurance policy?', 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Yes. So right now, they are in a state of emergency. So there are price gouging efforts in place. So there's a maximum of around 10% that we can charge at any given time. Right now, just in terms of how it's impacted us, we've -- happy to say it hasn't been a huge impact. We do have probably 10 or 12 units that are currently facing some leaks, but overall, it hasn't been a big impact for us."", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""And just from the insurance perspective, every single year when we go through our renewal, we obviously renew -- take a look at adequacy of limits across quick, name storm, water, whatever it may be. And so I feel we're appropriately covered at this point in time with the insurance program."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies.', 'Linda Tsai', ""Just one question. Back to innovation and other income. You highlighted the $5 million to $10 million contribution in '24. I think back at NAREIT and L.A., there was a slide showing $40 million from innovation over the next 24 to 36 months. So $13 million a year conservatively. The $5 million to $10 million you're guiding to this year is less. Did anything change in your outlook versus back at NAREIT?"", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""No, nothing's changed in our outlook. I think for us, we're just looking at the initiatives that are out in front of us. We still have a list of about 60 others that we're assessing today. And so we're constantly trying to figure out which ones to move the dial on and where we should put our efforts. And again, we think that, that's a pretty good place to start the year, and it's consistent with probably the last 5 or 6 years of around 50 basis points of incremental NOI that we've been able to produce."", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""Yes. And I think as it relates to that $40 million, a big component of that, call it, $15 million to $20 million was related to WiFi and still is. But as Mike talked about, that's kind of $5 million to $6 million incremental. So a lot of that lift comes in the coming years as we continue those rollouts and then you mature through the leasing cycle at each asset once we get that installed. I would say, too, just a little bit of context to that 45 or so basis points that we talk about innovation. That number is explicit to what I would say is very concrete ideas where things like WiFi or parking or storage where you can charge an explicit fee. We know what the rollout schedule is. That's really componentized within that 45 bps.When you look at some of our biggest opportunities that Mike mentioned, when it goes to customer experience, when it goes to fraud efforts. Those were not captured within that $40 million that we talked about, but those are also outside of other income. Those are pretty big implications as it relates to occupancy, pricing power, expenses, capital, et cetera. And so those are opportunities above and beyond that, but are very soft in nature because they're harder to quantify in terms of explicit timing by resident. And so those will come over time but aren't embedded in our guidance."", 'Linda Tsai', ""But is an opportunity in '24?"", 'Joseph D. Fisher', ""We do think there's an opportunity in '24. Mike mentioned we captured the kind of 1% of reduced turnover from customer experience. That adds a little bit to our 24 number, plus or minus $3 million on a year-over-year basis. But we do think there's a lot more opportunity above and beyond that to continue to push that customer experience and move detractors into supporters and start to continue to renew with us. Similarly, on the fraud side, we assumed no improvement year-over-year on bad debt. But in totality at that 1.5% number, that's $25 million of revenue right there, and the real cost is usually about 2x that when you factor in upstream, downstream costs, expenses return, capital return. So that's a $50 million opportunity of which we're going to be going after a portion of, obviously, as we move to the future years and roll out some of this fraud prevention."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.', 'Anthony Franklin Powell', ""Just one for me. I think you mentioned earlier in the call that you saw some softness in New York. Maybe talk about what's going on there in your kind of meeting term outlook for that market."", 'Michael D. Lacy', ""Sure, Anthony, this is Mike. Just to give a little background, New York, 8% NOI market for us, mainly down in the financial district. And I'll tell you, prior to the team this year. We're going to end up with the top revenue amongst our peers in that market. So they've done a really good job. But I'll tell you from what we've experienced, we were coming off some pretty big highs. (inaudible) We are obviously running 97.5%, 98% of [occupancy]. And then we started going to the more seasonal slow period of time. I'm happy to see that in January, our blends did actually increase from December. They're up about 150 basis points, and they're roughly flat today. So some of it's probably seasonal, some of it's coming off of a high, but we're anxiously are hopeful that things are going to continue to improve there."", 'Operator', ""There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to Chairman and CEO, Mr. Toomey for closing comments."", 'Thomas W. Toomey', 'Thanks to all of you for your time, interest and support of UDR.

And with that, I'd turn the call over to Tom."", ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""Thank you, Samantha. By now, it's old news, but on Monday, we announced my pending retirement after 31 years at Macerich. Today is my 118th Macerich earnings call and my last. I will miss all of you, I would like to say I'll miss all of you, but I'm not so sure about that. When I joined Macerich 31 years ago, it was to help Mace Siegel and Art and Ed Coppola take the company public. We did that in March of '94. Our total market cap was a modest $650 million. Today, our market cap is $11 billion. We went from having a portfolio of malls in the mid-markets, doing about $350 a foot in sales, to a portfolio in major coastal markets doing $836 per foot in tenant sales. There's been a dramatic improvement in the quality of the portfolio to say the least. When I joined Macerich in 1993. No way in hell did I think could be here 31 years later. Nothing in my Iron Man background prepared me for a run of that duration. I will be forever thankful to my Macerich colleagues and friends for our collective accomplishments. Today, Macerich is extremely well positioned for the future as I pass the baton of leadership over to a man most of you know, Jackson Hsieh. He's the right person to take the company forward and to continue to execute on our strategy of densifying and diversifying our portfolio of top quality town centers. Regarding the upcoming leadership change, there is a detailed press release and 8-K on the topic, so I will refer you there. So the remainder of this call, we will be focused on the quarterly results and the guidance and outlook for 2024. So now to focus on the quarter, I'm very happy to be leaving on extremely positive news. We had a strong fourth quarter, which included same-center NOI of 3% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. Occupancy is now up to 93.5%. That's a 90 basis point improvement over the end of 2022. We had a total shareholder return of 46% for 2023. That's a top 10 finish among all REITs. We posted positive re-leasing spreads of 17.2% for the year. We had quarterly EBITDA margin improvement of over 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year. Our partnerships sold a One Westside office building to UCLA for a pro rata share of $175 million to Macerich. We did over $890 million of financing that was closed or committed in the fourth quarter. More on that from Scott in a minute. We signed over 4 million square feet of leases during 2023. That's an all-time Macerich record, and that's on the heels of the prior record, which was set in 2022. Portfolio average sales per foot was $836, down slightly from last year, but nonetheless a top quality sales productivity. Bankruptcies continued to be at a record low. We continue to expect gains in occupancy and net operating income as we progress through 2024 and into 2025. Also, keep in mind, as a result of the very strong leasing activity in '22 and '23, we have a very large and healthy leasing pipeline with nearly 2.2 million square feet of leases that have been signed but are not open yet. Once those 10 tenants open, it is going to fuel our NOI growth in '24 and '25. And now I'd like to turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail the financial results, earnings guidance and the significant financing activity we had in the past few months."", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Thank you, Tom. This morning, we're extremely pleased to report a strong finish to the year. As Tom noted, same-center NOI increased 3% during the fourth quarter of 2023 relative to the fourth quarter of '22 when excluding lease termination income for the year, 2024 same-center NOI growth excluding lease termination income was a positive 4.5%. FFO per share for the fourth quarter was $0.56 and was $1.80 per share for 2023 for the year. The quarterly result was $0.03 or 5.7% more than FFO during the fourth quarter of 2022 at $0.53 a share and was in line with consensus estimates for the quarter. FFO for the year was in line with our most recently issued guidance, which was a midpoint of $1.80 per share. Primary major factors contributing to the quarterly FFO per share increase are as follows: one, an $11 million increase in rental revenues, which included a $13 million increase in top line minimum rent, $2 million increase in recovery revenue, which were offset by a $4 million decline in percentage rent. These trends are consistent with what's been reported over prior quarters, they're driven by improved occupancy growth and rental rate as well as a continued conversion from variable to fixed rent structures with CAM and tax recovery charges. Secondly, we had a $9 million increase in termination income. This was primarily driven by a single lease termination deal, which was a very strategic transaction that we expect will facilitate a major future redevelopment opportunity. These positive factors were offset by the following: one, an $11 million unfavorable increase in interest expense due to rising rates. This figure excludes accrued default interest, which is consistent with our reporting over the prior quarter. And then secondly, a $4 million decline in noncash straight-line rental revenue, primarily from the conversion of GAAP to cash rents for the lease with Google at One Westside, which Tom mentioned we've disposed of as of year-end. To recap, as we have emerged from the 2020 pandemic same-center NOI growth, generated by our high-quality Class-A portfolio has been tremendous, with NOI growth averaging 7.4% in both '21 and '22, followed by 4.5% same-center NOI growth in 2023. We are extremely pleased with our resilient core NOI growth during the past 3 years. This morning, we issued our initial guidance for 2024 funds from operations. 2024 FFO is estimated in the range of $1.76 to $1.86 per share or $1.81 per share at the midpoint. Here are several details underlying this earnings guidance. The FFO range includes an estimated same-center NOI growth in the range of 2.25% to 3.25%. In terms of quarterly cadence for our 2024 estimated FFO guidance, we expect approximately 21% in the first quarter, approximately 24% in both the second and third quarters and the remaining approximately 31% within the fourth quarter of 2024. Primary major factors that result in a reconciliation between 2023 actual funds from operations and 2024 estimated FFO are as follows: Same-center NOI is estimated to contribute roughly $0.10 of FFO this year. We had roughly $0.03 of FFO estimated from a relative improvement in valuation adjustments pertaining to our investment in direct investment in retailers. And we had roughly a $0.015 year-over-year increase from the acquisition of our partner's interest in Freehold Raceway Mall transaction, which closed in the latter part of 2023. These positive factors will be substantively offset by the following: one, a $0.07 increase in interest expense when viewed on a same-center basis, two, an anticipated $0.04 decline in land sale gains. And we've spoken about this in the past, this decline is due to the robust disposition activity from our land sale program that we've undertaken since 2021 which is significantly depleted our undeveloped land inventory that remains. And then lastly, about a $0.015 per share dilutive impact from increased share count which is primarily driven from the company's various share-based compensation plans. To emphasize, consistent with 2023, our 2024 outlook continues to reflect healthy operating cash flow generation of approximately $300 million after recurring capital expenditures and leasing costs, but before payment of dividends. More details regarding our guidance assumptions can be found onPage 15 of the company's Form 8-K supplemental that was filed early this morning. On to the balance sheet. Over the past few months, we have made considerable progress addressing our debt maturities. In December, we closed a $710 million 5-year CMBS refinance of the $666 million loan on Tysons Corner Center. The new loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.6% and is interest only for the entire loan term. Also in December, our joint venture sold One Westside, as Tom alluded to, to UCLA for $700 million. The existing $325 million loan on the property was repaid and approximately $78 million of net proceeds were generated at our 25% ownership share. In January, we closed a $24 million, 5-year bank loan refinance of the existing $23 million loan on Chandler Boulevard shops. The new loan bears variable interest at SOFR plus 2.5%. And is interest only for the entire duration of the loan term. In January also, we repaid the majority of the loan on Fashion District in Philadelphia, roughly $8 million remains, and that matures in April and is anticipated to be repaid at that time. In January, we closed $155 million 10-year CMBS refinance of the existing $117 million loan on Danbury Fair. The new loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.39% and is interest only during the majority of the 10-year loan term. We are currently working with the loan servicer on a multiyear extension of the $86 million loan on Fashion Outlets of Niagara and we do expect this transaction to close later this month. Once closed on that Niagara extension, we will have a very manageable $400 million of maturities remaining in 2024 and across 3 separate loans. To recap the year, we've been extremely active in the debt capital markets during 2023 and year-to-date so far in 2024 across 8 transactions, including Niagara, we will have refinanced or extended 8 loans totaling $2.9 billion or $2.1 billion at our ownership share. This activity included a 4.5-year renewal and upsizing of our $650 million revolving corporate credit facility during the third quarter of last year and let's remind ourselves that closing was amidst the regional banking crisis within the United States. So we're very pleased with our activity throughout last year and to start this year. A year ago, we anticipated improvement in the debt capital markets during the latter portion of 2023 given that the Federal Reserve was expected to be then near the end of its historic rate hiking cycle. And in fact, that expectation has proven true. We're now finding significant opportunities to finance our assets within the sustained strong performance of our Class A retail. We also believe that we are benefiting from a rotation of financing capital away from the office sector and into the Class A retail real estate sector. Our recent transactional activity supports that thesis. In mid-November, we acquired our partner's half share in Freehold Raceway Mall for $5.6 million and the assumption of our partner share of debt. We now own 100% of Freehold Raceway Mall. We currently have approximately $657 million of available liquidity, which includes $490 million of capacity on our corporate credit facility. And with that, I'll turn it over to Doug to discuss the leasing and operating environment."", 'Douglas J. Healey', ""Thanks, Scott. We closed out 2023 with very strong leasing metrics and leasing volumes. In fact, 2023 was a historic and record leasing year for Macerich, dating back 30 years as a public company. Year-end 2023 sales were down 1.8% from year-end 2022 and after a post-pandemic spike in spending across all retail categories, 2023 was clouded with increasing interest rates, inflation and the constant threat of a recession. In addition, we've definitely seen a change in spending habits. Consumers now focusing on travel, dining out, entertainment and other various services. This doesn't come as a surprise, and we expect 2024 to once again normalize and ultimately reflect more traditional consumer spending habits. Sales per square foot as of December 31, 2023 were $836. That's down slightly from $847 at the end of the third quarter, and that's primarily due to a decline in the sales of electric vehicles. Trailing 12 month leasing spreads were a very healthy 17%. As of December 31, 2023, that's up 660 basis points from the third quarter and up over 13% when compared to December 31, 2022. In the fourth quarter, we opened 391,000 square feet of new stores. For the full year 2023, we opened almost 1.6 million square feet of new stores, which is 80% more square footage than we opened during the same period in 2022. Notable openings in the fourth quarter include an expanded and newly reimagined American Eagle flagship at Tysons Corner Center; Five Below at Valley Mall, Levi's at Los Cerritos, Pandora at Stonewood and North Face at Broadway Plaza and FlatIron Crossing. In the digitally native and emerging brands category, we opened Beyond Yoga at Broadway Plaza, Purple at Los Cerritos, Warby Parker at Chandler and YETI at Washington Square. In the international category, we opened Aritzia, and Intimissimi at Corte Madera, Lululemon at Freehold Raceway Mall; UNIQLO at Green Acres, Zimmerman at Scottsdale Fashion Square and Zara at Queens Center. Lastly, in the Experiential category, we opened Camp at Tysons Corner and Round1 Spo-Cha at Arrowhead Town Center. Now let's take a look at the new and renewal leases we signed in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we signed 186 leases for 1.1 million square feet. For the full year 2023 we signed leases for 4.2 million square feet, and that's up from 3.8 million square feet or 12% when compared to the same period in 2022. And as I mentioned earlier, 2023 was a record leasing year for Macerich over the past 3 decades. Notable new lease signings in the fourth quarter include Buck Mason, Kate Spade, MANGO, Maggiano's and Level 99 at Tysons Corner, Round1 at Chandler, Dave & Buster's at Freehold, Launch and Shoprite at Green Acres, a second office lease with San Bernardino County at Inland Center or Arc'teryx at Washington Square, True Food Kitchen at 29th Street and Vuori at Scottsdale Fashion Square. As always, our focus in the fourth quarter was in large part addressing our lease expirations, finalizing 2023 and getting a head start in 2024. In doing so, in the fourth quarter, we signed over 130 renewal leases with 84 brands totaling 475,000 square feet. With that, we're basically done with 2023 and now have commitments on 44% of our 2024 expiring square footage with another 34% in the letter of intent stage. 2023 was another year of newness for us, once again bringing new unique and emerging brands was a major initiative for our leasing team and a way for us to really reimagine and differentiate our town centers from our competition. To that end in 2023, we signed leases with over 80 new Macerich brands, totaling just over 600,000 square feet. Examples include Beyond Yoga, YETI, Club Studio, Shoprite, Level 99 and Maggiano's, Elephante and Catch, just to name a few. Turning to our leasing pipeline. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 126 signed leases for 2.2 million square feet of new stores, which we expect to open in 2024, 2025 and 2026. In addition to these signed leases, we're currently negotiating another 80 leases for new stores totaling almost 600,000 square feet, which will also open in 2024, 2025 and 2026. So in total, that's over 2.8 million square feet of new store openings throughout the remainder of this year and into 2026. And I want to emphasize, these are new leases with retailers not yet open and not yet paying rent, and these numbers do not include renewals. And I can tell you that this leasing pipeline of new store opening accounts for $64 million of incremental rent, which represents roughly 8% of our current net operating income and this incremental rent will continue to grow as we approve new deals and sign new leases. So to conclude, our leasing and operating metrics were very solid in 2023. There was only 1 bankruptcy in our portfolio in the fourth quarter and only 10 for all of 2023. And bankruptcies overall in both 2022 and 2023 were at their lowest levels since 2013, which is consistent with our significantly reduced tenant watch list. Leasing volumes were at record levels. the result of which is a very strong, vibrant and exciting pipeline of tenants slated to open this year and into 2026. And as I've said in the past, and it remains the case, while there's still uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, to date, we continue to see a little pullback from the retailers. And I think this is a result of the very healthy retailer environment that exists today as well as a testament to our best-in-class portfolio of super regional town centers. So given this and everything Tom and Scott discussed, we remain optimistic as we look to 2024 and beyond. And now I'll turn the call over to the operator to open it up for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America Securities.', 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', ""And first, congratulations to Tom and Ed, I wish you the best in retirement. I guess probably appropriate first question would be for Jackson on, the fact that Tom said. You're the right person to take things forward, you talked about densification efforts, tremendous leasing is Jackson, what are you -- I know you just started, but could you provide some of your initial thoughts? Like should we expect any strategy changes at this -- do you have in mind?"", ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""Jeff, it's Tom. Jackson is actually not with us here. He's enjoying some much deserved time off. He starts March 1, so I'll just ask you to hang on to that question until then, Jeff."", 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', ""Okay. Sorry about that, if I miss that. If I could then ask Doug, and congratulations, Doug, on a great '23 in terms of leasing. I appreciate all the stats you provided, including where you stand today on '24. I think you said 80% commitments, square footage, 44% in LOI stage, I guess would you be able to compare that to where you stood a year ago as you entered '23, which turned out to be a record year? Like how do you feel today versus 1 year ago?"", 'Douglas J. Healey', ""Well, there's 2 parts to that question, Jeff. I think the first part, you were referring to our lease expirations. We're basically done with all of our expiring square footage in 2023, and we have commitments on 44% of our 2024 expiring square footage and another 34% in the letter of intent stage. So we're about 77% there with 2024 expiring square footage. I think the other part of the question really referenced more of our leasing pipeline in which we said we had 126 leases signed for 2.2 million square feet. That's just about, Jeff, where we were at this time last year, give or take, just a little bit."", 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', ""And then if I can then ask a second question. What are you assuming in terms of bad debt lease termination income in '24? And how does that compare, let's say, to '23 or maybe versus historical?"", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Jeff, I'll take that. This is Scott. Bad debts, we're assuming those to start to normalize a little bit more relative to 2023. I would say that's about a $0.02 headwind in 2024 against our same center. I don't expect those to be significant in the fullness of time, but I do expect them to be a little bit larger than they were in '23, which frankly was a net reversal, and that was just a continuation of recovering some of those latent fully reserved receivables in '23. I expect most of that to be out of the pipeline now, and it will be trending a little bit more normal. Lastly, termination income, we did provide line item guidance for that, which is $10 million, and that was down about $3 million or so, give or take, versus where we finished in 2023."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.', 'Viktor Fediv', 'This is Viktor Fediv here on with Greg McGinniss. I wanted to follow up on this lease termination income in Q4. I know probably that you cannot provide some specific details. But overall, what type of tenant was that? And you mentioned that it opened some strategic opportunity for you to redevelop that center. So when it will be [acquired], can you provide some more details on that?', 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Yes. The -- yes, you're right, I can't speak to the specific tenant or the asset, frankly, other than to say, like I mentioned at the outset, that the lion's share of that termination fee, pretty much all but roughly $1 million, $1.5 million of that was from that single transaction. That transaction was an anchor location in terms of the type of space, but we do expect that to open up a really significant redevelopment opportunity. We are working on predevelopment and preplanning of that right now as well as entitlement. Once we narrow down the scope and the exact cost and returns, which we expect to be, the returns to be in the low double-digit realm, we will disclose that in our pipeline. But it is a good opportunity. We're very glad to get that transaction completed."", 'Viktor Fediv', 'And then the second question, probably on leasing demand part. So given that department stores sales were weaker versus broad retail sales in 2023, do you expect more optimization to occur within that space? And have you had any conversations with your tenants about that already?', 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""So I'm not quite sure I caught all of that question. I would say this, though, and this is probably a good thing. As we look into 2024, I would not expect us to put up the same type of volume that we did in 2023 because in all candor, we're running out of large-format inventory, we're running out of boxes, big anchor locations. Over the last few years since 2021, we've leased about 2 million square feet and over 20 anchor locations. So it's been very productive."", ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""Yes, I think you're going to continue to see the shift away from department stores and into other big box uses. You saw us open SCHEELS sporting goods, for example, in a former department store space. You'll see us open ARTE MUSEUM in the former art-like theater space. We're going to continue to see different types of uses, diversified uses, taking the department store space and converting that into other uses that frankly drive more sales and traffic. That's a trend we've seen accelerating over the last 5 years, and that is going to continue as we go forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore.', 'Samir Upadhyay Khanal', ""Tom, congratulations on your retirement. We will miss you. So Scott, just on same-store NOI guidance here. Certainly, leasing is very strong. The pipeline looks great in the '24. But I just want to kind of dive into the same-store NOI growth that is moderating in '24. Maybe help us think through the drivers of that lower growth in '24 at this time."", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Sure, Samir. I'll walk through it. Obviously, great growth over the last 3 years, as I highlighted in my opening remarks. So for starters, we are dealing with some more challenging comps. In addition, I would say operating expenses do remain relatively elevated when you think of things like insurance costs, security and labor, I mentioned bad debts, those are all contributing to some headwind in same center that I would quantify it roughly 150 basis points or so, headwind in same center. We are -- given the robust leasing environment and remerchandising our space, we are taking space offline, so there is an element of downtime within that same center guidance. And I would estimate that kind of bracket a roughly 1% headwind in the same center. That's all positive, though, because we're taking underperforming merchants offline. We're putting in much more attractive merchants, much more diversified uses that will draw traffic and better sales volumes at better rent levels. So that is what you typically see in a robust leasing environment. So those are really some of the major moving pieces. And then, of course, as we do with each and every year, we do embed some reserves for the unanticipated in our guide."", 'Samir Upadhyay Khanal', 'Got it. And just from a modeling perspective, help us think through G&A for the year and also percentage rents?', 'Scott W. Kingsmore', 'Sure. G&A, I think if I were to point you to a run rate, we look at 2023, and I would expect maybe a marginal decline versus 2023 and 2024 across management company expenses, net revenues, rate expenses.', ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""One other thing to keep in mind on the G&A line, Samir, if you take a look at our proxy -- last proxy, Page 50, you'll see the combined compensation for Ed Coppola and Tom O'Hern and from the 8-K, you'll be able to ascertain the compensation for Jackson. So that will be a fairly significant reduction in G&A just as a result of the CEO and President change."", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""And then, Samir, you also asked about percentage rents. If my memory is right, about 12 months ago, I said we do expect roughly a 15% to 20% decline in percentage rents into 2023 from 2022. And in fact, that played out. If you look at our percentage rents on a pro rata basis, they were down about 16% in '23 versus '22. And again, largely, that was a function of conversion of variable rent to fixed rent type structures. I think we worked through the vast majority of those at this point, Doug. I don't expect a lot more of that. As we look into 2024, and we're looking at percentage rent trends versus '23, I expect those to continue to tick down, but not nearly as significantly as they did in 2023. We're estimating roughly about a mid-single digit decline in percentage rents and some of that is just as you get escalations and base rents, you get an increase in breakpoint. So there's a natural transition of variable rent to fixed rent on that basis. But I don't expect the type of leasing activity converting variable to fixed rent that we had in 2023 at all."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.', 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', 'Great. Can you hear me?', ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", 'We can hear you Floris. Loud and clear.', 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', 'Great. Tom, congrats on the retirement. Good luck in your next venture, whatever you wind up doing.', ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", 'Thank you, Floris. I remember you when you were 25 and fresh out of UVA, and we were going to visit malls in Northern California.', 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', ""I remember that, that was -- and by the way, that was one of my low lowlight is actually, as some of you might have heard -- I don't know I won't share that on this call, but -- but yes, I do remember that. That was a memorable time. I had, I guess, 2 questions for you. Number one, if you can -- one of the issues, I guess, with the mall sector, and you're not unique. I think some of your peers have had to grapple with this as well. But is the -- people don't think there's going to be much growth in the sector. Can you maybe touch on -- obviously, the underlying growth was very strong last year, you're expecting a little bit of a slowdown this year, probably with some conservatism baked in, I would imagine. But maybe talk a little bit about some of the key drivers for growth. Obviously, you touched upon the SNO pipeline. Maybe can you give a little bit more color on what percentage of that SNO pipeline, for example, is luxury tenants? I know there's a big win coming online at Scottsdale. How much of a driver of growth is that potentially for you going forward?"", ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""Well, I'll let Doug talk about luxury in a second, Floris. But as for people saying they don't see the growth in the mall sector, then they're clearly ignoring the facts. All you have to do is look at record leasing volumes in '22 and '23 and then drill down a little deeper and look at the types of tenants that are coming in, replacing traditional retail. This isn't apparel retail. This isn't footwear. These are new uses, new and creative food and beverage like Pinstripes, Lifetime Fitness, for example, very actively coming in, and they can generate an additional 5,000 trips to the center. We -- just that one tenant alone, adding ARTE Museum, they expect to have 1 million visitors per year coming to the top level of Santa Monica place. So there are a lot of exciting new uses that, frankly, we didn't have 10 years ago. So I think whoever said they didn't see the growth driving to the mall business, the A-quality mall business was sadly mistaken because all these new uses are driving traffic, they're driving sales, they're driving productivity. They're driving rent and they're going to drive NOI."", 'Douglas J. Healey', ""Floris, it's Doug. With regard to your specific questions about luxury, as you know, a few years back, we finished the luxury wing at Scottsdale Fashion Square and the Neiman Marcus wing. And late last year, early this year, we're now focusing on bringing luxury -- global luxury to the Nordstrom Wing. I think a few calls ago, we announced Hermes, which is the bellwether tenant for that property, and we'll be announcing more over the next several months. But to Tom's point, I talked about the leasing pipeline all the time. And it's 2.2 million square feet. It's going to open over the next 2.5 years. Those are phenomenal numbers. But the thing that really excites me is the uses we're going to be bringing. So that just all new uses, new exciting uses. You think about (inaudible) and you think about Elephante, TrueFood Kitchen, Vuori, H&M, Primark, Dave and Buster's, Kierland, Lifetime Fitness, Tom mentioned Pinstripes, Target, Level 99. I mean that's really the beauty of this pipeline not just the metrics but the depth and breadth of uses that we're bringing to our town centers over the next 2, 2.5 years."", 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', ""Great. Maybe a follow-up with Scott. I know you mentioned that Niagara is going to get refinanced, and that might surprise some people myself included, who thought that might transition back. I know you probably can't say a whole lot, but does this mean that you will be investing leasing capital in this asset on a going forward basis? And what do you think that can do to the operations for this property going forward as well?"", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Sure. Floris, you're right. I can't speak in too much detail because the transaction is still in process. We do expect to secure a multiyear extension of that. The asset still does generate some FFO. It certainly has its challenges given its market positioning with north of the border in Canada and the local market. There still is some opportunities for that asset, and we'll continue to -- continue to capitalize on those opportunities. But the bottom line is it's a negotiation that's still in process. It's earnings accretive to retain that asset, and we'll report back once we close."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Todd Michael Thomas', ""First, Tom, Ed, congrats on your run, best of luck in retirement. Let me -- first, I just wanted to take a stab at asking a prior question. I realize Jackson has not started yet. But Tom, maybe, Scott, I'm just curious if you can talk a little bit about where you think there might be opportunity for Jackson to have an impact as you think about the organization today and look ahead?"", ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""I'm not going to speak for Jackson. He'll be starting soon, and you can ask him directly, but I know he does like our strategy of densifying and diversifying our high-quality town centers and he found that very interesting and appealing. Other things he may be considering I will leave to him and let him articulate directly to you and others on this call."", 'Todd Michael Thomas', ""Okay. And Tom, you're staying on for a few months as an adviser, what kind of time line would you expect for Jackson to get sort of fully situated with the platform, touring assets, markets, meeting with key retailers? What's the process like for him really stepping into the CEO role?"", ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""Well, many of you on call know him. I mean, he's going to hit the ground running. I can guarantee you that. So I think there'll be a lot of travel visiting our offices, visiting our people getting going. Ed and I are still on the board through our current term, which runs through May. So people have access to both of us and I imagine he's going to be a very quick steady and hit the ground running. So I think that will all happen very, very quickly. And he's already fairly familiar with the company, did his due diligence and I can almost give to you, he will get it faster."", 'Todd Michael Thomas', ""Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just get one in for Doug. I appreciate the detail around the SNO line and the lease signings and LOIs that you've executed around the '24 expirations. Can you talk about your expectation for tenant retention during the year and maybe discuss any known move-outs or post-holiday season -- seasonality that you're expecting this year relative to the last few years where there's been a lot less seasonality than traditionally is?"", 'Douglas J. Healey', ""Todd, it's Doug. Thank you. I think -- and Scott jump in here. But I think in 2024, our expectation is between 90% and 95% tenant retention. Meaning our expirations -- our 2024 expirations between 90% and 95%, we believe, will retain."", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""And your -- I think the second part of your question was regarding any unanticipated or just fall out following the holiday. And I won't say there -- I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary. If we looked at, say, the 2016 through 2019 period, we had some precursor certainly in the fall of tenants that were likely to close, and they were closing in fairly significant routes. We have not had that for the last few years at all. And I can't think of any retailer that said, look, we're going to shut down 5 or 6 stores following the holiday season. Doug?"", 'Douglas J. Healey', ""Yes. Todd, we've talked about this a lot. I mean many of the retailers that were suffering pre-pandemic just didn't make it through pandemic. And those that came through, came through in a very healthy way. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's a very, very healthy retailer environment out there with very strong balance sheets. I think the retailers -- I know the retailers in 2023 and into 2024 already are speaking about managing the inventory levels, which is hugely important for the profitability and for the margins which actually makes them stronger. So we're not seeing really any pullback and our watch list is as low as it's ever been in 20 years. So I don't anticipate anything, anything unusual in 2024, if you will."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.', 'Michael William Mueller', ""Tom, congratulations. It's been great working with you over the years."", ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", 'Thank you. Likewise.', 'Michael William Mueller', ""And I just have one quick one for Scott. Just curious, what's embedded in the 2024 guidance for NOI margin improvement relative to what you had in 2023?"", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Yes, Mike, I think we'll see continued margin improvement. We've got improvement in rental rate. We've got growth in occupancy. Obviously, the pipeline will start to add more and more as we get towards the latter half of the year. It's still a pretty thick pipeline. In fact, I think the pipeline yields roughly $64 million, $65 million of incremental rent over existing uses. So that will be heavy in the second half. Conversely, like I said, we've got operating expenses continue to be somewhat of a drag, not a huge drag, but somewhat of a drag. So -- but I do think by the time we get to the end of the year, you'll see continued margin improvement year-over-year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.', 'Ki Bin Kim', ""Congrats, Tom. And going back to some of the debt execution that you've done in 2023 and what you have in 2024. Are there some trade-offs that don't show up in the interest rates to solve things like CapEx reserve requirements or other clauses that might be a little bit more restrictive?"", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Yes. I'd say we're always leaning into our underwriting to make sure that we're getting full credit for the pipeline. And given the depth of the pipeline, any one of these deals we're approaching, whether it's Tysons or Danbury. To the extent we have a tenant that's not yet come online, we do have to set aside that capital. It's effectively -- I guess, when you think about it, it's prefunding that capital and then we drop back down over the next 6 to 12 months. And so for instance, for Tysons, I think there was an incremental $40 million, give or take, of liquidity. But a lot of that liquidity was soaked up in CapEx reserves for a lot of restaurant uses. We've recently discussed Level 99, which is a new entertainment use on the east side of the center. So we did have to set aside the anticipated leasing capital to bring that use to opening and paying rent. But other than that, no, I'd say that the environment is pretty normalized. And we're getting deals done again, liquidity is back open. I'm happy to say that we probably accounted for roughly 25% of the volume that occurred in CMBS, which was about a little over $7 billion of transactions in 2023. So the markets are open and functional and as you can see from the rates somewhere in the mid-6s is where we've been transacting."", 'Ki Bin Kim', 'And what is like a broad refinance rate that we should assume for 2024 refinancing?', 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""I'd say we've been transacting in the mid-6s, and that's probably representative of where we'll be this year. We'll have to see what the Fed has in store for us for the next 12 months. But based on where we see the forward curve, that's probably a reasonable expectation."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.', 'Ravi Vijay Vaidya', ""This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. Just had 1 or 2 questions here. Regarding leverage, can you please provide a full year -- end of year '24 target? And would you consider issuing equity at current prices? I believe at the Investor Day, you referenced that you were in -- you weren't looking to issue equity until the previous target, which is around $18 a share, and we're getting close to that at this point. So I just wanted to follow up on that."", ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""Ravi, I'll take the second half of that question. We always reserve the right to issue equity. So I'm not going to give you a hard and fast rule in terms of a dollar amount. You've seen us in the past, judiciously use our ATM, and we have an ATM in place today, and that's another tool in the capital toolkit that we would keep available to us. So it's certainly possible. And look, we're very focused on delevering over time. That can happen in a few ways, one of which is to drive same-center NOI up, which we fully plan to do. And the other way to effectively reduce debt-to-EBITDA is via equity raises. So we wouldn't preclude ourselves from doing that. We do not have any of that in the guidance, but that's consistent with past practice as well. Scott, do you want to comment on leverage?"", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Yes. Sure, Ravi. To your first part of your question, I think we could see 40 to 50 basis points of improvement in leverage by the time we get to the end of the year. Roughly 8.2x is kind of where we're triangulating based on the business plan today."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.', 'Caitlin Burrows', ""Congrats, Tom, on your retirement. Maybe starting with Santa Monica Place in Scottsdale Fashion Square. I feel like the expected openings are getting closer on those. And I think combined, they're supposed to have an incremental NOI of around $50 million at your share. So I'm just wondering if you can give some further detail on the timing of recognizing that NOI? Like could it start in the first half of this year? Or any other details you can give?"", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Yes. Caitlin, both of those projects are going to start to open in late '24, early '25. So I would say you'll see a full -- for the most part, you'll see a full impact in 2025, maybe a little bit of bleed into '26. But looking at those individually, Scottsdale, will start to open up a lot of those uses in fall, the renovation for that project. I think most of the scaffolding will be down and the physical work will be done by the time we get to the end of the quarter. But the -- in terms of new tenants coming online, it will start to come online in the fourth quarter, and we'll see kind of the full year effect in '25. Santa Monica, we've got some exciting uses coming first Level, Club Studio, which is high-end fitness. Third level, ARTE. Both of those are going to be done in the first half of 2025. So you'll see some bleed into 2026 there. Din Tai Fung will also be a use that we hope to get online either at the end of this year, beginning of next year. So all those are very accretive leases that we expect to be on board, certainly by second quarter of 2025."", 'Caitlin Burrows', ""Got it. And maybe you guys talked earlier in the call about how percent rents were down in '23 because more was being shifted to base rents, which makes sense. I was wondering if you could go through any details on how much that kind of phenomenon impacted leasing spreads like that the expiring ABR might have been somewhat lower and related kind of the level of leasing spreads that you reported in 4Q of almost 20%. Do you think that's sustainable?"", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Sure. Great question. Yes. Certainly, if you look at our expiring rents in 2023, they were a lot lower than what we expected in 2024. And that was really driven again by all those shorter-term deals that we did during COVID, which had more variable rent and we're accessing those throughout 2023 and renewing those on a longer term more typical fixed rent structure. So as we reported trailing 12%, 17% spreads at the end of the year, and I would expect those base rent spreads to be roughly 50% of that level in 2024. Really, again, just a function of a relatively artificially low base rent expiring in '23 and a more normalized level of base rent expiring in 2024."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.', 'Nicholas Gregory Joseph', 'Just hoping you could walk through the capital needs and the funding plan for leasing-related CapEx and any incremental redevelopment in 2024.', 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Sure. I did mentioned in my opening remarks, Nick, -- that we do expect after recurring CapEx and leasing costs to still have generated roughly $300 million of operating cash flow before payment of dividend. As I look at '24, '25, '26 development pipeline, I think, we will range between $150 million to $200 million over those 3 years, and we're probably somewhere around that midpoint of that for 2024. We are -- we've got probably 8 to 9, 10 anchor boxes that we continue to work on that will largely be re-tenanted and completed by the end of the year but will also be set in the table for some larger-scale redevelopments, potentially Green Acres, potentially FlatIron for 2025 and 2026. So that will give you an idea of some of the character of what we're spending on."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Tom and Eddie certainly for 2 decades of working with you guys in REIT land. It's been awesome and we'll miss our -- may be the interaction. So I wish you guys the best in your next endeavor. So I have 2 questions. The first question is, Scott, on the Danbury Mall loan, you know how much I like that mall. Can you just help us walk through and interpret the $155 million new loan relative to the value of that mall? Just given the sales that it does and the dominance in that northern region, we think that the loan is underlevered relative to the value of the asset. Obviously, the market today is a tough market to do debt. So maybe just some perspective around how we should interpret the loan balance relative to where the market value of that asset would be sort of in normal times, obviously, not right now when people are skittish."", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Sure. Yes, it's a great asset. It's virtually 100% occupied. I think there's 1 or 2 available storefronts. So very happy to get a 10-year deal on it, stagger out that maturity, et cetera, et cetera, especially at a very attractive rate. The the loan-to-value, if I recall correctly, was in the low 40s based on appraisal. We typically, as you know, from following us many years, we typically finance in the 55% realm. So yes, there's a little bit of liquidity on the table, but it's the state of the market today. And I think it was a great execution hitting a window. And recall, we've been trying to finance that thing through a difficult capital market environment for almost 2 years. So it was really nice to be able to hit a window and execute well at a good rate."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', 'Okay. And then the second question is on the JV, the Freehold and Chandler JV, you bought out Freehold, but Chandler still seems to be a JV. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about what drove the JV to sort of cleave off the asset? I think you guys said $5.6 million that you used to acquire that. What was unique about that asset versus Chandler that still is in JV? Or should we expect something to happen in the near future on Chandler as well?', ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""Alex, really, we can't comment on what motivated or didn't motivate our partner in that case. It was really their decision. But when given the opportunity, we like the economics, we like the asset, we had a chance to do that on Chandler. But that was really driven by them and their preference."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Congrats Tom and Ed. Just 2 quick ones for me. Just on -- going back to the management transition, obviously, can't comment for Jackson. But just about the process. The question really is, is there any sort of specific skill set or experience that you guys are looking for? And can you just comment on why was sort of now the right time for this transition? Just trying to get a little bit more color around sort of the process that you guys are looking for."", ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""Yes, Ron, I'll refer you to the press release and the 8-K. We did an exhaustive search. We used Ferguson Partners, very well-known firm that specializes in executive recruitment and we considered a lot of candidates. Those of you that know Jackson know he's very qualified and very capable, and I think we've got an outstanding replacement. In terms of the timing, every CEO should really go out when their company is in a good spot and when they have their health. So that's why it's good timing. Macerich is in great shape and I've got my health. So this is the perfect time for me to move on to all those things that I put on the back burner for the last 30 years."", 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Understood. And then one on -- so I saw the Green Acres Mall redevelopment announcement, I think, earlier this , I guess, last week or earlier this January, but I didn't see it in the supplemental. Is there -- is that going to be a large project? Like how should we think about the economics and returns on that? Or should we just wait for that to be added?"", 'Scott W. Kingsmore', ""Yes, it's a wait. I think you'll see it hitting the pipeline. We are in predevelopment and entitlement mode right now. It's going to be a very attractive project. Frankly, that's a gem from the 2 assets that we acquired back in the 2012, 2013 time frame. Green Acres has performed extremely well. We added a power center. We've been able to retenant the mall. In total, the entire property, the entire campus generates over $1 billion of sales and we're really, really excited to bring this next phase, but we're studying it, and it will hit the pipeline over the next few quarters."", 'Operator', 'I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Tom for closing remarks.', ""Thomas E. O'Hern"", ""Thank you, Michelle. Thank all of you for joining us today. All kidding aside, I would like to say that it's been my pleasure to work with you, and I will miss all of you. As I approach retirement, I'm highly confident in the future of the company under the leadership of Jackson, our Board of Directors and the balance of our incredibly talented leadership team here at Macerich. I wish you all the best."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.""]"

So the remainder of this call, we will be focused on the quarterly results and the guidance and outlook for 2024. So now to focus on the quarter, I'm very happy to be leaving on extremely positive news. We had a strong fourth quarter, which included same-center NOI of 3% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year."", ""Occupancy is now up to 93.5%. That's a 90 basis point improvement over the end of 2022. We had a total shareholder return of 46% for 2023. That's a top-10 finish among all REITs."", 'We posted positive releasing spreads of 17.2% for the year. We had quarterly EBITDA margin improvement of over 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year. Our partnerships sold a One Westside office building to UCLA for a pro-rata share of $175 million to Macerich. We did over $890 million of financings that was closed or committed in the fourth quarter.', ""More on that from Scott in a minute. We signed over 4 million square feet of leases during 2023. That's an all-time Macerich record, and that's on the heels of the prior record, which was set in 2022. Portfolio average sales per foot was $836, down slightly from last year, but nonetheless a top-quality sale activity."", ""Bankruptcies continued to be at a record low. We continue to expect gains in occupancy and net operating income as we progress through 2024 and into '25. Also, keep in mind, as a result of the very strong leasing activity in '22 and '23, we have a very large and healthy leasing pipeline with nearly 2.2 million square feet of leases that have been signed but are not open yet. Once those 10 tenants open, it is going to fuel our NOI growth in '24 and '25."", ""And now, I'd like to turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail the financial results, earnings guidance, and the significant financing activity we had in the past few months."", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Tom. This morning, we're extremely pleased to report a strong finish to the year. As Tom noted, same-center NOI increased 3% during the fourth quarter of 2023 relative to the fourth quarter of '22. When excluding lease termination income for the year 2024 same-center NOI growth, excluding lease termination income was a positive 4.5%."", 'FFO per share for the fourth quarter was $0.56 and was $1.80 per share for 2023 for the year. The quarterly result was $0.03 or 5.7% more than FFO during the fourth quarter of 2022 at $0.53 a share and was in line with consensus estimates for the quarter. FFO for the year was in line with our most recently issued guidance, which was a midpoint of $1.80 per share. Primary major factors contributing to the quarterly FFO per share increase are as follows.', ""One, an $11 million increase in rental renews, which included a $13 million increase in top-line minimum rent, $2 million increase in recovery revenue, which were offset by a $4 million decline in percentage rent. These trends are consistent with what's been reported over prior quarters, they're driven by improved occupancy growth and rental rate as well as a continued conversion from variable to fixed rent structures with CAM and tax recovery charges. Secondly, we had a $9 million increase in termination income. This was primarily driven by a single lease termination deal, which was a very strategic transaction that we expect will facilitate a major future redevelopment opportunity."", ""These positive factors were offset by the following: one, an $11 million unfavorable increase in interest expense due to rising rates. This figure excludes accrued default interest, which is consistent with our reporting over the prior quarter. And then secondly, a $4 million decline in noncash straight-line rental revenue, primarily from the conversion of GAAP to cash rents for the lease with Google at One Westside, which Tom mentioned we've disposed of as of year-end. To recap, as we have emerged from the 2020 pandemic same-center NOI growth, generated by our high-quality Class A portfolio has been tremendous, with NOI growth averaging 7.4% in both '21 and '22, followed by 4.5% same-center NOI growth in 2023."", 'We are extremely pleased with our resilient core NOI growth during the past three years. This morning, we issued our initial guidance for 2024 funds from operations. 2024 FFO is estimated in the range of $1.76 to $1.86 per share or $1.81 per share at the midpoint. Here are several details underlying this earnings guidance.', 'The FFO range includes an estimated same-center NOI growth in the range of 2.25% to 3.25%. In terms of quarterly cadence for our 2024 estimated FFO guidance, we expect approximately 21% in the first quarter, approximately 24% in both the second and third quarters and the remaining approximately 31% within the fourth quarter of 2024. Primary major factors that result in a reconciliation between 2023 actual funds from operations and 2024 estimated FFO are as follows: Same-center NOI is estimated to contribute roughly $0.10 of FFO this year. We had roughly $0.03 of FFO estimated from a relative improvement in valuation adjustments pertaining to our investment in direct investment in retailers.', ""And we had roughly a $0.015 year-over-year increase from the acquisition of our partner's interest in Freehold Raceway Mall transaction, which closed in the latter part of 2023. These positive factors will be substantively offset by the following: one, a $0.07 increase in interest expense when viewed on a same-center basis, two, an anticipated $0.04 decline in land sale gains. We've spoken about this in the past. This decline is due to the robust disposition activity from our land sale program that we've undertaken since 2021 which is significantly depleted our undeveloped land inventory that remains."", ""And then lastly, about a $0.015 per share dilutive impact from increased share count which is primarily driven from the Company's various share-based compensation plans. To emphasize, consistent with 2023, our 2024 outlook continues to reflect healthy operating cash flow generation of approximately $300 million after recurring capital expenditures and leasing costs, but before payment of dividends. More details regarding our guidance assumptions can be found on Page 15 of the Company's Form 8-K supplemental that was filed early this morning. On to the balance sheet."", 'Over the past few months, we have made considerable progress addressing our debt maturities. In December, we closed a $710 million five-year CMBS refinance of the $666 million loan on Tysons Corner Center. The new loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.6% and is interest only for the entire loan term. Also in December, our joint venture sold One Westside, as Tom alluded to, to UCLA for $700 million.', 'The existing $325 million loan on the property was repaid and approximately $78 million of net proceeds were generated at our 25% ownership share. In January, we closed a $24 million five-year bank loan refinance of the existing $23 million loan on Chandler Boulevard Shops. The new loan bears variable interest at SOFR plus 2.5%. And is interest only for the entire duration of the long term.', 'In January also, we repaid the majority of the loan on Fashion District in Philadelphia, roughly $8 million remains, and that matures in April and is anticipated to be repaid at that time. In January, we closed $155 million 10-year CMBS refinance of the existing $117 million loan on Danbury Fair. The new loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.39% and is interest only during of the 10-year loan term. We are currently working with the loan servicer on a multiyear extension of the $86 million loan on Fashion Outlets of Niagara and we do expect this transaction to close later this month.', ""Once closed on that Niagara extension, we will have a very manageable $400 million of maturities remaining in 2024 and across three separate loans. To recap the year, we've been extremely active in the debt capital markets during 2023, and year to date so far in 2024 across eight transactions, including Niagara, we will have refinanced or extended eight loans totaling $2.9 billion or $2.1 billion at our ownership share. This activity included a four-and-a-half-year renewal and upsizing of our $650 million revolving corporate credit facility during the third quarter of last year and let's remind ourselves that closing was amid the regional banking crisis within the United States. So we're very pleased with our activity throughout last year and to start this year."", ""A year ago, we anticipated improvement in the debt capital markets during the latter portion of 2023 given that the Federal Reserve was expected to be then near the end of its historic rate hiking cycle. And in fact, that expectation has proven true. We're now finding significant opportunities to finance our assets within the sustained strong performance of our Class A retail. We also believe that we are benefiting from a rotation of financing capital away from the office sector and into the Class A retail real estate sector."", ""Our recent transactional activity supports that thesis. In mid-November, we acquired our partner's half share in Freehold Raceway Mall for $5.6 million and the assumption of our partner share of debt. We now own 100% of Freehold Raceway Mall. We currently have approximately $657 million of available liquidity, which includes $490 million of capacity on our corporate credit facility."", ""And with that, I'll turn it over to Doug to discuss the leasing and operating environment."", 'Doug Healey -- Senior Executive Vice President, Leasing', 'Thanks, Scott. We closed out 2023 with very strong leasing metrics and leasing volumes. In fact, 2023 was a historic and record leasing year for Macerich, dating back 30 years as a public company. Year-end 2023 sales were down 1.8% from year-end 2022 and after a post-pandemic spike in spending across all retail categories, 2023 was clouded with increasing interest rates, inflation, and the constant threat of a recession.', ""In addition, we've definitely seen a change in spending habits with consumers now focusing on travel, dining out, entertainment, and other various services. This doesn't come as a surprise, and we expect 2024 to once again normalize and ultimately reflect more traditional consumer spending habits. Sales per square foot as of December 31st, 2023 were $836. That's down slightly from $847 at the end of the third quarter, and that's primarily due to a decline in the sales of electric vehicles."", ""Trailing fall leasing spreads were a very healthy 17%. As of December 31st, 2023, that's up 660 basis points from the third quarter and up over 13% when compared to December 31st, 2022. In the fourth quarter, we opened 391,000 square feet of new stores. For the full year 2023, we opened almost 1.6 million square feet of new stores, which is 80% more square footage than we opened during the same period in 2022."", ""Notable openings in the fourth quarter include an expanded and newly reimagined American Eagle flagship at Tysons Corner Center; Five Below at Valley Mall, Levi's at Los Cerritos, Pandora at Stonewood and North Face at Broadway Plaza and FlatIron Crossing. In the digitally native and emerging brands category, we opened Beyond Yoga at Broadway Plaza, Purple at Los Cerritos, Warby Parker at Chandler, and YETI at Washington Square. In the international category, we opened Aritzia and Intimissimi, Corte Madera, Lululemon at Freehold Raceway Mall; UNIQLO at Green Acres, Zimmerman at Scottsdale Fashion Square, and Zara at Queens Center. Lastly, in the experiential category, we opened Camp at Tysons Corner and Round1 Spo-cha at Arrowhead Town Center."", ""Now let's take a look at the new and renewal leases we signed in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we signed 186 leases for 1.1 million square feet. For the full year 2023, we signed leases for 4.2 million square feet, and that's up from 3.8 million square feet or 12% when compared to the same period in 2022. And as I mentioned earlier, 2023 was a record leasing year for Macerich over the past three decades."", ""Notable new lease signings in the fourth quarter include Buck Mason, Kate Spade, Mango, Maggiano's, and Level 99 at Tysons Corner, Round1 at Chandler, Dave and Busters at Freehold, launch in ShopRite at Green Acres, a second office lease with San Bernardino County at Inland Center, Arterex at Washington Square, True Food Kitchen at 29th Street and BOSS at Scottsdale Fashion Square. As always, our focus in the fourth quarter was in large part addressing our lease expirations, finalizing 2023, and getting a head start in 2024. In doing so, in the third quarter, we signed over 130 renewal leases with 84 brands totaling 475,000 square feet. With that, we're basically done with 2023 and now have commitments on 44% of our 2024 expiring square footage with another 34% in the letter of intent stage."", ""2023 was another year of newness for us. Once again, bringing new unique, and emerging brands was a major initiative for our leasing team and a way for us to really reimagine and differentiate our town center from our competition. To that end in 2023, we signed leases with over 80 new Macerich brands, totaling just over 600,000 square feet. Examples include Beyond Yoga, YETI, Club Studio, Shoprite, Level 99, and Maggiano's, Elephante, and Ketch, just to name a few."", ""Turning to our leasing pipeline. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 126 signed leases for 2.2 million square feet of new stores, which we expect to open in 2024, 2025, and 2026. In addition to these signed leases, we're currently negotiating other 80 leases for new stores totaling almost 600,000 square feet, which will also open in '24, 2025, and 2026. So in total, that's over 2.8 million square feet of new store openings throughout the remainder of this year and into 2026."", 'And I want to emphasize, these are new leases with retailers not yet open and not yet paying rent, and these numbers do not include renewals. And I can tell you that this leasing pipeline of new store opening accounts for $64 million of incremental rent, which represents roughly 8% of our current net operating income and this incremental rent will continue to grow as we approve new deals and sign new leases. So to conclude, our leasing and operating metrics were very solid in 2023. There was only one bankruptcy in our portfolio in the fourth quarter and only 10% for all of 2023.', ""The bankruptcies overall in both 2022 and 2023 were at their lowest levels since 2013, which is consistent with our significantly reduced tenant watch list. Leasing volumes were at record levels. The result of which is a very strong, vibrant and exciting pipeline of tenants slated to open this year and into 2026. And as I've said in the past, and it remains the case, while there's still uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, to date, we continue to see a little pullback from the retailers."", ""And I think this is a result of the very healthy retailer environment that exists today as well as a testament to our best-in-class portfolio of super regional town centers. So given this and everything Tom and Scott discussed, we remain optimistic as we look to 2024 and beyond. And now, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open it up for Q&A."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.', 'Jeff Spector -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you. And first, congratulations to Tom and Ed, I wish you the best in retirement. I guess probably appropriate first question would be for Jackson on the fact that Tom said.', ""You're the right person to take things forward, you talked about densification efforts, tremendous leasing is Jackson, what are you -- I know you just started, but could you provide some of your initial thoughts? Like should we expect any strategy changes at this -- do you have in mind?"", ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""Hey, Jeff. It's Tom. Jackson is actually not with us here. He's enjoyed so much-deserved time off."", ""He starts March 1st, so I'll just ask you to hang on to that question until then, Jeff."", 'Jeff Spector -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""OK. Sorry about that, if I miss that. If I could then ask Doug, and congratulations, Doug, on a great '23 in terms of leasing. I appreciate all the stats you provided, including where you stand today on '24."", ""I think you said 80% commitments, square footage, 44% in LOI stage, I guess would you be able to compare that to where you stood a year ago as you entered '23, which turned out to be a record year? Like how do you feel today versus one: year ago?"", 'Doug Healey -- Senior Executive Vice President, Leasing', ""Well, there's two parts to that question, Jeff. I think the first part, you were referring to our lease expirations. We're basically done with all of our expiring square footage in 2023, and we have commitments on 44% of our 2024 expiring square footage and another 34% in the letter of intent stage. So we're about 77% there with 2024 expiring square footage."", ""I think the other part of the question really referenced more of our leasing pipeline in which we said we had 126 leases signed for 2.2 million square feet. That's just about, Jeff, where we were at this time last year, give or take, just a little bit."", 'Jeff Spector -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""And then if I can then ask a second question. What are you assuming in terms of bad debt lease termination income in '24? And how does that compare, let's say, to '23 or maybe versus historical?"", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Jeff, I'll take that. This is Scott. Bad debts, we're assuming those to start to normalize a little bit more relative to 2023. I would say that's about a $0.02 headwind in 2024 against our same center."", ""I don't expect those to be significant in the fullness of time, but I do expect them to be a little bit larger than they were in '23, which frankly was a net reversal, and that was just a continuation of recovering some of those latent fully reserved receivables in '23. I expect most of that to be out of the pipeline now, and it will be trending a little bit more normal. Lastly, termination income, we did provide line item guidance for that, which is $10 million, and that was down about $3 million or so, give or take, versus where we finished in 2023."", 'Jeff Spector -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, Scott.', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure.', 'Operator', 'One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is open.', 'Viktor Fediv -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', 'Hello. This is Viktor Fediv here on with Greg McGinniss. I wanted to follow up on this lease termination income in Q4. I know probably that you cannot provide some specific details.', 'But overall, what type of tenant was that? And you mentioned that it opened some strategic opportunity for you to redevelop that center. So when you kind of provide some more details on that?', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. The -- yes, you're right, I can't speak to the specific tenant or the asset, frankly, other than to say, like I mentioned at the onset, that the lion's share of that termination fee, pretty much all but roughly $1 million, $1.5 million of that was from that single transaction. That transaction was an anchor location in terms of the type of space, but we do expect that to open up a really significant redevelopment opportunity. We are working on predevelopment and preplanning of that right now as well as entitlement."", ""Once we narrow down the scope and the exact cost and returns, which we expect to be, the returns to be in the low double-digit realm, we will disclose that in our pipeline. But it is a good opportunity. We're very glad to get that transaction completed."", 'Viktor Fediv -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', 'And then the second question, probably on leasing demand part. So given that department stores sales were weaker versus broad retail sales in 2023, do you expect more optimization to occur within that space? And have you had any conversations with your tenants about that already?', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""So I'm not quite sure I caught all of that question. I would say this, though, and this is probably a good thing. As we look into 2024, I would not expect us to put up the same type of volume that we did in 2023 because in all candor, we're running out of large-format inventory running out of boxes, big anchor locations. Over the last few years since 2021, we've leased about 2 million square feet and over 20 anchor locations."", ""So it's been very productive."", ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""Yes, I think you're going to continue to see the shift away from department stores and into other big box uses. You saw us open Shields Sporting Goods for example, in a former department store space. You'll see us open Art Museum in the former art-like theater space. We're going to continue to see different types of uses, diversified uses, taking the department store space and converting that into other uses that frankly drive more sales and traffic."", ""That's a trend we've seen accelerating over the last five years, and that is going to continue as we go forward."", 'Viktor Fediv -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', 'It makes sense. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Your line is now open.', 'Samir Khanal -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Hi, everybody. Tom, congratulations on your retirement. We will miss you. So Scott, just on same-store NOI guidance here.', ""Certainly, leasing is very strong. The pipeline looks great in the '24. But I just want to kind of dive into the same-store NOI growth that is moderating in '24. Maybe help us think through the drivers of that lower growth in '24 at this time."", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure, Samir. I'll walk through it. Obviously, great growth over the last three years, as I highlighted in my opening remarks. So for starters, we are dealing with some more challenging comps."", ""In addition, I would say operating expenses do remain relatively elevated when you think of things like insurance costs, security labor, I mentioned bad debts, those are all contributing to some headwind in same center that I would quantify it roughly 150 basis points or so, headwind in same center. We are -- given the robust leasing environment and remerchandising our space, we are taking space offline, so there is an element of downtime within that same center guidance. And I would estimate that kind of bracket a roughly 1% headwind in the same center. That's all positive, though, because we're taking underperforming merchants offline."", ""We're putting in much more attractive merchants, much more diversified uses that will draw traffic and better sales volumes at better rent levels. So that is what you typically see in a robust leasing environment. So those are really some of the major moving pieces. And then, of course, as we do with each and every year, we do embed some reserves for the unanticipated in our guide."", 'Samir Khanal -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'And just from a modeling perspective, help us think through G&A for the year and also percentage rents?', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure. G&A, I think if I were to point you to a run rate, we look at 2023, and I would expect maybe a marginal decline versus 2023 and 2024 across management company expenses, net revenues, rate expenses.', ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""One other thing to keep in mind on the G&A line, Samir, if you take a look at our proxy -- last proxy, Page 50, you'll see the combined compensation for Ed Coppola, Tom O'Hern, and from the 8-K, you'll be able to ascertain the compensation for Jackson. So that will be a fairly significant reduction in G&A just as a result of the CEO and president change."", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""And then, Samir, you also asked about percentage rents. If my memory is right, about 12 months ago, I said we do expect roughly a 15% to 20% decline in percentage rents into 2023 from 2022. And in fact, that played out. If you look at our percentage rents on a pro-rata basis, they were down about 16% in '23 versus '22."", ""And again, largely, that was a function of conversion of variable rent to fixed rent type structures. I think we worked through the vast majority of those at this point, Doug. I don't expect a lot more of that. As we look into 2024, and we're looking at percentage rent trends versus '23, I expect those to continue to tick down, but not nearly as significantly as they did in 2023."", ""We're estimating roughly about a mid-single-digit decline in percentage rents and some of that is just as you get escalations and base rents, you get an increase in breakpoint. So there's a natural transition of variable rent to fixed rent on that basis. But I don't expect the type of leasing activity converting variable to fixed rent that we had in 2023 at all."", 'Samir Khanal -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Your line is open.', 'Floris van Dijkum -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, guys. Can you hear me?', ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", 'We can hear you, Floris. Loud and clear.', 'Floris van Dijkum -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', 'Great. Tom, congrats on the retirement. Good luck in your next venture, whatever you wind up doing.', ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""Thank you, Floris. I remember you when you were 25 and fresh out of UVA, and we're going to visit malls in Northern California."", 'Floris van Dijkum -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', ""I remember that that was -- and by the way, that was one of my lowlights actually, as some of you might have heard -- I don't know I won't share that on this call, but -- but yes, I do remember that. That was a memorable time. I had, I guess, two questions for you. Number one, if you can -- one of the issues, I guess, with the mall sector, and you're not unique."", ""I think some of your peers have had to grapple with this as well. But is the people don't think there's going to be much growth in the center. Can you maybe touch on -- obviously, the underlying growth was very strong last year, you're expecting a little bit of a slowdown this year, probably with some conservatism baked in, I would imagine. But maybe talk a little bit about some of the key drivers for growth."", ""Obviously, you touched upon the S&O pipeline. Maybe can you give a little bit more color on what percentage of that S&O pipeline, for example, is luxury tenants? I know there's a big win coming online at Scottsdale. How much of a driver of growth is that potentially for you going forward?"", ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""Well, I'll let Doug talk about luxury in a second, Floris. But as for people saying they don't see the growth in the mall sector, then they're clearly ignoring the facts. All you have to do is look at record leasing volumes in '22 and '23 and then drill down a little deeper and look at the types of tenants that are coming in, replacing traditional retail. This isn't apparel retail."", ""This isn't footwear. These are new uses, new and creative food and beverage like Pinstripes, Lifetime Fitness, for example, very actively coming in, and they can generate an additional 5,000 to the center. We just that one tenant alone, adding our 10 museum, they expect to have 1 million visitors per year coming to the top level of Santa Monica place. So there are a lot of exciting new uses that, frankly, we didn't have 10 years ago."", ""So I think whoever said they didn't see the growth driving to the mall business, the A-quality mall business was sadly mistaken because all these new uses are driving traffic, they're driving sales, they're driving productivity. They're driving rent and they're going to drive NOI."", 'Doug Healey -- Senior Executive Vice President, Leasing', ""Floris, it's Doug. With regard to your specific questions about luxury, as you know, a few years back, we finished the luxury wing at Scottsdale Fashion Square and the Neiman Marcus wing. And late last year, early this year, we're now focusing on bringing luxury -- global luxury to the Nordstrom Wing. I think a few calls ago, we announced Hermes, which is the bellwether tenant for that property, and we'll be announcing more over the next several months."", ""But to Tom's point, I talked about the leasing pipeline all the time. And it's 2.2 million square feet. It's going to open over the next two and a half years. Those are phenomenal numbers."", ""But the thing that really excites me is the uses we're going to be bringing. So that just all new uses, new exciting uses, you think about Din Tai Fung and you think about Elephante, True Food Kitchen, Vuori, H&M, Primark, Dave, and Buster's, Kiln, Lifetime Fitness, Tom mentioned Pinstripes, Target, Level 99. I mean, that's really the beauty of this pipeline, not just the metrics, but the depth and breadth of uses that we're bringing to our town centers over the next two, two and a half years."", 'Floris van Dijkum -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', ""Great. Maybe a follow-up with Scott. I know you mentioned that Niagara is going to get refinanced, and that might surprise some people myself included, who thought that might transition back. I know you probably can't say a whole lot, but does this mean that you will be investing leasing capital in this asset on a going forward basis? And what do you think that can do to the operations for this property going forward as well?"", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Floris, you're right. I can't speak in too much detail because the transaction is still in process. We do expect to secure a multiyear extension of that."", ""The asset still does generate some FFO. It certainly has its challenges given its market positioning with north of the border in Canada and the local market. There still is some opportunities for that asset, and we'll continue to -- continue to capitalize on those opportunities. But the bottom line is it's a negotiation that's still in process."", ""It's earnings accretive to retain that asset, and we'll report back once we close."", 'Floris van Dijkum -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', 'Thanks, Scott.', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure.', 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Todd Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Hi. Thanks. First, Tom, Ed, congrats on your run, best of luck in retirement. Let me -- first, I just wanted to take a stab at asking a prior question.', ""I realize Jackson has not started yet.

He'll be starting soon, and you can ask him directly, but I know he does like our strategy of densifying and diversifying our high-quality town centers and he found that very interesting and appealing. Other things he may be considering I will leave to him and let him articulate directly to you and others on this call."", 'Todd Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""OK. And Tom, you're staying on for a few months as an advisor, what kind of time line would you expect for Jackson to get sort of fully situated with the platform, touring assets, markets meeting with key retailers? What's the process like for him really stepping into the CEO role?"", ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""Well, many of you on call know him. I mean, he's going to hit the ground running. I can guarantee you that. So I think there'll be a lot of travel visiting our offices, visiting our people getting going."", ""Ed and I are still on the board through our current term, which runs through May. So people have access to both of us and I imagine he's going to be a very quick study and hit the ground running. So I think that will all happen very, very quickly. And he's already fairly familiar with the Company, did his due diligence and I can almost give to you, he will get it faster."", 'Todd Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""OK. That's helpful. And if I could just get one in for Doug. I appreciate the detail around the S&O pipeline and the lease signings and LOIs that you've executed around the '24 expirations."", ""Can you talk about your expectation for tenant retention during the year and maybe discuss any known move-outs or post-holiday season -- seasonality that you're expecting this year relative to the last few years where there's been a lot less seasonality than traditionally is?"", 'Doug Healey -- Senior Executive Vice President, Leasing', ""Todd, it's Doug. Thank you. I think -- and Scott jump in here. But I think in 2024, our expectation is between 90% and 95% tenant retention."", 'Meaning our expirations -- our 2024 expirations between 90% and 95%, we believe, will retain.', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""I think the second part of your question was regarding any unanticipated or just fall out following the holiday. And I won't say there -- I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary. If we looked at, say, the 2016 through 2019 period, we had some precursor certainly in the fall of tenants that were likely to close, and they were closing in fairly significant routes. We have not had that for the last few years at all."", ""And I can't think of any retailer that said, look, we're going to shut down five or six stores following the holiday season. Doug?"", 'Doug Healey -- Senior Executive Vice President, Leasing', ""Yes. Todd, we've talked about this a lot. I mean many of the retailers that were suffering pre-pandemic just didn't make it through pandemic. And those that came through, came through in a very healthy way."", ""And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's a very, very healthy retailer environment out there with very strong balance sheets. I think the retailers -- I know the retailers in 2023 and into 2024 already speaking about managing the inventory levels, which is hugely important for the profitability and for the margins which actually makes them stronger. So we're not seeing really any pullback and our watch list is as low as it's ever been in 20 years. So I don't anticipate anything, anything unusual in 2024, if you will."", 'Todd Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'OK. Great.

Just curious, what's embedded in the 2024 guidance for NOI margin improvement relative to what you had in 2023?"", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, Mike, I think we'll see continued margin improvement. We've got improvement in rental rate. We've got growth in occupancy. Obviously, the pipeline will start to add more and more as we get toward the latter half of the year."", ""It's still a pretty thick pipeline. In fact, I think the pipeline yields roughly $64 million, $65 million of incremental rent over existing uses. So that will be heavy in the second half. Conversely, like I said, we've got operating expenses continue to be somewhat of a drag, not a huge drag, but somewhat of a drag."", ""So -- but I do think by the time we get to the end of the year, you'll see continued margin improvement year over year."", 'Mike Mueller -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'OK.

And given the depth of the pipeline, any one of these deals we're approaching, whether it's Tysons or Danbury. To the extent we have a tenant that's not yet come online, we do have to set aside that capital."", ""It's effectively -- I guess, when you think about it, it's prefunding that capital and then we drop back down over the next 6 to 12 months. And so for instance, for Tysons, I think there was an incremental $40 million, give or take, of liquidity. But a lot of that liquidity was soaked up in capex reserves for a lot of restaurant uses. We've recently discussed Level 99, which is a new entertainment use on the east side of the center."", ""So we did have to set aside the anticipated leasing capital to bring that use to opening and paying rent. But other than that, no, I'd say that the environment is pretty normalized. And we're getting deals done again, liquidity is back open. I'm happy to say that we probably accounted for roughly 25% of the volume that occurred in CMBS, which was about a little over $7 billion of transactions in 2023."", ""So, the markets are open and functional and as you can see from the rates somewhere in the mid-6s is where we've been transacting."", 'Ki Bin Kim -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'And what is like a broad refinance rate that we should assume for 2024 refinancing?', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""I'd say we've been transacting in the mid-6s, and that's probably representative of where we'll be this year. We'll have to see what the Fed has in store for us for the next 12 months. But based on where we see the forward curve, that's probably a reasonable expectation."", 'Ki Bin Kim -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.', 'Ravi Vaidya -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Hi, guys. This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. I hope you guys are doing well. Just had one or two questions here.', ""Regarding leverage, can you please provide a full year -- end of year '24 target? And would you consider issuing equity at current prices? I believe at the Investor Day, you referenced that you were in -- you weren't looking to issue equity until the previous target, which is around $18 a share, and we're getting close to that at this point. So I just wanted to follow up on that."", ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""Ravi, I'll take the second half of that question. We always reserve the right to issue equity. So I'm not going to give you a hard and fast rule in terms of a dollar amount. You've seen us in the past, judiciously use our ATM, and we have an ATM in place today, and that's another tool in the capital toolkit that we would keep available to us."", ""So it's certainly possible. And look, we're very focused on delevering over time. That can happen in a few ways, one of which is to drive same-center NOI up, which we fully plan to do. And the other way to effectively reduce debt-to-EBITDA is via equity leases."", ""So we wouldn't preclude ourselves from doing that. We do not have any of that in the guidance, but that's consistent with past practice as well. Scott, do you want to comment on leverage?"", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Sure, Ravi. To your first part of your question, I think we could see 40 to 50 basis points of improvement in leverage by the time we get to the end of the year. Roughly 8.2 times is kind of where we're triangulating based on the business plan today."", 'Ravi Vaidya -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thank you.', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure.', 'Operator', 'One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Caitlin Burrows -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Hi. Good morning there and congrats, Tom, on your retirement. Maybe starting with Santa Monica Place in Scottsdale Fashion Square, I feel like the expected openings are getting closer on those. And I think combined, they're supposed to have an incremental NOI of around $50 million at your share."", ""So I'm just wondering if you can give some further detail on the timing of recognizing that NOI? Like could it start in the first half of this year? Or any other details you can give?"", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Caitlin, both of those projects are going to start to open in late '24, early '25. So, I would say you'll see a full -- for the most part, you'll see a full impact in 2025, maybe a little bit of bleed into '26. But looking at those individually, Scottsdale, will start to open up a lot of those uses in fall, the renovation for that project."", ""I think most of the scaffolding will be down and the physical work will be done by the time we get to the end of the quarter. But the -- in terms of new tenants coming online, it will start to come online in the fourth quarter, and we'll see kind of the full year effect in '25. Santa Monica, we've got some exciting uses coming first level, Club Studio, which is high end fitness, third level, Arte, both of those are going to be done in the first half of 2025. So, you'll see some bleed into 2026 there."", 'Din Tai Fung will also be a use that we hope to get online either at the end of this year, beginning of next year. So, all those are very accretive leases that we expect to be on board, certainly by second quarter of 2025.', 'Caitlin Burrows -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Got it. And maybe you guys talked earlier in the call about how percent rents were down in '23 because more was being shifted to base rents, which makes sense. I was wondering if you could go through any details on how much that kind of phenomenon impacted leasing spreads like that the expiring ABR might have been lower and related kind of the level of leasing spreads that you reported in 4Q of almost 20%. Do you think that's sustainable?"", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure. Great question. Yes. Certainly, if you look at our expiring rents in 2023, they were a lot lower than what we expected in 2024.', ""And that was really driven again by all those shorter-term deals that we did during COVID, which had more variable rent and we're accessing those throughout 2023 and renewing those on a longer term more typical fixed rent structure. So as we reported trailing 12%, 17% spreads at the end of the year, and I would expect those base rent spreads to be roughly 50% of that level in 2024. Really, again, just a function of a relatively artificially low base rent expiring in '23 and a more normalized level of base rent expiring in 2024."", 'Caitlin Burrows -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thanks.', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure.', 'Operator', 'One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.', 'Nick Joseph -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Thank you. Just hoping you could walk through the capital needs and the funding plan for leasing-related capex and any incremental redevelopment in 2024.', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. I did mentioned in my opening remarks, Nick, good afternoon -- that we do expect after recurring capex and leasing costs to still have generated roughly $300 million of operating cash flow before payment of dividend. As I look at '24, '25, '26 development pipeline, I think, will range between $150 million to $200 million over those three years, and we're probably somewhere around that midpoint of that for 2024. We are -- we've got probably eight to nine -- 10 anchor boxes that we continue to work on that will largely be retenanted and completed by the end of the year but will also be set in the table for some larger-scale redevelopments, potentially Green Acres, potentially FlatIron for 2025 and 2026."", ""So that will give you an idea of some of the character of what we're spending on."", 'Nick Joseph -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.', 'Alexander Goldfarb -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""I guess it's still good morning out there. Tom and Eddie certainly for two decades of working with you guys in REIT land. It's been awesome and we'll miss our NAREIT interaction. So I wish you guys the best in your next endeavor."", 'So I have two questions. The first question is, Scott, on the Danbury mall loan, you know how much I like that mall. Can you just help us walk through and interpret the $155 million new loan relative to the value of that mall? Just given the sales that it does and the dominance in that northern region would think that the loan is under-levered relative to the value of the asset. Obviously, the market today is a tough market to do debt.', 'So maybe just some perspective around how we should interpret the loan balance relative to where the market value of that asset would be sort of in normal times, obviously, not right now when people are skittish.', 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Yes, it's a great asset. It's virtually 100% occupied. I think there's one or two available storefronts."", ""So very happy to get a 10-year deal on it, stagger out that maturity, etc., etc., especially at a very attractive rate. The loan to value, if I recall correctly, was in the low 40s based on appraisal. We typically, as you know, from following us many years, we typically finance in the 55% realm. So yes, there's a little bit of liquidity on the table, but it's the state of the market today."", ""And I think it was a great execution hitting a window. And recall, we've been trying to finance that thing through a difficult capital market environment for almost two years. So it was really nice to be able to window and execute well at a good rate."", 'Alexander Goldfarb -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'OK. And then the second question is on the JV, the Freehold and Chandler JV, you bought out Freehold, but Chandler still seems to be a JV. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about what drove the JV to sort of cleave off the asset? I think you guys said $5.6 million that you used to acquire that. What was unique about that at it versus Chandler that still is in JV? Or should we expect something to happen in the near future on Chandler as well?', ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""Alex, really, we can't comment on what motivated or didn't motivate our partner in that case. It was really their decision. But when given the opportunity, we like the economics, we like the asset. We had a chance to do that on Chandler, but that was really driven by them and their preference."", 'Alexander Goldfarb -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you, Tom.', 'Operator', 'One minute for the next question. The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.', 'Ronald Kamdem -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Hey. Congrats Tom and Ed. Just two quick ones for me. Just on -- going back to the management addition, obviously, can't comment for Jackson."", ""But just about the process. The question really is, is there any sort of specific skill set or experience that you guys are looking for? And can you just comment on why we're sort of now the right time for this transition? Just trying to get a little bit more color around sort of the process that you guys are looking for?"", ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""Yes, Ron, I'll refer you to the press release and the 8-K. We did an exhaustive search. We used Ferguson Partners, very well-known firm that specializes in executive recruitment and we considered a lot of candidates. Those of you that know Jackson know he's very qualified and very capable, and I think we've got an outstanding replacement."", ""In terms of the timing, every CEO should really go out when their company is in a good spot and when they have their health. So that's why it's good timing. Macerich is in great shape and I've got my health. So this is the perfect time for me to move on to all those things that I put on the back burner for the last 30 years."", 'Ronald Kamdem -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Understood. And then one on -- so I saw the Green Acres Mall redevelopment announcement, I think, earlier this, I guess, last week or earlier this January, but I didn't see it in the supplemental. Is there -- is that going to be a large project? Like how should we think about the economics and returns on that? Or should we just wait for that to be at it?"", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, it's a wait. I think you'll see it hitting the pipeline. We are in predevelopment and entitlement mode right now. It's going to be a very attractive project."", ""Frankly, that's a gem from the two assets that we acquired back in the 2012, 2013 time frame. Green Acres has performed extremely well. We added a power center. We've been able to retenant the mall."", ""In total, the entire property, the entire campus generates over $1 billion of sales and we're really, really excited to bring this next phase, but we're studying it, and it will hit the pipeline over the next few quarters."", 'Ronald Kamdem -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""All right. That's it for me. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Tom for closing remarks.', ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", ""Thank you, Michelle. Thank all of you for joining us today. All kidding aside, I would like to say that it's been my pleasure to work with you, and I will miss all of you. As I approach retirement, I'm highly confident in the future of the company under the leadership of Jackson, our board of directors, and the balance of our incredibly talented leadership team here at Macerich."", 'I wish you all the best.', 'Operator', '[Operator signoff]', 'Duration: 0 minutes', 'Samantha Greening -- Director, Investor Relations', ""Tom O'Hern -- Chief Executive Officer"", 'Scott Kingsmore -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Doug Healey -- Senior Executive Vice President, Leasing', 'Jeff Spector -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Viktor Fediv -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', 'Samir Khanal -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Floris van Dijkum -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst', 'Todd Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Mike Mueller -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Ki Bin Kim -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'Ravi Vaidya -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Caitlin Burrows -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Nick Joseph -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Alexander Goldfarb -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Ronald Kamdem -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'More MAC analysis', 'All earnings call transcripts', ""This article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.

While air travel demand is particularly strong on the leisure front, it is heartening to note that business demand has made an encouraging comeback. The decline in fuel expenses represents another tailwind for the industry.Driven by the abovementioned positives, investors interested in the industry would do well to keep stocks like Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and SkyWest on their radar.', 'The Zacks Airline industry players are engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally.

While air travel demand is particularly strong on the leisure front, it is heartening to note that business demand has made an encouraging comeback. The decline in fuel expenses represents another tailwind for the industry.\xa0Driven by the abovementioned positives,\xa0investors interested in the industry would do well to keep stocks like\xa0Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines\xa0AAL and SkyWest SKYW on their radar.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Airline industry players are engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Their operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers. Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of these companies is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a beating. However, air travel demand is extremely rosy now. The focus on boosting cargo revenues is a positive, too.', ""Factors Relevant to the Industry's Fortunes"", 'Rosy Air Traffic Scenario:\xa0It is a well-documented fact that air travel demand has bounced back strongly from the pandemic lows. The removal of COVID-related restrictions aided air travel, which is now strong on the international front as well. People are again resorting to air travel as they resume their normal activities.', 'Driven by upbeat passenger volumes, the International Air Transport Association or IATA has given a rosy 2024 forecast for airlines across the globe. Per IATA, the net profit of airlines across the globe is likely to be\xa0$25.7 billion\xa0in 2024, suggesting a net profit margin of 2.7%. The top line next year is anticipated to be $964 billion, implying a 7.6% increase from 2023’s estimate. With people again taking to the skies, the greatest driver of top-line improvement is passenger revenues. Per IATA, 4.7 billion people are expected to travel in 2024, which is even higher than the 2019 (pre-pandemic) reading of $4.5 billion. Passenger revenues for the current year are anticipated to be $717 billion.', 'Decline in Fuel Costs:\xa0The decline in fuel expenses is another tailwind for the industry. Notably, oil price declined 10% in the October-December period. This bodes well for the bottom-line growth of airlines. This is because fuel expenses are a significant input cost for airline stocks.', ""Concerns about China and Germany's economic trajectories, high interest environments and record non-OPEC production from the United States, Canada, Brazil, Norway and Guyana, coupled with increased output in Iran, contributed to oil’s supply glut and the resultant price decline."", 'Uptick in Labor Costs: The increase in expenses on the labor front represents a major headwind for airlines. With U.S. airlines grappling with a labor shortage in the post-COVID-19 high-demand scenario, the bargaining power of various labor groups has naturally increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked in the space. This is resulting in a spike in labor costs.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Signals Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Airline industry is a 32-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), by way of a worked example."", 'Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sherwin-Williams is:', '64% = US$2.4b ÷ US$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.64 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Sherwin-Williams has a superior ROE than the average (13%) in the Chemicals industry.', 'That is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.', 'Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.', ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by Sherwin-Williams, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.65. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", ""Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company."", 'But note: Sherwin-Williams may not be the best stock to buy.

In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.0%. Relative to the current share price of US$122, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing.

If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at American Water Works Company as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Along this journey, we articulated our company's Purpose, to Power an Inclusive Future for All."", 'Clearly define your intended impacts', ""There are many ways to define impact, so it's important to get clear about how your company will define and measure it."", 'We worked with our nonprofit partners to develop a shared definition of positive impact. Together, we agreed that positive impact occurs when an individual has gained access to a critical resource, learned something, or participated in a meaningful way.', ""For example, for job seekers, positive impact is achieved by completing a training program and obtaining a job that provides stable and sufficient income. For students, it's gaining knowledge and demonstrating proficiency in the subject matter. And for a community in need of water, it's having a reliable, affordable source of clean drinking water that is available to all people within the community."", 'Build a rigorous tracking methodology', 'Tracking and validating impact is a complex but crucial process. This is critical for transparency and accurate reporting, and determining whether you are having the desired impact.', 'Our methodology focused on finding a balance between rigor to ensure consistency and accuracy and meeting the needs of our nonprofit grant partners.', 'In addition to validating positive impact, our methodology ensures each person counted is unique, and that they are only counted once over time. For example, some people may benefit from multiple programs within a year or may benefit from the same program over multiple years - they are only counted once within the timeframe of our One Billion Lives goal.', 'We recognized that we could not always accurately quantify the impact of some categories within our Social Impact investments. To address this, we did not include some of our social impact grants where the nonprofit partner did not have a way to count unique individuals positively impacted. This was the case, for example, with some of our nonprofit partners who address food insecurity - as they do not track unique individuals who receive support.', 'Cisco engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to conduct an independent limited assurance of our progress toward our goal and our accompanying methodology and validation processes between FY16-FY22, ensuring our path to one billion was sound. We applied the same approach and methodology in FY23.', 'Invest in potential', 'With an audacious goal, clear definitions of impact, and a rigorous methodology in place, we turned our attention to executing against our investment model.', 'Cisco focuses on getting in early - providing critical seed funding to promising nonprofits to ideate, create, and test tech-enabled solutions. While investing in proven solutions responds to immediate needs, identifying and investing in new and innovative solutions can help scale and amplify your impact over time.', 'Our strategy of investing in tech-enabled solutions stems from who we are. As a technology company, we believe in the power of technology to connect the unconnected, and also to have impact at scale.', 'We support our nonprofit partners beyond cash grant funding. We donate our technology to enable our partners to deliver their offerings more securely and effectively and connect them to subject matter experts across the company, and to key organizations, partners, and funders. We do this to ensure that our partners can have sustained impact well beyond the lifecycle of our engagement with them.', 'Our Social Impact Grant partners get the time, space, funding, and flexibility to test their solutions. As those solutions are validated, we provide continued support to help our partners replicate those solutions to new geographies and scale to reach more people. Cisco gains a better understanding of the challenge they are solving and what it takes to drive true impact. We all grow from innovating - together.', ""What's next?"", ""Today, we are sharing with you our Blueprint to One Billion. As we contemplate our next inspired goal, we're committed to sharing more about what we've learned in positively impacting one billion lives and to understanding more about the challenges faced by communities around the world. We will share stories of our partners, the work they do, the solutions we have funded, and the lives that have been impacted as a result."", 'Explore the inspiring stories within our goal to positively impact One Billion Lives', ""Go deeper in understanding all that Cisco is doing to bring the power of purpose to life within Cisco's FY23 Purpose Report"", ""Hear from Brian Tippens and Guy Diedrich how we're continuing to expand our approach to positive impact in The next one billion lives"", 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:', 'Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This seller of routers, switches, software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.84 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.6%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $12.72 billion, down 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.64% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cisco?', ""For Cisco, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.98%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cisco will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cisco would post earnings of $1.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.11, delivering a surprise of +7.77%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Cisco doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

After the pandemic-induced stint of working in isolation, they’re most excited by the prospect of collaborating, brainstorming, and feeling a sense of belonging which you can’t quite get while sat on a sofa and connecting over Slack five days a week.', 'Instead of digging their heels in because they don’t want to make the commute, the data uncovered that most RTO-related reluctance is centered around the workplace not being properly equipped for hybrid work.', 'Of the employers surveyed, nearly 80% have summoned their staff back to the office (on a part-time basis, at least) but one in three employees feel like the office isn’t ready for their return.', 'Much has changed since the government mandated workers to work from home in 2020. Most meetings are now Zoom-centric, meanwhile, offices have become collaboration hubs of sorts.', 'So ignoring these shifts and expecting workers to return to the old ways of working isn’t sitting well with staff.', 'For more than 50% of those surveyed, their beef with the office is that too much space is dedicated to working alone.', 'They described the common office layout—rows of desks with a couple of meeting rooms dotted around the building—as “counter-productive”.', 'Instead, they want a space that is more conducive to collaboration and culture-building.', 'After all, that’s the reason workers on a hybrid pattern are spending their time and money to head into the office rather than work in solitary at home.', 'Existing conference rooms are not working for them either: 73% of the employees surveyed do not feel current meeting rooms enhance in-office productivity.', 'Meanwhile, even most employers agreed that the experience of those dialing into meetings remotely isn’t quite consistent with that of in-office participants.', '“Employers recognize a gap, and if they don’t make the office a magnet, they will not be able to mandate people returning to the office,” the report warns.', 'Although 85% of employers know that making their workspace fit for the new world of work is key to attracting and retaining talent, just 65% of the employers surveyed have plans to update their workspace, including implementing hybrid work technology, in the next 2 years.', 'Despite being arguably best placed to allow their workforce to work from home, many tech companies started issuing return-to-office mandates last year.', 'So to entice their teams to collaborate in person a few days a week, the likes of Cisco and Zoom have had to prove their offices are a destination worth commuting to.', 'At Zoom’s new London HQ which Fortune visited last Summer ahead of its grand opening, the 15,000-square-foot site is seamlessly kitted out with the latest technology: A virtual map with floating heads displays which desks are taken, meanwhile, one giant screen sits in the middle of the office for all-hands-on calls with the founder Eric Yuan.', 'As Cisco’s CEO Chuck Robbins pointed out: Employers asking their workers to come into the office more often, only to sit at a desk and do video meetings, don’t have a leg to stand on.', '“They could do that from home.""', 'It’s why the company has been rebranding its offices as “collaboration centers”.', ""For example, in Cisco's Atlanta office which opened last year, the majority of the hub’s square footage is dedicated to communal gatherings and team-based work."", 'Meeting rooms have been decked out with the latest video conference system that follows each speaker’s voice and points the camera to whoever is talking.', 'In a reversal of what was previously the norm, just 10% of the space is reserved for working alone.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"
