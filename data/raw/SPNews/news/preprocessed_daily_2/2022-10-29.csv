The bottom line increased 9% year over year despite high costs.Total revenues of $2,166.5 million also outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,078.2 million. The top line climbed 14.2% year over year due to higher segmental revenues. Organic sales were up 13.9% year over year.Segmental ResultsThe company has two reportable segments Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. Other businesses like Uniform Direct Sale and Fire Protection Services are included in All Other. Quarterly sales data is briefly discussed below.Revenues from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment (representing 78.4% of the reported quarter’s net sales) were $1,697.77 million, increasing 12.6% year over year.Revenues from the First Aid and Safety Services segment (representing 10.8% of the reported quarter’s net sales) totaled $234.16 million, increasing 17.6% year over year.Revenues from the All Other business (representing 10.8% of the reported quarter’s net sales) were $226.25 million, increasing 23.7% year over year.Margin ProfileIn the quarter under review, Cintas’ cost of sales (comprising costs related to uniform rental and facility services and others) increased 14.5% year over year to $1,138.34 million.

Adjusted effective tax rate in the period is expected to be approximately 20% compared with 17.9% in fiscal year 2022. The company expects this higher tax rate to impact earnings by around 32 cents. Due to higher interest rates, interest expenses are expected to increase to approximately $110 million in fiscal 2023 from $88.8 million in fiscal 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresAt this time, Cintas has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Cintas has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On an underlying basis, growth was 6.1%. In the United States, TAVR procedures increased in mid-single digits year over year.

The underlying revenue uptick resulted from the increased uptake of the company's broad portfolio of Smart Recovery products, including FloTrac and ClearSight sensors with the Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm.Story continuesMarginsIn the third quarter, gross profit was $1.07 billion, up 6.7%. The gross margin expanded 455 basis points (bps) to 80.8%.Our model projected a gross margin of 79.5% for Q3.The company-provided adjusted gross margin was 81%, a 470 basis-point expansion year over year. This increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of the company's foreign exchange program, which comprises natural hedges and hedge contract gains to offset the sales impact of the weakening of the euro and yen against the dollar.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 3.5% year over year to $377.3 million.

Long-term debt was $596.2 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022, similar to the second-quarter long-term debt level.GuidanceThe company has updated its guidance for full-year 2022.The company expects full-year 2022 adjusted earnings per share to grow in the range of $2.40to $2.50 (compared with the lower end of its originalguidance range of $2.50-$2.65). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $2.51.The full-year 2022 sales expectation was reiterated in the range of $5.35-$5.55 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $5.47 billion.For the fourth quarter, Edwards projects year-over-year and sequential sales growth at CER.  The company expects reported sales and adjusted EPS to be similar to the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 66 cents while the same for revenues is $1.42 billion.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the third quarter of 2022, with earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company registered year-over-year growth on both fronts.The company registered strong underlying growth across all product groups. However, a slower-than-expected recovery of the U.S. hospital staffing trend and COVID-19 restrictions in Japan marred the growth. Adjusted EPS grew despite aggressive investment in R&amp;D and commercial infrastructure to support new therapies.However, the uptick in operating costs is worrying. The choppy market conditions due to the continued foreign exchange impact and COVID-related hospital staffing issues are concerning. The company updated its EPS  outlook for full-year 2022, taking these macroeconomic challenges into account.Zacks Rank and Key PicksEdwards Lifesciences currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Elevance Health Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) insiders sold US$9.4m worth of stock last year which shareholders may not want to overlook,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-insiders-130009105.html,1666962009,STORY,['WMT'],"[While Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shareholders have had a good week with the stock up 5.0%, they shouldn't let their guards down. Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$9.4m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Walmart The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At WalmartIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the , M. Biggs, sold US$3.1m worth of shares at a price of US$140 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$141). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.2% of M. Biggs's holding.Insiders in Walmart didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of WalmartLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Walmart insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$3.5b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Walmart Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Walmart shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Walmart insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Walmart.

In the previous quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 87.5%.How are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 22 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 633.3% from 3 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $3,259 million. The metric suggests an increase of 20.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.MGM Resorts International Price and EPS Surprise MGM Resorts International Price and EPS SurpriseMGM Resorts International price-eps-surprise | MGM Resorts International Quote Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors to NoteMGM Resorts’ third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong leisure demand and better convention business in the Las Vegas market. During the previous quarter, the company reported solid performance in its regional properties, owing to its premium offerings and strength in gaming spend levels. Also, it reported strong weekend occupancies and an average daily rate. Given a rebound in convention business, increased international flight capacity and a robust event calendar, the momentum is likely to have continued in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues at Las Vegas Strip and Regional operations is pegged at $1,970 million and $934 million, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 42.7% and 1%, respectively.Solid contributions from rooms and food and beverage are likely to have driven the company’s third quarter top-line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at rooms and food and beverage is pegged at $744 million and $614 million, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 51.8% and 47.6%, respectively.Increased focus on BetMGM is expected to have driven incremental earnings between its brick-and-mortar and online channels in the third quarter. During the previous quarter, the company revealed that BetMGM continues to gain market share. In second-quarter 2022, BetMGM rolled out its offerings in Ontario. It also announced a partnership with Carnival cruises to provide onboard ship betting and gaming under the BetMGM brand. As of May 2022, BetMGM achieved a market share of 21% in the U.S. sports betting and the iGaming space. Given the continued development progress and initiatives to improve the interface and customer experience, the momentum is likely to have continued in the third quarter.However, limited entrance in the Macau region and public health policies are likely to have affected operations in the third quarter. This and the absence of frictionless movement between Macau, Hong Kong and Mainland China is likely to have influenced the pace of recovery in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MGM China is pegged at $213 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 26.3%. Increased expenses related to investments in IT and digital are likely to have hurt margins in the third quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for MGM Resorts this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

(NASDAQ:META) stock at an average sell price of US$196 during the past year. The company’s market cap plunged by US$86b after price dropped by 24% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms Meta Platforms Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, for US$2.3m worth of shares, at about US$199 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$99.20. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Meta Platforms insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Specifically, insiders ditched US$3.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of Meta PlatformsI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Meta Platforms insiders own about US$43b worth of shares (which is 16% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Meta Platforms Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Meta Platforms stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

META missed earnings expectations by -13% at $1.64 per share. This was after Altimeter Capital called for the company to focus on its core business Facebook.CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s somewhat brazen comments that the company would continue its metaverse push helped spark the selloff. This came despite many thinking the Metaverse spending could take away from core revenue and unnecessarily increase costs amid an already tough operating environment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the earnings miss, sales beat expectations by 1% at $27.40 billion to show operating costs are indeed having an ill effect on the company’s bottom line. META has now tumbled 72% from its highs after the post-earnings decline this week and its lowest levels since 2016.Facebook Vs. MetaverseFacebook accounts for the majority of Meta Platforms revenue through advertising. Earnings are starting to decline with the company focusing on building the Metaverse, which is not profitable at this point. As we can see from the nearby chart, Meta’s capital expenditures, a big part of which is spent on the Metaverse, are skyrocketing to the disappointment of many shareholders. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBefore Q3 earnings, one of META’s larger shareholders Altimeter Capital stated Meta Platforms can get its “Mojo Back” by cuttings its headcount expense by at least 20%, and reducing its annual capital expenditures by at least $5 billion to $25 billion. Additionally, Altimeter Capital thinks Meta Platforms should invest no more than $5 billion annually in the Metaverse and shift its focus back to its core businesses. The announcement caused META shares to spike 7% before Q3 earnings but may have worsened the selloff after the company reiterated its intention to expand the Metaverse.Despite the disappointment, META was not alone with fellow big tech giants Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon AMZN also sinking after earnings this week.Story continuesPerformance &amp; Valuation Year to date META is now down -70% to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -21% and the Nasdaq’s -29%. Although the operating environment has been difficult for most tech stocks, shareholders have been calling out META for severely underperforming the Nasdaq. Investors are hoping META can get back to its stellar performance over the last decade. Over the last 10 years, META has still crushed the benchmark and the Nasdaq.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLong-term investors may see even more value in the stock with META trading just under $100 a share at its lowest level since 2016. At current levels, META has a P/E of 10.2X. This is much lower than the industry average of 43.4X. META trades at a significant discount to its decade-high of 325.5X and the median of 31.5X. Also, after traditionally trading at a premium well above the broader market, META now trades at what appears to be a discount to the benchmark’s 17.4X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutlookYear over year, META earnings are now expected to decline -32% but rise 10% in FY23 at $10.24 per share. Sales are expected to be down -2% this year but rise 4% in FY23 to $121.07 billion. The company’s outlook for Q4 revenue called for a range of $30-32 billion, with the Zacks Consensus estimate being $31.64 billion and earnings of $2.30 per share.Bottom Line META currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Internet-Software Industry is in the top 34% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Long-term investors could still be rewarded for holding the stock as it trades at an even steeper discount relative to its past and the benchmark. And the Zacks Average Price Target suggests 135% upside from current levels. Also, despite the decision to continue expanding the Metaverse, Facebook’s daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) did increase by 3% and 2% during September. DAUs were close to 2 billion and marketers will certainly continue to see value in the platform.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Energy Information Administration reporting just last week that the country had only 25 days of reserves remaining. Now the Biden administration weighing options to avert a crisis, as we head towards the winter. For more, we're joined by OPIS Global Head of Energy Analysis, Tom Kloza. Tom, good to see you. By one metric, diesel levels lowest in 40 years. How concerned should we be?TOM KLOZA: Well, I think we're concerned. I'd be a lot more concerned if this were the end of November or the end of December because diesel fuel and heating oil are the same molecules, essentially. And it's used a lot in the Northeast, and it's used in Europe. So we've seen prices in the Northeast go up by about $1.20 a gallon this month alone. And that's for diesel and for heating oil. The rest of the country, maybe $0.50. And I would say that in a couple of weeks when you get PPI numbers, that's going to haunt the inflationary aspects of those numbers.SEANA SMITH: Tom, how long do you see supplies remaining tight, then-- throughout the winter, at least?TOM KLOZA: I think so. If we get a mild winter, it really alters the calculus. And we do have some time now. It's probably worthwhile that we see these-- the use of the word ""shortage,"" as opposed to tightness or whatever, because something does need to happen. The problem is December 5 is when the European Union essentially begins boycotting or banning Russian oil. And Russian crude oil and Russian diesel are pretty much necessary for Europe and most of the North Atlantic.So it's going to be very, very touch and go. I would submit that maybe in the next 40 days, we don't see much short selling in the market. And like all markets, it needs short selling. So we're going to be very, very high up there. And again, I think it's bad for inflation. Everything moves across the country by either vessels, which use diesel now in their mix, trains, and of course, trucks. And it's very expensive with $5.50 to $6 prices out there.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Tom, speaking of Europe, we all talked for weeks, if not months, about a coming energy crisis in Europe. And now European natural gas prices plummeting. They don't even know what to do with it because supplies are full. Is it too early to say coast is clear?TOM KLOZA: Yeah, I think it's way too early. Now, it does tell you what happens with these markets that make parabolic moves. I mean, natural gas went from the equivalent of, like, $100 a barrel to $500 a barrel at the end of August. And now it's back to about 1/3 of that.So the same thing could happen in the United States. We're going to see the refiners get back in gear in the next month. They've had a lot of maintenance in October. They're going to make more gasoline, but they're really going to try to make more diesel, jet fuel, and heating oil because they're making $60, $70, $80, $90, $100 a barrel. They're making their fourth quarter margins right now in the first month of that quarter.SEANA SMITH: So, Tom, when you take a look at Europe, it sounds like it's more of a sigh of relief, rather than the fact that maybe Europe policymakers should be complacent. I guess what should they be doing or could they be doing to make sure the situation doesn't get significantly worse throughout the winter?TOM KLOZA: I think they're doing everything they can do right now. I mean, an embargo or a boycott is going to be very, very uncertain. And we don't really know what's going to happen. I mean, we have a desperate despot in charge of Russia, and he could cut off some of the supplies that would ordinarily go to Europe or some other countries. So there's a lot of uncertainty. And I don't think you'll see much selling in the market between now and December 5.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, I'd be remiss, Tom, if I didn't ask you about the Twitter back and forth between Exxon and President Biden. Exxon CEO suggesting on Twitter that's exactly what they're doing in the form of returning profits to the American people in the form of their quarterly dividend. And the answer from President Biden was, can't believe I have to say this. Giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for American families. What's your take on this back and forth?TOM KLOZA: You know, my take on this is like, well, at my country club, we don't have any non-- under-- or unemployment. It's really tone deaf on the part of the Exxon CEO. I'm sorry. But giving money back to shareholders is not the equivalent of treating the people on the margins of society who are paying these prices for heating oil, diesel, kerosene, or whatever. He needs to speak to the people on Main Street, and not on Wall Street.SEANA SMITH: And Tom, to that point, taking a look at Main Street, we know Exxon just posted another record profit. But when you take a look at gas prices, they have come down quite a bit. Here we are today at 3.76. When you take a look out over the next couple of months to year end, are you confident we'll remain below 4 bucks a gallon?TOM KLOZA: Yeah, I think we're going to be OK on gasoline prices because companies like Exxon and all the refiners right now, they're going to be making so much money on the middle of the barrel, the diesel and the jet fuel, that they're going to make a lot of gasoline, probably more than they would intend to make.So I think we're OK. And in the months of December and January and even February, we use about 15% to 20% less gasoline than we use in the driving season. So the whole thing, again, is, in the next 90 days, we'll look not so much for a point of stasis, but the launch pad from which the prices go at the end of the first quarter to 2023 or in the spring.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Tom Kloza from OPIS, appreciate it. Enjoy the weekend, sir.TOM KLOZA: Thanks.]"

Diesel is the fuel trucks, trains and ships fill their tanks with to move goods closer to our homes and stores.While the national average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline we put in our cars has dropped about 24% from their record high in June, the price of diesel has only slipped 8%.Diesel prices used to be lower than gasoline, but that relationship has flipped over the years, and the spread between the two has widened and is likely to balloon this winter with diesel prices expected to surge, analysts said.Diesel is the main fuel used to power trucks, rails and vessels that transport all sorts of things from food to home goods to holiday gifts across the country. So, if diesel prices soar, there’s a good chance the price of all those items will, too.“The public are apoplectic when gas rises, but diesel has incredible impacts to inflation in the form of freight costs and surcharges,” Tom Kloza, Opis global head of energy analysis, said. Why are diesel prices so high?Supply and demand.""Supply is constrained partly because Russian imports into the U.S. are banned but also because U.S. refining capacity has fallen over the past few years,” Andrew Hunter, Capital Economics senior economist, said.U.S. inventory stood at 106.2 million barrels of distillate, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, in the week ended Oct. 14, the Energy Information Administration said. That’s about 20% below the five-year average and equates to about a 26-day supply.Because diesel fuel is similar to heating oil, demand’s about to rise due to home heating this winter. “This is concerning,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis oil and refined products analyst at GasBuddy.com.“Between now and the end of November, if we don't build inventories, the wolf will be at the door,” Kloza said. “And it will look like a big ugly wolf if it’s a cold winter.”Story continuesIngrid Brown tops off her tanks with 92 gallons of diesel at a truck stop in Yuma, Arizona. She's headed east with a load of produceHow high could diesel prices climb?Diesel reached a record high of $5.816 per gallon in June, according to AAA, and Kloza said prices could challenge that in coming months or go even higher if winter’s colder than expected or Europe’s energy crisis “blows up.”It’s not just the U.S. seeing a supply crunch. The market is global, and global inventories are at the lowest since 1982 when the world had approximately 3.5 billion fewer people, Kloza noted.“There's a real threat something in the energy chain will go parabolic, and I think generally, the worry is that something that goes parabolic is diesel and heating oil,” he said, noting the time frame to watch closely is the dead of winter, from Dec. 15 to Feb. 15. Capping prices: G-7 nations move closer to price cap for Russian oil; US official says group eyes Putin's cash flowGassing action: Biden orders release of 15 million barrels from reserve aiming to reduce gas pricesWhat can consumers expect if diesel prices continue to rise?Soaring heating bills. Diesel isn’t as front and center as gasoline, but people “will be reacting to it soon,” Kloza said. “Those bills are in the mail.” He estimates some northeast home heating bills will run into the thousands of dollars. “I would buy sweaters,” he said.Already cold: More than 20 million Americans are behind on their utility billsGas prices edge up: Why gas prices are ticking back up and why that's a problem for Biden and the DemocratsBut De Haan says because diesel prices have been high for some time, consumers shouldn’t be too shocked.“Prices didn't shoot up overnight,” he said. “It’s been months, so it’s already hit grocery store shelves in the form of higher prices. I don't think there will be another jump, but prices will stay above normal.”Hunter also said he expects high diesel prices will be offset by lower prices in other areas of the supply chain. “Unless the current diesel shortage gets much worse, I wouldn’t expect that to be enough to outweigh the disinflationary impact of the significant easing of pressures we’re seeing elsewhere,"" such as in global shipping costs, easing labor and component shortages, he said.Can diesel prices be stopped?A big boost to inventories would help, but that’s unlikely, analysts say.“Globally, there’s not enough refining capacity,” De Haan said.There are ways to make diesel from soybeans and other renewables, but the primary way is to refine crude oil and it’ll be hard to stock distillate because of scheduled maintenance that temporarily shuts down refineries.Recession ahead: Economist explains why recession is likely unavoidable in the U.S.Delaying payment: More people are paying for groceries with buy now, pay later apps as inflation pinchesThe other option would be to lower demand, which might include shivering through the winter.

Investors were deeply unimpressed, sending Suisse stock tumbling more than 15% after an earnings report that also included big losses, and a fundraising plan that would massively dilute current shareholders.Elements of the plan seem significant not just for the struggling bank, but for the financial industry overall. Suisse wants to get much smaller, reducing headcount by roughly one-fifth. According to multiple reports, it wants to spin off some of its investment banking and advisory business to form a company called Credit Suisse First Boston – or, rather, to re-form it.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Credit Suisse’s dramatic flubs in recent years are dominating discussion of the new tack, and fair enough: The bank’s embarrassing losses on borderline frauds like Archegos and Greensill invite very pointed questions about whether the bank has the talent and discipline needed to handle high finance.But Suisse’s repeated self-inflicted wounds may also be the product of broader structural factors, maybe including the limits of the high finance market as a whole.Suisse was among the European banks that decided, starting mostly in the 1990s, to try to compete with Wall Street in corporate dealmaking. For both Suisse and the equally notorious Deutsche Bank, this strategic shift has arguably been a decades-long boondoggle.Deutsche beat its own retreat in 2019, proactively shrinking its investment banking operations after, quite simply, failing to make money at it. UBS did something similar way back in 2012, though under quite different conditions. Notably, UBS planned 10,000 layoffs in its investment banking pullback, very close to Credit Suisse’s planned 9,000 cuts.Story continuesFor Credit Suisse, the spin-off of First Boston would certainly represent a poetic admission of defeat. The relationship between Suisse and First Boston started in 1978, leading to a merger in 1988 and the retirement of the “Credit Suisse First Boston” brand in 2005.See also: Bitcoiners Were Right: Weaponized Finance Just Created a Post-Dollar Planet | OpinionBut despite that bold symbolic move, Credit Suisse never made sustained headway in taking finance business away from Wall Street titans including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Suisse’s market cap peaked in 2007. Despite being relatively well-positioned going into the global financial crisis, it basically failed to capitalize on the decade-long expansion that followed.Now, Suisse’s road map suggests a greater strategic focus on wealth management for rich individuals. That’s still a potentially lucrative market but it offers nothing like the opportunity of investment banking.When the pie stops growingOne way to interpret the recent retreats by Deutsche Bank and Suisse is that there simply isn’t enough demand for investment banking to support every entity that would love to be collecting investment banking-size fees. That’s not obvious from a high level because the sector has continued to grow, but a recent Deloitte report identified significant structural headwinds – including potential competition from blockchains and other lower-friction digital finance technologies.Really seeing the deeper limits of high finance, though, requires attention to the relationship between speculation and crisis. Entities like Suisse and Deutsche that try to “break in” to mergers advisory and the like will tend to engage in riskier deals, even at similar levels of competence, leading almost inevitably to blowups like those of hedge fund Archegos and financial services firm Greensill.What really boggles the mind, though, is thinking about how many near-misses this implies: deals that maybe should never have happened, but which expansion-hungry banks made anyway. Even if these edge deals didn’t make much money, they would have been counted toward “growth” in finance as long as they didn’t blow up quite as badly as an Archegos.Even more significantly, most mergers and other deals that earn fees for banks end up having neutral or negative impacts for shareholder value and in the real economy.See also: Why DeFi Might Be Safer Than Traditional Finance | OpinionPut differently, it seems likely that the growth in finance in recent decades was driven by the supply side – money looking for deals to do, rather than deals that actually needed to get done. Some of the itchiest suppliers are finally taking their chips and going home, which in this framing could have some stabilizing effect on the macroeconomy and mute the kind of boom-bust cycles that have begun to feel endemic.That might be wishful thinking – the world remains awash in capital seeking returns, so who’s to say if unproductive deals will actually be damped by the decline of a couple of spectacularly bumbling intermediaries? But given the increasingly extractive role of finance in world affairs, some may see it as a slim ray of hope.]"

Both benchmarks, however, ended the week up more than 3%.Beijing doubled down on its zero-Covid policy, extending lockdown to further cities across China as coronavirus cases topped 1,000 for the third day in a row.The increased lockdown measures from the world’s largest energy importer are expected to further stifle travel activity, fueling further worries about energy demand at a time when many are wary about the impact of a slowing global economy.Despite the muddied outlook on demand, investors are betting that the U.S.-led move to release emergency oil stockpiles isn’t likely to plug the supply gap amid OPEC and its allies’ plans to cut production sharply next month.Last week, President Biden said that the U.S. would release a further 15 million barrels of oil from the United States strategic reserve by December, to further drive down fuel prices. The move would fulfill the president's earlier plan - announced in March - to release a total of 180 million barrels.OPEC production survey data, slated to be released from Bloomberg and Reuters next week, is likely to show that output has fallen “marginally, in line with the OPEC+ decision, before it is reduced considerably more sharply in November,” Commerzbank said.As well as the OPEC+ cuts, supply will be held hostage by the geopolitical developments as European countries are closing in on a Dec. 5 deadline when sanctions barring the purchase of Russian crude are set to kick in.“[T]he oil market is likely to tighten as a result, especially since the EU’s oil embargo that will come into force in early December should likewise drive down the supply of oil from Russia,” Commerzbank added. “We therefore see Brent well supported at its current level of around $96 per barrel.”Story continuesRelated ArticlesOil Notches Weekly Gain Despite Slip as Bulls Feast on Supply-Shortage BetsCanada strengthening guidelines to protect critical minerals sectorsOil giants' massive profits revive calls for windfall taxes]"

Chevron's full-year output will be near the lower end of the 700,000 to 750,000 barrels of oil and gas per day (boed) it has targeted while Exxon lowered its forecast to a gain of 20% from last year from its earlier estimate of 25%.""Productivity came in a little less than we anticipated and we wanted to rectify that,"" Pioneer President Richard Dealy said of the changes during an investor call on Friday.The company's third-quarter oil production fell about 9% from a year earlier to 354,000 barrels per day (bpd).

Output is expected to grow by 50,000 bpd in November to 5.45 million bpd, the smallest monthly gain this year.Pioneer said its revised drilling should deliver well productivity - the volume of oil per well - to exceed 2021 levels.""We're really just reshuffling the portfolio and bringing forward higher return wells and deferring some of the wells"" that are not as productive, Dealy told analysts.(Reporting by Liz Hampton in Denver; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

For the third quarter, the Madison Dividend Income Fund (Class Y) declined -7.8%, compared to the S&amp;P 500 Index, Russell 1000 Value Index, and Lipper Equity Income peer group declines of -4.9%, -5.6%, -5.8%, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, the Fund declined -16.9%, which outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index and Russell 1000 Value Index returns of -23.9% and -17.8%, respectively, compared to the Lipper Equity Income peer group return of -16.0%. Try to spare some time to check the fund's top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Madison Dividend Income Fund mentioned Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1935, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a New York, New York-based multinational investment management and financial services company with a $136.3 billion market capitalization. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -22.19%. The stock closed at $80.51 per share on October 25, 2022.Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.1Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time...""

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings currently stands at 91 cents per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 5.8%.Q2 PerformanceSealed Air’s second-quarter 2022 earnings and sales increased year over year. While earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the same. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of around 7%, on average.Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSealed Air Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSealed Air Corporation price-eps-surprise | Sealed Air Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model IndicatesOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sealed Air this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: Sealed Air has an Earnings ESP of -1.46%. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Factors to NoteSealed Air’s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from elevated demand for packaging of food, beverage and healthcare products as well as surging e-commerce activities. Around 63% of the company’s revenues are generated from the packaging of protein, foods, fluids and goods for the medical and life-sciences industries, while e-commerce sales contribute nearly 11%.In December 2018, Sealed Air had set forth a reformation plan called Reinvent SEE Strategy along with a fresh restructuring program to boost growth and earnings. The strategy is focused on innovations, SG&amp;A productivity, product-cost efficiency, channel optimization and customer service enhancements. The capabilities, operational disciplines, and governance processes established through the Reinvent SEE business transformation are now embedded in the company’s ongoing productivity improvement system, SEE Operating Engine. Savings from these initiatives have been aiding the company in delivering sales growth and productivity gains and mitigating supply-chain related challenges. This is expected to have driven the operating margin performance in the September-ended quarter.However, SEE has been encountering supply chain disruptions, higher raw material costs as well as elevated freight costs associated with the sourcing and movement of raw materials due to overall tight market conditions. These factors are likely to have impacted its margin performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has been increasing its R&amp;D investments in innovation and automation, which might have weighed on its margins.Story continuesSegment EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Food segment’s third-quarter net sales is pegged at $851 million, suggesting growth of 7% from the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) stands at $180 million, indicating an increase of 7% from the year-ago quarter. The segment’s results are likely to reflect the ongoing recovery in food service demand and a strong need for automated equipment solutions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Protective Packaging segment’s third-quarter net sales is pegged at $636 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s adjusted EBITDA stands at $113 million, suggesting growth of 10% from the year-earlier reported figure. The segment’s medical and life sciences portfolio continues to gain from strong demand for medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment coupled with higher demand for temperature assurance packaging solutions.Sustained growth in e-commerce along with fulfillment and higher demand in the industrial-end markets might have favored the segment’s to-be-reported quarter’s performance.Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, shares of Sealed Air have declined 20.1% compared with the industry’s fall of 9.1%.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some Industrial Products stocks, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Sonoco Products Company SON currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.20% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

Some of that differentiation was clear from the stock market reaction to the results as well, with Amazon and Meta shares literally being taken to the woodshed following the releases.The one thing that is becoming clear after results from these ‘Big 5 Tech Players’ is that none of these their profitability is Teflon coated and immune from cyclical forces. Apple may be looking invincible today in the afterglow of its quarterly report, but the consumer decision to purchase the company’s pricey phones and other devices will also always remain a discretionary choice and vulnerable to economic forces.Q3 earnings for the ‘Big 5 Tech Players’ in the aggregate are down -15.2% from the same period last year on +9.4% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor 2022 as a whole, the group is expected to bring in -13.2% lower earnings on +6.1% higher revenues. But growth is expected to resume next year, as you can see in the chart below that shows the group’s earnings and revenue picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne possible explanation for this group’s growth challenge is the all-around margin pressures, a function of their bulging payrolls, particularly for Amazon, Meta and Alphabet. One could say that if they move into the management mode of other blue-chip operators by getting on top of their expenses, they can help strengthen their profitability.Story continuesAmazon hired a ton of workers during Covid to meet the surging demand as all of us stopped going to stores. The question now is whether they need to let some of those workers go as Covid restrictions are mostly in the rear-view mirror now.In addition to the group’s margin challenge, there are two key factors that will drive their profitability over the next two years.The first factor is the unusual impact of Covid on their profitability in the last two years. You can see some of that from the 2021 growth figures in the above chart. The chart below shows the aggregate dollar earnings for the group in the last 6 years and estimates for the next two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe have highlighted above the two years that benefited from the Covid effects. The question now is whether the +58% jump in 2021 earnings brought forward profits from 2022 only, or did it include 2023 as well?The second factor is related to the impact of macroeconomic forces on profitability. Microsoft’s business was affected not only by the slump in PC demand, a function of post-Covid adjustments, but also by growth deceleration in the cloud business. We saw similar cloud-centric challenges in the Amazon and Alphabet reports as well.This cloud deceleration is likely a reflection of companies cutting back on so-called enterprise spending, on top of digital advertising spending. The market was under the impression that cloud spending was effectively immune from economic forces and would not experience any cuts. The numbers from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet show otherwise.This brings us back to evaluating the seemingly Teflon-coated status of Apple’s gadgets and services.I am of the opinion that once the Fed’s tighter policy regime produces cracks in the labor market, we will end up discovering that consumers rationally defer replacing their older devices with newer ones. We are not there yet because the labor market is rock solid, but we could very well reach that stage in either of the coming two quarterly reports.    Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of the reports through Friday, October 28th, we now have Q3 results from 263 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 52.6% of the index’s total market capitalization.We have another super busy reporting docket this week, with results from more than 1,100 companies on deck, including results from 163 S&amp;P 500 members.For the 263 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are down –0.6% from the same period last year on +11.3% higher revenues, with 71.9% beating EPS estimates and 63.1% beating revenue estimates.Here is how the 2022 Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 263 companies compares across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere is how the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these 263 companies compare across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe EPS and revenue beats percentages were notably on the weak side earlier in the reporting cycle.

Part of the problem, says Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, is that analysts now need to mark down their earnings estimates for these companies to reflect the weakening economic fundamentals highlighted in the third-quarter reports. And as those estimates come down, the stocks’ valuations based on projected profits will bounce right back up.“Earnings estimates for tech look too high given elevated US inflation, declining corporate confidence and a tightening of financial conditions,” Haefele said.The Week That WasOne after another, tech giants delivered a roughly similar message this week: Sales are slowing from personal computers to digital advertising and e-commerce amid soaring interest rates and rampant inflation. Even growth in cloud computing, regarded as something close to recession-proof because the services can help businesses save money, is decelerating.The response from traders was to head for exits in droves, inflicting more pain on a critical group of stocks that over the course of the year have gone from perennial market leaders to pariahs and laying down another roadblock to a sustainable market rebound.Story continuesOptions trading in big tech stocks suggest that investors are back on the cautious side or even speculating that there’s more room to fall. The aggregated put volume for Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Netflix Inc., Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft has spiked from a low and is now back at levels last seen in May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Microsoft and Alphabet lost about $280 billion in combined market value on Wednesday, the day after delivering results. Meta Platforms shed a quarter of its value after plans to boost spending jolted investors amid its second-consecutive quarter of shrinking revenue. Meanwhile, Amazon’s worst forecast for holiday-quarter growth in its history sent the stock down as much as 12% on Friday, briefly pushing its market capitalizaton below $1 trillion.Apple’s ResilienceIt wasn’t until Apple, the last of the five biggest technology companies by sales to report, that investors were treated to some good news. The iPhone maker’s quarterly revenue exceeded Wall Street estimates thanks to brisk sales of Mac computers and wearables like watches. However, Apple warned that growth wouldn’t be as good in the current quarter.Apple’s relative strength in the wake of the other ugly earnings reports generated relief and sent the stock to a 7.6% gain on Friday, helping to lift the Nasdaq 100 Index and the S&amp;P 500 while adding about $150 billion to its market value.Market InfluenceMicrosoft, Amazon and Alphabet have all seen their shares fall more than 30% this year, compared with a roughly 18% decline for the S&amp;P 500. Apple, the only of the megacaps whose shares are living up to the notion that big tech’s massive scale and dominant market positions would insulate them from a market downturn, has fallen 12%.Big tech’s fall from grace has eroded its influence over the market-capitalization weighted S&amp;P 500 Index this year to the lowest since April 2020. Still, at 19% of the benchmark, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms hold bigger sway than the utilities, energy and consumer sectors combined.So far this week the carnage has done little to dampen enthusiasm on Wall Street this week amid optimism that the Federal Reserve is nearing a pause in its rate-hiking campaign with the economy weakening. The S&amp;P 500 rallied for a second-consecutive week with a 4% advance.Still, a gauge of the four original FANG stocks -- Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet -- is on track for its worst week ever relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index.Megacap tech stocks, the go-to place for investors to hide out during the pandemic, have been among the market’s biggest losers this year as the Federal Reserve embarked on its fastest tightening program in decades.“Not even tech giants are immune to that,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. “These earnings reports clearly show how inflation is catching up to consumer spending and how rate hikes are whipsawing the economy.”(Updates share moves and market values throughout.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYeezy Roller Coaster Ended With Two-Minute Phone Call at AdidasThese Five Women Are Helping Doctors Crack the Long-Covid MysteryFast Fashion Waste Is Choking Developing Countries With Mountains of TrashFed’s Inflation Fight Is Becoming a Battle Over Jobs, TooA Glimmer of Hope in the Quest for a Nonaddictive Painkiller©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The first order of business: ousting CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal.The moves marked an end to the tech industry's nightmare week, which saw giants from Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) to Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) take a wrecking ball to the teeth as each firm, one after another, reported slowing sales. Apple (AAPL) was the sole semi-winner, as its wearables and Mac businesses saved it from completely bumming out investors.Elon Musk's tweet reading ""The bird is freed"" is seen through a Twitter logo in this illustration taken October 28, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationThe week kicked off Tuesday with Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft releasing quarterly results that showed slowing growth in key business segments. Alphabet's earnings were objectively tougher to look at with the company missing Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line.But the biggest headlines included a $400 million miss on YouTube ad revenue, a slowdown in Google Cloud Platform revenue, and net income that came up $5 billion short of last year's numbers. Shares of the search giant were down 6% on the week.Microsoft, which also reported earnings on Tuesday, fared better than Google in the prior quarter. The company beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines, but its Intelligent Cloud segment growth fell year-over-year from 31% to 20%. It's all-important Azure cloud platform growth, meanwhile, fell from 50% to 35%. The company is still, in some watchers' eyes, set up to win long-term.“[Microsoft] is one of the strongest companies on the planet,"" Fitz-Gerald Group Principal Keith Fitz-Gerald told Yahoo Finance Live this week. “It’s one of the most widely held companies on the planet... Do you really want to get off a winning horse in the middle of the race? That’s what investors need to think.”Nevertheless, this week, Microsoft just didn't look all that great to investors, and it was the company's outlook for Azure that seemed to sting the worst, with the tech giant predicting that its Azure business growth will decline another 5% in the current quarter. Microsoft shares were off 3% for the week as of mid-day Friday.Story continuesPeople make their way past a Microsoft on October 26, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Leonardo Munoz/VIEWpress)Fellow cloud computing behemoth Amazon didn't fare much better, reporting misses on revenue and Amazon Web Services (AWS) sales. Those AWS sales are vital to the company and even the slight miss — $20.5 billion actual versus $21 billion expected — was a disappointment. However, the real drag on Amazon was its Q4 guidance. In anticipation of a muted holiday season, the company guided to between $140 billion and $144 billion instead of the expected $155 billion.Amazon's results were ""really macro-related — inflation, interest rates, energy costs, the Ukraine war are impacting the consumer,"" Cowen Managing Director John Blackledge told Yahoo Finance Live on Friday. ""They're also dealing with lingering spend issues, but they're working on it.""Amazon's shares are down about 15% as of mid-day Friday.In a rough time, Meta stands out as perhaps the week's biggest loser. The Facebook parent reported on Wednesday that its revenue declined in Q3 and missed analysts' expectations, as the company's pivot towards the metaverse increasingly generates criticism and scrutiny from watchers.Meta's stock went into free fall on Thursday, and its shares are still down 21% for the week as of mid-day Friday.Apple CEO Tim Cook poses for a selfie at the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14 range in New York City, September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew KellyThe one seeming bright spot for Big Tech this week came when Apple reported its Q4 earnings Thursday. While the company missed on revenue expectations for its iPhone and Services segments, it still managed to report record revenue for the quarter.But even Apple faltered. The company admitted that it will be stung by foreign exchange headwinds and that its Q4 growth will be lower than the 8% year-over-year growth it saw in Q3. Apple didn't provide exact guidance for its holiday quarter, but a drop during what is traditionally its best sales season could be damaging to the iPhone maker.So, Twitter might have been thrown a life raft with an anchor attached, but when looking at the rest of tech, it hasn't had the worst week.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Movado Group (MOV). MOV is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value grade of A.Another notable valuation metric for MOV is its P/B ratio of 1.56. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 4. MOV's P/B has been as high as 3.04 and as low as 1.33, with a median of 1.79, over the past year.Finally, investors should note that MOV has a P/CF ratio of 6.46. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. MOV's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 10.56. Over the past year, MOV's P/CF has been as high as 10.87 and as low as 5.53, with a median of 7.85.Another great Retail - Jewelry stock you could consider is Signet Jewelers (SIG), which is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Story continuesShares of Signet Jewelers currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 6.05, and its PEG ratio is 0.76. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 7.51 and 0.94.SIG's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.94 and as low as 4.15, with a median of 6.51. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.62, as low as 0.52, with a median of 0.81.Additionally, Signet Jewelers has a P/B ratio of 2.20 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 4. For SIG, this valuation metric has been as high as 3.77, as low as 1.79, with a median of 2.40 over the past year.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Movado Group and Signet Jewelers are likely being undervalued right now.

Shares have added about 2.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Paychex due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Paychex Beats On Q4 Earnings &amp; Revenues EstimatesPaychex reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results.Adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.5% and increased 12.5% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues of $1.15 billion beat the consensus mark by 2.9% and increased 11.2% year over year.Revenues in Detail    Revenues from Management Solutions increased 12% year over year to $845.3 million. The segment benefited from growth in the company’s payroll client bases and product penetration across human capital management (""HCM"") offerings resulting from strong sales performance and high levels of retention; high demand for HR Solutions; improved revenues per client resulting from higher employment levels within the company’s client base and enhanced price realization; and expansion of HCM ancillary services.Professional employer organization (“PEO”) and Insurance Solutions revenues were $284.3 million, up 10% from the year-ago quarter. The uptick was due to an increase in average worksite employees, a rise in average wages per worksite employee, higher revenues on state unemployment insurance and a rise in PEO health insurance revenues.Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% year over year to $14.7 million.Operating PerformanceAdjusted operating income increased 11% year over year to $394 million.Adjusted EBITDA of $445.2 million increased 11% year over year.Story continuesBalance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowPaychex exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $370 million compared with $267.5 million at the end of the prior quarter.

During the reported quarter, the company paid out $284.7 million in dividends.Fiscal 2023 ViewFor fiscal 2023, total revenues are expected to register 7-8% growth.

PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues are expected to grow 8-10%.The adjusted operating margin is expected to grow 40-41%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be nearly 44%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Paychex has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Archer Daniels Midland currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if ADM is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this agribusiness giant holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor ADM, shares are up 7.57% over the past week while the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry is up 0.69% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 16.77% compares favorably with the industry's 3.19% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Archer Daniels Midland have increased 14.77% over the past quarter, and have gained 45.17% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -4.86% and -14.92%, respectively.Investors should also take note of ADM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, ADM is averaging 2,695,480 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with ADM.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ADM's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.76 to $7.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that ADM is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Archer Daniels Midland on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Alaska Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group ALK, decided to exercise its option of purchasing 52 more 737 MAX jets from Boeing.More updates on airlines’ third-quarter earnings are available in the past-week’s write-up.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 JetBlue Airways’ third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of 21 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. Higher operating expenses hurt the bottom line. Strength in air-travel demand, however, helped JBLU reap a quarterly profit for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. In the year-ago quarter, JBLU incurred a loss of 12 cents per share. Operating revenues of $2,562 million climbed 29.9% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,559.7 million.

Southwest Airlines’ third-quarter 2022 earnings of 50 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. Moreover, the bottom line improved by more than 100% year over year. Revenues of $6,220 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,228.1 million but improved 32.9% year over year on the back of improvement in leisure demand and close-in bookings in September 2022. LUV’s top line also benefited from its loyalty program. However, LUV had to bear an unfavorable impact of nearly $18 million due to the flight disruptions caused by Hurricane Ian in late September 2022.LUV expects  the December-quarter revenues to increase in the 13-17% band from fourth-quarter 2019 levels.Story continues.3.  SkyWest reported third-quarter 2022 earnings of 96 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. In the year-ago quarter, SKYW reported earnings of $1.45 per share. The 33.8% year-over-year decline in earnings was due to the 2.6% rise in total costs. Revenues of $789.4 million, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $829.5 million. The top line increased 6% year over year, with block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) declining 12.6%.Revenues from flying agreements (contributing 96.7% to the top line) rose 6.2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Expenses pertaining to salary, wages and benefits increased 15.8% in the quarter.

Scheduled capacity (measured in available seat miles) increased 18.3% to 4,957,011 million.

While the company’s quarterly results are likely to exhibit year-over-year growth in revenues, funds from operations (FFO) per share might display a decline.In the last reported quarter, this Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 1.72% in terms of FFO per share. The quarterly results reflected healthy operating performance and growth in occupancy levels. The retail REIT behemoth also raised the 2022 FFO per share outlook based on the quarterly results.In the last four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average surprise being 9.39%. This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSimon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSimon Property Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPer a report from CBRE Group CBRE, retail metrics remained robust in the third quarter, given the onset of the holiday season. The core retail sales, excluding gasoline and automobiles, climbed 8.2% from the prior-year period. The non-store retail sales grew 13.8%, marking the highest growth since second-quarter 2021.The overall retail asking rent improved 2.5% year over year to a record high of $22.55 per square feet in the third quarter. The overall retail availability rate fell nearly a full percentage point year over year to 5%.Retail space absorption decreased more than half year over year to 14.3 million square feet in the third quarter, per the CBRE Group report. However, it was 8% higher than the figure in third-quarter 2019.The above-mentioned factors are likely to have played a key role in the third-quarter performance of retail REITs.  For Simon Property, which has wide exposure to different retail assets, including premium malls, lifestyle centers and other retail properties across the United States, an improving leasing environment and consumers’ increased preference for in-person shopping experience are expected to have aided its third-quarter cashflows.    Simon Property’s adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers are likely to have paid off well. Further, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, is anticipated to have enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.Also, the company’s solid balance-sheet position is likely to have supported its acquisition and development activities during the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter lease income is pegged at $1.214 billion, marginally up from $1.208 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for management fees and other revenues is $28.17 million, up 4.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. In addition, the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is presently pegged at $1.32 billion, indicating an increase of 1.7% year over year.However, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is still a concern for Simon Property. Also, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar might have been a deterrent.Simon Property’s activities during the third quarter were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been unchanged over the past month and currently stands at $2.93. Moreover, the figure reflects a fall of 6.4% year over year.Story continuesEarning WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for SPG this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: Simon Property has an Earnings ESP of +0.34%.

The sales figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $59 billion and increased 49.1% year over year.Chevron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseChevron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseChevron Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Chevron Corporation Quote Segment PerformanceUpstream: Chevron’s production of crude oil and natural gas — at 3,027 MBOE/d (56% liquids) — remained essentially flat year over year.The latest volume statistics reflect higher output from the Permian Basin and absence of weather-related disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico, offset by the end of the Erawan and Rokan concessions in Thailand and Indonesia, respectivelyThe U.S. output was up 4.3% year over year to 1,176 MBOE/d, though the company’s international operations (accounting for 61% of the total) fell 2.9% to 1,851 MBOE/d.Despite volumes remaining unchanged from last year, Chevron’s upstream segment recorded a profit of $9.3 billion in the third quarter of 2022, rocketing from the $5.1 billion earned in the year-ago period and also beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.2 billion.This was primarily on account of a significant improvement in commodity prices. At $76 per barrel, Chevron’s average realized liquids prices in the U.S. were 31% above the year-earlier levels while prices overseas rose 30.9%. On the natural gas front, its realizations soared 116.9% and 65%.Downstream: Chevron’s downstream segment recorded a profit of $2.5 billion, nearly doubling from last year’s figure of $1.3 billion and beating the consensus mark of $2.3 billion. The improvement underlined higher product sales margins and strong jet fuel demand following the continued easing of pandemic restrictions.Story continuesCash Flows, Capital ExpenditureThe company recorded $15.3 billion in cash flow from operations, compared to $8.6 billion a year ago. The soaring cash flow could be attributed to strong price realizations in the upstream business. Importantly, Chevron’s free cash flow for the quarter was $12.3 billion.Further, Chevron paid $2.7 billion in dividends and bought back $3.8 billion worth its shares.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company spent around $3.1 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter, compared to the year-ago period’s $2 billion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, the San Ramon, CA-based company had $15.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $23.6 billion with a debt-to-total capitalization of about 13%.Important Energy Releases So FarLet’s take a look at some key energy releases so far.Schlumberger SLB, the largest oilfield contractor, announced third-quarter earnings of 63 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. SLB recorded total revenues of $7.5 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.7%.Schlumberger’s strong quarterly earnings resulted from strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America. In more good news for investors, SLB generated a free cash flow of $1.1 billion during the period.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s capital expenditure came in at $382 million. As of Sep 30, 2022, SLB had approximately $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. It had long-term debt of $12.5 billion at the end of the third quarter.On the other hand, energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan KMI reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of 25 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents per share. The disappointing bottom line numbers could be blamed on lower pipeline volumes of gasoline and diesel fuel, partially offset by higher contributions from KMI’s natural gas pipelines and CO2 segments.As of Sep 30, 2022, Kinder Morgan reported $483 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company’s long-term debt amounted to $29 billion, resulting in a debt to capitalization of 49.6%. For 2022, KMI expects a dividend of $1.11 per share, suggesting an increase of 3% from the prior-year reported figure.Europe’s largest oil company Shell plc SHEL also reported underwhelming third-quarter earnings. The bottom line of $2.58 per share came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.68. The underperformance reflects lower production and a pullback in refining margins from their second-quarter highs. However, SHEL’s results were well above the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $1.06 per ADS, backed by stronger commodity prices.Meanwhile, Shell repurchased $5 billion of shares in the third quarter. The energy group also announced that it completed the $6 billion buyback program scheduled for the third quarter of 2022. Moreover, SHEL expects another $4 billion of repurchases for the fourth quarter and promised to increase its dividend by 15%.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

75,e6636376-6bd2-351b-925d-7b0424670f96,SLB,2022-10-29,Upbeat Earnings Boost Oil Services ETFs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upbeat-earnings-boost-oil-services-120012550.html,1666958412,STORY,"['HAL', 'SLB']","[Big oil services companies started releasing their quarterly numbers from this week. The outlook is bullish this time thanks to the upbeat oil market. OPEC+ producers agreed on deep output cuts, seeking to spur a recovery in crude prices despite repeated calls from U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration for the group to pump more to lower fuel prices and contain global inflation.Against this backdrop, a close monitoring of the energy space, which deals with oil field services, is warranted. Let’s delve a little deeper into the earnings picture and see how things are shaping up for the space.In this piece, we have considered two stocks, namely – Schlumberger SLB and Halliburton HAL.Schlumberger in Focus On Oct 20,Schlumberger Limited (SLB) has reported third-quarter 2022 earnings of 63 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. The bottom line significantly increased from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 36 cents.The oilfield service giant recorded total quarterly revenues of $7,477 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,143 million. The top line also improved from the year-ago quarter’s $5,847 million.Halliburton in FocusOn Oct 25,Halliburton Company (HAL) reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted net income per share of 60 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents and improving from the year-ago profit of 28 cents. The outperformance reflects stronger-than-expected profit from both its divisions and came in spite of the company’s exit from Russia.Revenues of $5.4 billion were 38.8% higher than the corresponding period of 2021 and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion. North American revenues rose 63.2% year over year to $2.6 billion, while revenues from Halliburton’s international operations were up 21.2% from the year-ago period to $2.7 billion. Investors should know that HAL has outsized exposure to the North American land drilling market.Story continuesMarket ImpactInvestors might want to know the impact of earnings results on ETFs that are heavily invested in these popular oil service companies. Below we highlight three oil-services ETFs with considerable allocation to SLB and HAL that could be in focus:VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF OIHOIH invests $2.79 billion of assets in 25 holdings and devotes as much as 22.45% of the portfolio weight to SLB, followed by 11.48% in HAL. Generally, when one stock accounts for as much as 20% of an ETF's weight, its individual performance decides much of the fund’s price movement. OIH gained 13.8% in the past five days (as of Oct 26, 2022).iShares US Oil Equipment &amp; Services ETF IEZThis ETF invests about $200.0 million of assets in about 26 securities, focusing solely on the energy world. The in-focus SLB takes up the first position here with 24.94% of holdings. HAL takes up the second position with about 21.28% of total assets. The fund added 14.7% in the past five days.Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLEXLE invests about $41.62 billion of assets in 23 stocks. The fund puts 5.11% of the portfolio weight in SLB. It added about 7.2% in the past five days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

76,fc062dbf-2afe-310e-bb79-0d0e52573fd7,AIG,2022-10-29,What to Expect From American International's (AIG) Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expect-american-internationals-aig-q3-173505124.html,1666978505,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group, Inc. AIG is set to report its third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 1, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the leading global insurance organization’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3% due to reduced alternative investment income. This was partially offset by higher net realized gains on the Fortitude Refunds withheld embedded derivative and solid underwriting results within the General Insurance segment.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of 73 cents has witnessed no movement in the past week. The estimated figure suggests a decrease of 24.7% from the prior-year reported number. AIG beat the consensus estimate in three of the prior four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 11.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican International Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican International Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of $11.5 billion indicates a 1.4% decrease from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate of $11.6 billion indicates a 0.9% year-over-year decrease.Factors to NoteImproved retention, new business and continued growth in the insurance premium rate are likely to have increased net premiums earned in General Insurance for the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned in General Insurance is pegged at $6,502 million, indicating an increase from $6,423 million in the year-ago period.Total premiums from Life and Retirement are expected to have increased due to improved pension risk transfer activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums from Life and Retirement is pegged at $1,105 million, indicating an increase from $1,041 million in the prior-year period. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $1,080.3 million, suggesting 3.8% growth.Story continuesHowever, profits from General Insurance are likely to have decreased due to increased losses and loss adjustment expenses, as well as a lower net investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted pre-tax income of $691 million for the third quarter indicates a decline from $811 million in the year-ago period, positioning the company for a year-over-year bottom-line fall. Our estimate suggests that the decline in General Insurance’s profits is expected to have reached 43.4% in the quarter under review, making an earnings beat uncertain.Further, the consensus mark for adjusted pre-tax income in Group Retirement, a part of Life and Retirement, is pegged at $231 million, down from $316 million a year ago. Our estimate of $285.1 million indicates a 9.8% year-over-year decline due to increased total benefits, losses and expenses.The consensus mark for adjusted pre-tax income for the overall Life and Retirement business is pegged at $884 million, signaling an increase from $877 million in the prior-year quarter. This is likely to have partially offset the negatives from the above-mentioned factors.Its transformative program, named AIG 200, is expected to have enabled the company to curb costs and expenses in the third quarter. This is likely to have provided the bottom line some breathing room in the quarter under review.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American International this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -18.62%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at 59 cents per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American International currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for American International, here are some companies in the broader Finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Atlas Corp. ATCO has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and a Zacks Rank of 1.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the Hologic share price has climbed 72% in five years, easily topping the market return of 41% (ignoring dividends).After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Hologic To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the five years of share price growth, Hologic moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Hologic has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.A Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Hologic returned a loss of 8.9% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 22%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Hologic , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Phillips 66 (PSX) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 28.4%, the stock of this oil refiner is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PSX meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 25.3% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PSX is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.36. This indicates that the stock moves 36% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that PSX has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PSX earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PSX is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PSX is currently trading at 0.33 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 33 cents for each dollar of sales.So, PSX appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to PSX, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) share price is up 58% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 44% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 37% , including dividends .The past week has proven to be lucrative for Amgen investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. See our latest analysis for Amgen There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 2.1% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Amgen, it has a TSR of 83% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Amgen has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 37% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Amgen better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Amgen .But note: Amgen may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks Jessica Akopyan, 805-447-0974 (media) Arvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors)Amgen Logo.

84,56d93547-6d12-349a-8cd5-ab6f24bb039a,NEM,2022-10-29,Top 10 Zinc Stocks Picked By Hedge Funds for 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-zinc-stocks-picked-132613586.html,1666963573,STORY,"['SCCO', 'CDE', 'TECK', 'NEM', 'HBM', 'EGO', 'HL-PB']","[In this article, we shall discuss the top 10 zinc stocks picked by hedge funds for 2022. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the zinc and precious metals industry in 2022, go directly and see Top 5 Zinc Stocks Picked By Hedge Funds for 2022.Zinc is one of the most valuable metals in the modern economy. The steel industry utilizes zinc to galvanize steel and insulate it from weather and corrosion. The metal is also used in the production of brass and bronze, as well as die-casting to make numerous metal products. Furthermore, zinc is also essential to increase crop yield and quality, and is an important nutrient for human development and disease prevention. Zinc prices have touched a thirteen-year high in 2022, which marks a stunning 90% surge off the bottom earlier in the year. The prices have primarily shot up due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which has disrupted global supply chain and have boosted commodity prices, causing inflation to skyrocket.Despite this, zinc does not garner much attention from investors. It is a tough segment of the precious metals industry because there are little to no primary zinc producers that trade on major exchanges. However, there is still considerable profit potential buried within the sector and with zinc currently on the rise, despite the macroeconomic pressures and geo-political turbulence, it could provide some relief to investors crushed by the impending recession.Demand For Zinc Driven By Demand For InfrastructureZinc prices have surged more than 92% since January 2016. According to a report by McKinsey, zinc demand is directly proportional to demand for infrastructure. As city populations continue to rise, there is an alarming need to expand urban infrastructure to tend to the rising demand. This is what Bill Williams, COO of Canada-based Zinc One Resources, had to say about the relevance of zinc within the expanding construction and infrastructural market:Story continues“The most important application for zinc is in galvanizing steel. The emerging markets will need to invest in infrastructure as they grow their economies. They will need zinc for that, but will have to compete with the new infrastructure needs of China, the US and India — who all have major infrastructure plans underway.”China is currently the world's largest producer of zinc at more than 6 million tonnes every year, which is thrice the amount of the world's second largest producer, Peru. China is also the global leader in infrastructure, dedicating more investment into the construction industry than the United States and Europe combined. In 2021, China invested more than $3.6 trillion in infrastructure, and that number is increasing exponentially every year. China's policy of urbanization is the primary driver of its economic growth, considering the fact that between 1990 and 2022, the proportion of China's urban population has jumped from 26% to 56%. In other emerging economies like India, Peru and Bangladesh, a similar proportionality between zinc consumption and infrastructure expansion can be seen.Photo by Russ Ward on UnsplashSome of the most prominent players in the zinc industry are Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK), Vedanta Resources Ltd. (NYSE:VEDL), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). However, in this article, we shall only be going through the top 10 zinc stocks picked by hedge funds for 2022.Our MethodologyFor this article, we looked at Insider Monkey's extensive database tracking 895 elite hedge funds as of Q2 2022. We then chose the top 10 zinc stocks most popular with the hedge funds. We ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds which held stakes in them, from lowest to highest. We also mentioned some of the most popular shareholders in the respective stocks.Top 10 Zinc Stocks Picked By Hedge Funds for 202210. Eldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 13Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Eldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO) is a Canadian mining company which primarily deals in gold. However, in addition to gold, the company also mines lead, silver, and zinc. The company posted excellent Q2 2022 production results, delivering a gold production of 113,500 ounces. Although the figures declined 2% from the preceding year, it is pertinent to note that this was largely due to a slow start to 2022 for the company's Kisladag gold deposit. Kisladag production is expected to return to normal in Q3 2022, well above the quarterly 30,000 ounce mark. Like Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK), Vedanta Resources Ltd. (NYSE:VEDL), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Eldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO) is one of the top zinc stocks picked by hedge funds in 2022. On October 19, Stifel analyst Ingrid Rico lowered the price target on Eldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO) to $12.38 from $13.11, maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst notes that the company has a market cap of $1.05 billion as of October 19, which is significantly less than the NPV of its two key assets, the Kisladag and Lamaque gold deposits. This awards the company an extremely low valuation of $5.80 as of October 19. Even after subtracting an estimated $320 million in corporate G&amp;A and using a conservative P/NAV multiple of 0.8, the analyst sees a fair value closer to $13 per share. Hence, there is a 100% upside to the stock, making it one of the best undervalued stocks in the industry currently.9. Coeur Mining Inc. (NYSE:CDE)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 14Based in Chicago, Illinois, Coeur Mining Inc. (NYSE:CDE) is an American mining company which specializes in mining different precious metals including silver, lead and zinc. As of the second quarter of 2022, investor interest around the stock declined, with 14 hedge funds long the stock in Q2 2022, as compared to 20 hedge funds in the preceding quarter. As of Q2 2022, D.E. Shaw is the largest shareholder in the company, owning more than 5.36 million shares worth $16.31 million.The Coeur Mining Inc. (NYSE:CDE) posted a total revenue of $204.12 million in Q2 2022, representing a 5% decrease year-over-year. In the second quarter of 2022, the Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) posted an EPS of -$0.05, trailing estimates of $0 by -$0.05. Despite this, the company delivered strong gold production growth, and with gold sales representing more than 70% of the company's revenues, Coeur's (NYSE:CDE) expansion remains on-track with regards to estimated schedule and cost.In a conference call on October 1, the company's CEO Mitch Krebs claimed:""Three of our four operating mines delivered strong production growth compared to the first quarter. Solid metal sales, coupled with some positive changes in working capital led to a strong rebound in quarterly operating cash flow as well. As we look toward the second half of the year, our operations remain on track to achieve our full year production guidance.""8. Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 16Based in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL) is a mining company which primarily focuses on gold and silver. It is the third largest global producer of lead and zinc. The company increased its zinc reserves in 2022 by more than 7%. In the second quarter of 2022, the company posted a total revenue of $191.24 million and beat EPS estimates of $0.02, posting earnings of $0.04 per share. Hedge fund sentiment around the stock took a hit, with 16 funds long the stock in Q2 2022, down from 20 in the preceding quarter.On October 19, Canaccord analyst Dalton Baretto upgraded Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $5, up from $4.75. The analyst attributed the upgrade to the company's recent string of robust operating performance as well as predicted growth from the Keno Hill initiative. The shares continue to trade at a significant premium to intermediate precious metal producer peers, which the analyst chalks up to Hecla's (NYSE:HL) significant retail following in the United States. Like Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK), Vedanta Resources Ltd. (NYSE:VEDL), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL) is one of the most prominent players in the zinc industry. 7. Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 17Based in Mexico City, Southern Copper Corp. (NYSE:SCCO) is a Mexican mining company which ranks among the world's largest miners of molybdenum, silver, and zinc. Investor interest around Southern Copper Corp. (NYSE:SCCO) increased in the second quarter of 2022, with 17 hedge funds having stakes worth $274.8 million in the company. This was up from 16 hedge funds which were long the stock in Q1 2022. Ken Fisher's fund is the largest shareholder in Southern Copper Corp. (NYSE:SCCO) as of Q2 2022, with a total stake value of $178.36 million.On September 19, Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba upgraded Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $55, up from $51, citing Southern's (NYSE:SCCO) cheap valuation for the upgrade. The analyst contends that there has been a resurgence of value within America's metals and mining sector, although there is still some residual uncertainty that remains. The analyst selectively upgraded many names in the industry, including prominent players like Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK), Vedanta Resources Ltd. (NYSE:VEDL), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). The upgrades reflect exposure to deep value and/or self-help stories, amid macroeconomic turbulence and question marks over a resurgence by China.6. Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 19Headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) is a diversified Canadian mining company which primarily focuses on the production of copper concentrate and zinc metal. In 2021, the company churned out 121,106 tonnes of zinc. On September 18, Credit Suisse analyst Fahad Tariq lowered the price target on Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) to $5.08 from $5.44, keeping an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst has predicted an increasing demand for copper in the next ten years, making the company an excellent investment choice for the next copper bull market. Company operations are substantially exposed to copper and so with macroeconomic pressures and higher inflation not posing any significant risk, the stock is ideal for the long-term investor. However, the analyst cautions that there is still probability that the near future might develop differently than expected.In the second quarter of 2022, Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) managed to maintain investor interest, with 19 hedge funds long the stock in both, Q1 and Q2 of 2022. Robert Richards' Heathbridge Capital Management is the largest stakeholder in Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM), owning 3.72 million shares worth $14.97 million. Furthermore, in Q2 2022, the company met estimates by posting earnings of $0.12 per share. Total revenue stood at $415.45 million in the second quarter of 2022.

Little did I know that less than a month later, I would live through an experience that would change the company, the state and the industry. I joined the State Government Affairs team as state energy policy manager and was going through the usual onboarding of a new hire - everything from the procedural (time entry, benefits, meeting everyone on the team), to the substantive (what are the key energy policy issues facing the state, how we advocate PSEG's important role with our external stakeholders). Then, the storm of a century came…Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), Friday, October 28, 2022, Press release pictureSuddenly, it felt like I was thrown into the deep end of the pool. At the time, it felt like I barely had a chance to learn where my office was or remember all my team member's names. Next thing I knew, I was sitting in a room every morning with then PSEG CEO Ralph Izzo and PSE&amp;G COO Ralph LaRossa.I was embedded in the lower levels of PSEG corporate headquarters, which we called ""the bunker,"" for two weeks and served as the liaison for my public affairs colleagues in the field. My role was to provide data that would be used to update public officials and to receive data from the community regarding key sites in need of restoration. To say I got a ""crash course"" in the energy industry would be an understatement.Recently, PSEG was honored with the Edison Award, in large part due to our work on Energy Strong. Sandy was an eye opener for us that our energy infrastructure had to not just be more reliable, but also more resilient. It was one of the first real times we had seen the impacts of extreme weather and was a primary driver for Energy Strong. Even at the time, we knew that it would not be a onetime event. Yes, Sandy was the storm of the century, but think about all the large storms we've had since.Working at PSEG through Sandy was the experience of a lifetime. As I think back 10 years, if there is one moment that captures this journey it is the following. During a briefing call with one of our public officials and senior management, I had the privilege to listen in on the discussion as the public affairs liaison. As we were waiting for the official to log in, Ralph LaRossa looked over at me. He remembered that I had just started at the company and said, ""One heckuva learning curve, huh?""Story continuesLearn more about PSEG hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)Website: http://www.pseg.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722889/Superstorm-Learning-Curve]"

An improvement in economic conditions after the pandemic has been generating fresh demand for utility services.Domestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulation of emissions, the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also urging the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels.The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Per the updated outlook of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have spurred demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.Per the latest Earnings Trends report, the utility sector’s third-quarter earnings are expected to decline 9.3%, while revenues are estimated to improve 3%.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

The Energy Information Administration reporting just last week that the country had only 25 days of reserves remaining. Now the Biden administration weighing options to avert a crisis, as we head towards the winter. For more, we're joined by OPIS Global Head of Energy Analysis, Tom Kloza. Tom, good to see you. By one metric, diesel levels lowest in 40 years. How concerned should we be?TOM KLOZA: Well, I think we're concerned. I'd be a lot more concerned if this were the end of November or the end of December because diesel fuel and heating oil are the same molecules, essentially. And it's used a lot in the Northeast, and it's used in Europe. So we've seen prices in the Northeast go up by about $1.20 a gallon this month alone. And that's for diesel and for heating oil. The rest of the country, maybe $0.50. And I would say that in a couple of weeks when you get PPI numbers, that's going to haunt the inflationary aspects of those numbers.SEANA SMITH: Tom, how long do you see supplies remaining tight, then-- throughout the winter, at least?TOM KLOZA: I think so. If we get a mild winter, it really alters the calculus. And we do have some time now. It's probably worthwhile that we see these-- the use of the word ""shortage,"" as opposed to tightness or whatever, because something does need to happen. The problem is December 5 is when the European Union essentially begins boycotting or banning Russian oil. And Russian crude oil and Russian diesel are pretty much necessary for Europe and most of the North Atlantic.So it's going to be very, very touch and go. I would submit that maybe in the next 40 days, we don't see much short selling in the market. And like all markets, it needs short selling. So we're going to be very, very high up there. And again, I think it's bad for inflation. Everything moves across the country by either vessels, which use diesel now in their mix, trains, and of course, trucks. And it's very expensive with $5.50 to $6 prices out there.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Tom, speaking of Europe, we all talked for weeks, if not months, about a coming energy crisis in Europe. And now European natural gas prices plummeting. They don't even know what to do with it because supplies are full. Is it too early to say coast is clear?TOM KLOZA: Yeah, I think it's way too early. Now, it does tell you what happens with these markets that make parabolic moves. I mean, natural gas went from the equivalent of, like, $100 a barrel to $500 a barrel at the end of August. And now it's back to about 1/3 of that.So the same thing could happen in the United States. We're going to see the refiners get back in gear in the next month. They've had a lot of maintenance in October. They're going to make more gasoline, but they're really going to try to make more diesel, jet fuel, and heating oil because they're making $60, $70, $80, $90, $100 a barrel. They're making their fourth quarter margins right now in the first month of that quarter.SEANA SMITH: So, Tom, when you take a look at Europe, it sounds like it's more of a sigh of relief, rather than the fact that maybe Europe policymakers should be complacent. I guess what should they be doing or could they be doing to make sure the situation doesn't get significantly worse throughout the winter?TOM KLOZA: I think they're doing everything they can do right now. I mean, an embargo or a boycott is going to be very, very uncertain. And we don't really know what's going to happen. I mean, we have a desperate despot in charge of Russia, and he could cut off some of the supplies that would ordinarily go to Europe or some other countries. So there's a lot of uncertainty. And I don't think you'll see much selling in the market between now and December 5.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, I'd be remiss, Tom, if I didn't ask you about the Twitter back and forth between Exxon and President Biden. Exxon CEO suggesting on Twitter that's exactly what they're doing in the form of returning profits to the American people in the form of their quarterly dividend. And the answer from President Biden was, can't believe I have to say this. Giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for American families. What's your take on this back and forth?TOM KLOZA: You know, my take on this is like, well, at my country club, we don't have any non-- under-- or unemployment. It's really tone deaf on the part of the Exxon CEO. I'm sorry. But giving money back to shareholders is not the equivalent of treating the people on the margins of society who are paying these prices for heating oil, diesel, kerosene, or whatever. He needs to speak to the people on Main Street, and not on Wall Street.SEANA SMITH: And Tom, to that point, taking a look at Main Street, we know Exxon just posted another record profit. But when you take a look at gas prices, they have come down quite a bit. Here we are today at 3.76. When you take a look out over the next couple of months to year end, are you confident we'll remain below 4 bucks a gallon?TOM KLOZA: Yeah, I think we're going to be OK on gasoline prices because companies like Exxon and all the refiners right now, they're going to be making so much money on the middle of the barrel, the diesel and the jet fuel, that they're going to make a lot of gasoline, probably more than they would intend to make.So I think we're OK. And in the months of December and January and even February, we use about 15% to 20% less gasoline than we use in the driving season. So the whole thing, again, is, in the next 90 days, we'll look not so much for a point of stasis, but the launch pad from which the prices go at the end of the first quarter to 2023 or in the spring.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Tom Kloza from OPIS, appreciate it. Enjoy the weekend, sir.TOM KLOZA: Thanks.]"

As a consumer services company with roots in power generation, safety is paramount. Whether we're in plants, offices, or remote workplaces, this value extends to psychological well-being too.""Everybody talks about safety as being physically safe but psychologically, you're allowed to feel how you want to feel and express yourself and your opinions. You know you can bring your whole self to your work and workplace situations.,"" said Tara McKee, Associate Account Executive.McKee is part of the LGBTQIA+ Business Resource Group (BRG), One Space.Diverse perspectives on a unified topicPsychological safety is not easy to define, but it's important to foster. As NRG strives to create the best environment for everyone, we had the opportunity to sit down with members of two BRGs, BELIEVE (Black Employees Leading in Inclusion, Excellence, Vision, and Education) and One Space to hear their thoughts on what psychological safety means to them.NRG Energy, Friday, October 28, 2022, Press release pictureCreating a safe workplace for allBRGs hold a space for people to have conversations and for individuals to be seen and heard. In addition to these affinity groups, NRG hosts events and offers emotional intelligence and unconscious bias trainings to strengthen psychological safety across the organization.""It's important for people to not have to hide who they are in order to be the most productive person at work,"" said Eric Blackwell, Senior Manager, Government Affairs and co-president of One Space.When employees can truly speak their minds in a productive way, it creates and unlocks value because you can look at a problem that you're trying to solve from a different perspective.Senior Risk Analyst, Bridgette Jackson says being a part of BELIEVE has been transformational.""I've been working for 25 years in different environments and the addition of BELIEVE has really enhanced my work life. I applaud the company for valuing diversity and BRGs because you're making a space for people to gather, to share their thoughts and their feelings, and to connect with others over shared experiences. And in turn, they feel valued and become a more productive employee.""Story continuesThe impact BRGs makeBRGs not only enhance the employee experience, they also drive business impact. Many employees have felt comfortable stepping forward and proposing new ideas for projects.The NRG HBCU Academic Excellence Scholarship ProgramBELIEVE members started an initiative to create a scholarship program for students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In July, 10 students received scholarships to pursue their studies in STEM, Marketing, Communication, Business, Finance, Accounting, or Law at Texas A&amp;M or Prairie View A&amp;M University.""Our inaugural scholarship event was very successful. We met some of the recipients in person and they were very appreciative of NRG helping to secure their future. It was a proud moment,"" Janice Mayers, Vendor Manager and BELIEVE member said.LGBTQIA+ employee benefitsA series of One Space discussions led to a larger effort surrounding employee benefits. One Space members not only shared current inclusive benefits for LGBTQIA+ employees but also ideas for how to evolve policies to best suit changing needs.""One Space hosted a presentation to talk about adoption and other things that impact the lives of the LGBTQIA+ community. There are adoption support services that the company provides that I don't think people know about,"" Blackwell explainedThought-provoking discussionsMembers of BRGs like BELIEVE and One Space shared that through hosting speakers and special events, they strive to promote education and empowerment for everyone.""We hope the discussions that we have are trickling outside of our group into different teams and communities that we're a part of,"" Jackson said.In the wake of the tragic events in Buffalo, NY and Uvalde, TX, BELIEVE hosted a listening forum to acknowledge and remember the lives senselessly taken. DE&amp;I expert, Dr. Tana M. Session also led a discussion open to anyone who wanted to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences related to these tragedies, and to those who wanted to learn and listen.During Pride month, One Space marched in Pride parades in Houston and other cities and hosted an educational event featuring Jason Collins. As the first NBA player and professional athlete in the United States to come out, he shared his story and spoke about the support he received from teammates and the NBA.""There are lessons from that like, ‘How can I be a better colleague to someone in the community?' There are ways to help individuals, whether you're part of the community or an ally. I think these shared experiences are creating a safe space and we will continue to do that through insightful conversations,"" Blackwell said.An ongoing pursuitPursuing psychological safety is an ongoing endeavor for Jennifer Brunelle, Vice President of Talent Acquisition and Diversity and her team.""I think every opportunity, every event, allows us to grow, to get one step closer to what that ‘psychological safety' means for us. At the end of the day, what an employee is going to remember is ‘Wow, somebody was there for me. Somebody heard me,'"" Brunelle said.Psychological safety will be the theme of our second annual Day of Understanding. This event is part of the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion and aims to build a culture of understanding. By creating a safe atmosphere for honest conversations, we strengthen trust and instill empathy among our colleagues.Learn more about NRG Energy hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from NRG Energy on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: NRG EnergyWebsite: http://www.nrg.com/sustainability/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: NRG EnergyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722819/Fostering-Psychological-Safety]"

CenterPoint Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.64%, on average.Factors to NoteThe majority of CNP’s service territories experienced warmer-than-normal temperature patterns during the July-September 2022 quarter. Such a weather pattern is expected to have boosted electricity demand among the company’s customers for cooling purposes. This in turn must have boosted its top-line performance in the third quarter.CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCenterPoint Energy, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCenterPoint Energy, Inc. price-eps-surprise | CenterPoint Energy, Inc. QuoteHowever, tornadoes along with hail storms affected some parts of CenterPoint Energy’s service territories, which may have disrupted this utility’s services in those areas. This is likely to have resulted in outages for its customers, which might have impacted revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNP’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.74 billion, suggesting a slip of 0.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The impact of severe weather conditions mentioned above might have damaged some of the utility’s properties, thereby pushing up its quarterly costs for restoration work. This, in turn, might have hurt earnings in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, a favorable rate recovery as well as a warmer-than-normal weather pattern is projected to have aided CNP’s Q3 bottom-line performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 31 cents per share, indicating a decline of 6.1% from the prior-year reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CenterPoint Energy this time.

This compares to earnings of $0.24 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 47.62%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this limited partnership for clean-energy projects would post earnings of $0.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.61, delivering a surprise of 770%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.NextEra Energy Partners , which belongs to the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry, posted revenues of $302 million for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.38%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $252 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.NextEra Energy Partners shares have lost about 12% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.1%.What's Next for NextEra Energy Partners?While NextEra Energy Partners has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for NextEra Energy Partners: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock.

Alina Kuptsova / pixabayMastercard Inc on Thursday pushed back against worries of a slowdown in consumer spending after a weaker-than-expected forecast for revenue growth for the last three months of the year overshadowed an upbeat quarter for the U.S. card firm.Shares slipped 1 percent after the company said it expects revenue to rise in “low double digits” at the lower end of its forecast range, while analysts were expecting a near 15 percent increase.“Consumer spending remains resilient in the face of macroeconomic headwinds and cross-border travel continues to recover,” Mastercard Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra said in a call with analysts.Investors have been watching out how consumers are coping with stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates and punishing stocks at the slightest indication of a weakness.The forecast was consistent with the company’s prior expectations, Mehra added.Mild inflation tends to benefit card issuers but the recent cycle of aggressive monetary tightening has weighed on discretionary spending.“Volume trends were generally in line, but 4Q outlook is a bit below expectations on revenue growth,” said KBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani, adding that consumer spending was shifting because of inflationary pressures.Strong travel demand bolstered Mastercard, like its peers American Express Co and Visa Inc, during the three months ended Sept. 30.Cross-border volumes, a measure of spending on cards beyond the country of its issue, were up 44 percent. That helped drive up gross dollar volumes, or the dollar value of all transactions processed on Mastercard’s platform, by 11 percent.Reported revenue jumped 15 percent to $5.8 billion, while profit rose 4 percent to $2.5 billion.Excluding one-time costs, the company earned $2.68 per share, beating estimate of $2.56, according to Refinitiv data.(Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Sriraj Kalluvila)Copyright (2022) Thomson Reuters.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this chipmaker have returned -0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has gained 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $3.15 per share, indicating a change of +23.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $12.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +46.8%. This estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.66 indicates a change of +1% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $11.38 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.9%. The $44.17 billion and $46.55 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +31.6% and +5.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $10.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.7%. EPS of $2.96 for the same period compares with $1.92 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.5%. The EPS surprise was +3.5%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

104,0d792f49-3b61-32df-9e0f-abd298acb85a,LMT,2022-10-29,Shareholders may not want to ignore the US$13m worth sales made by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) insiders this past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-may-not-want-ignore-110021106.html,1667041221,STORY,['LMT'],"[While Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) shareholders have had a good week with the stock up 6.7%, they shouldn't let their guards down. The fact that insiders chose to dispose of US$13m worth of stock in the past 12 months even though prices were relatively low could be indicative of some anticipated weakness.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Lockheed MartinThe Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$485). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was 100% of Frank St. John's holding.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Lockheed Martin shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Lockheed Martin better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Lockheed Martin Insiders Are Selling The StockWe've seen more insider selling than insider buying at Lockheed Martin recently. We note insider Gregory Ulmer cashed in US$2.9m worth of shares. On the other hand we note insider John Donovan bought US$251k worth of shares. Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that Lockheed Martin insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$80m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Lockheed Martin Tell Us?The stark truth for Lockheed Martin is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that Lockheed Martin is growing earnings. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Lockheed Martin and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

ABBV reported earnings of $3.66 per share for the third quarter of 2022, beating both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $3.56 and $3.57, respectively. The reported earnings also exceeded the guidance of $3.55-$3.59. Earnings rose 29.3% year over year.ABBV’s revenues of $14.81 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $14.92 billion and $14.98 billion, respectively. Sales rose 3.3% year over year on a reported basis and 5.4% on an operational basis. Sales were driven by immunology and neuroscience products, with key drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi and Venclexta contributing to the top line. This was partially offset by lower sales of Juvederm and Imbruvica.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at constant exchange rates (CER).Quarter in DetailIn immunology, AbbVie’s flagship drug Humira recorded a year-over-year sales rise of 3.9% to $5.56 billion on an operational basis. Sales in the United States climbed 7.4% to $4.96 billion, which more than offset the 16.8% decline in ex-U.S. market sales of $603 million. The drug’s sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for global Humira sales, which was pegged at $5.55 billion.Humira’s international sales were affected by the launch of several direct biosimilar drugs in Europe by other pharma companies, including Amgen AMGN, Sandoz and Biogen BIIB. Companies like Amgen, Sandoz and Biogen were the first to start commercializing a Humira-biosimilar in Europe in 2018. Amgen, Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, Sandoz and many other companies also received FDA approvals for a Humira-biosimilar but commercialization in the United States is expected to start after the loss of exclusivity for Humira in the United States next year.Net revenues recorded from Skyrizi sales in the third quarter were $1.40 billion, up 78.3% on an operational basis year over year. This significant rise in sales is due to label expansions to the drug to include new patient populations in the last few quarters. Skyrizi sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 billion.Story continuesDuring the quarter, Rinvoq registered sales of $695 million, up 59.3% year over year on an operational basis. Ex-U.S. sales of the drug more than doubled year over year during the quarter. However, the drug’s sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $726 million.Sales from the neuroscience portfolio increased 8.3% on an operational basis to $1.67 billion, driven by Botox Therapeutic and Vraylar and additional sales from the migraine drug Qulipta. Nonetheless, neuroscience sales figures missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $1.82 billion and $1.79 billion, respectively.While Botox Therapeutic sales rose 10% to $699 million, sales of Vraylar increased 20.2% to $554 million. Sales of AbbVie’s oral migraine drug Ubrelvy generated $160 million of revenues, down 1.2% on an operational basis year over year.The recently launched Qulipta generated $62 million in product revenues compared to $33 million in second-quarter 2022.AbbVie’s oncology/hematology (including Imbruvica and Venclexta) sales declined 9.9% on an operational basis to $1.65 billion in the quarter, as growth of Venclexta sales, was more than offset by lower U.S. sales of Imbruvica. The oncology/hematology sales missed both the Zacks Consensus and our estimates of $1.79 billion and $1.80 billion, respectively.Third-quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were $1.14 billion, down 17.4% year over year. AbbVie developed the drug in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. ABBV shares international profits earned from Imbruvica with J&amp;J.U.S. sales of J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica grossed $849 million, down 23.5% from the year-ago figure. Sales of the J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica declined amid rising competition from novel oral treatments in the United States. AbbVie’s share of profit from the international sales of the J&amp;J-partnered drug rose 7.6% to $286 million.ABBV’s leukemia drug Venclexta generated revenues of $515 million in the reported quarter, reflecting 11.3% year-over-year growth on an operational basis.AbbVie’s aesthetics portfolio sales were up 8.1% on an operational basis to $1.30 billion. The sales figure was lower than management’s expectations as U.S. sales of Juvederm and other aesthetic drugs offset growth in the sales of Botox Cosmetic. Sales of Botox Cosmetic rose 21.6% on an operational basis to $637 million, while Juvéderm’s sales grew 5.3% on an operational basis to $352 million.Juvederm sales were hurt by the impact of COVID in China and the suspension of AbbVie’s aesthetics business operations in Russia, a key market for fillers.Eye care portfolio sales declined 25.2% on an operational basis to $623 million. Sales of Restasis, a key drug in the portfolio, decreased 55.9% year over year to $142 million.Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses increased 14.8% to $3.09 billion, while adjusted R&amp;D expenses were $1.61 billion in the third quarter, down 1.5% year over year. The adjusted operating margin represented 53.4% of sales.2022 EPS Guidance NarrowedAbbVie narrowed down its EPS guidance for 2022 to include the unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&amp;D and milestone expenses incurred during the third quarter. ABBV has confirmed the mid-point of its full-year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range and narrowed down the same to $13.84-$13.88, from the previously provided guidance of $13.78-$13.98. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $13.89.Shares of AbbVie were down 3.8% in pre-market trading on Oct 28 following the mixed earnings announcement and the lowered EPS guidance. AbbVie’s shares have gained 13.4% so far this year compared to the industry’s 1.8% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc.

The FDA approved J&amp;J’s JNJ Tecvayli for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and AstraZeneca’s AZN combination of Imjudo and Imfinzi for a liver cancer indication. An FDA advisory committee backed GSK’s GSK daprodustat to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) but only for patients on dialysis.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMerck and Novartis’ Q3 Earnings: Merck’s third-quarter results were better than expected, as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. An ongoing recovery from the disruptions related to the pandemic and strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil, led to improved sales in the quarter. Sales of Keytruda, the largest product in Merck’s portfolio, rose 20% year over year. Sales of HPV vaccines — Gardasil and Gardasil 9 — rose 15% year over year. Merck also slightly upped its sales and earnings expectations for the year.Novartis’ third-quarter results were mixed. It missed estimates for earnings while beating the same for revenues. Sales in Innovative Medicines rose 4% at constant currency, driven by the strong growth of Entresto, Kesimpta, Cosentyx and Kisqali. Sales in the Sandoz division also rose 4%, driven by continued growth in biopharmaceuticals. The company maintained its guidance for sales and core operating income to grow in the mid-single-digit range in 2022 while increasing its guidance for Sandoz sales growth to low to mid-single digit from low single digit.FDA Approves J&amp;J’s Multiple Myeloma Drug, Tecvayli: J&amp;J announced that the FDA has granted accelerated approval to Tecvayli (teclistamab) as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Tecvayli’s approval was based on data from the phase I/II MajesTEC-1 study, which showed that treatment with teclistamab resulted in deep and durable responses. Tecvayli was approved in Europe in August.Story continuesFDA Nod to AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi/Imjudo Combo for Liver Cancer: The FDA approved AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi in combination with Imjudo (tremelimumab) for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. The approval for this novel dose and schedule of the combination of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, Imjudo and a PD-L1 inhibitor, Imfinzi, is based on positive data from the HIMALAYA phase III study. Data from this study showed that a single priming dose of Imjudo added to Imfinzi reduced the risk of death by 22% versus sorafenib.AstraZeneca’s phase III study, MESSINA, on Fasenra in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) failed to meet one of the two dual-primary endpoints. In the study, Fasenra demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in histological disease remission but did not show any change in dysphagia symptoms compared to placebo in patients with EoE aged 12 years or older. Fasenra is currently approved for severe eosinophilic asthma.AstraZeneca’s pipeline candidate, capivasertib, a potential first-in-class AKT inhibitor, combined with a breast cancer drug, Faslodex, significantly demonstrated a statistically significant and a clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus Faslodex in the CAPItello-291 phase III study in advanced HR-positive breast cancer. The study met both primary endpoints, improving PFS in the overall patient population and in a prespecified biomarker subgroup of patients whose tumors had qualifying alterations in the PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN genes.AstraZeneca’s another pipeline candidate, camizestrant, a next-generation oral SERD met the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS for both doses (75mg and 150mg ) versus Faslodex (500mg) in patients with advanced ER-positive breast cancer in the SERENA-2 phase II study.FDA Panel’s Mixed Opinion on GSK’s Daprodustat’s NDA: The FDA’s Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) gave a mixed opinion on the NDA seeking approval of GSK’s daprodustat for anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The panel voted 13-3 in favor of daprodustat’s treatment benefits outweighing the risks in adult dialysis patients with anemia of CKD. However, for adult non-dialysis patients with anemia of CKD, the committee voted 5-11 against the benefits outweighing the risks. The FDA is not bound by the Committee’s recommendation, though it usually follows its opinion. The FDA’s decision on daprodustat’s NDA is expected on Feb 1, 2023. Daprodustat is approved as Duvroq in Japan for the treatment of patients with anemia of CKD, while a regulatory application is also under review in Europe with a regulatory decision anticipated in the first half of 2023.GSK’s two-phase III studies, ContRAst-1 and ContRAst-2, evaluating otilimab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis met the primary endpoints of a statistically significant ACR20 response versus placebo at week 12. However, the third study in the ContRAst phase IIl program, ContRAst-3, failed to demonstrate statistical significance on the primary endpoint of ACR20 response versus placebo at week 12. All the studies were conducted in difficult-to-treat RA patients who had an inadequate response to or could not tolerate available treatments like methotrexate or conventional synthetic or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or JAK inhibitors. However, though the ContRAst-1 and ContRAst-2 studies met the primary endpoints, GSK believes the limited efficacy seen does not support a suitable benefit/risk profile for otilimab as a potential treatment for RA. GSK has thus decided not to file regulatory applications for otilimab.Merck’s Vaxneuvance Vaccine Gets Europe Approval in Kids: The European Commission approved the use of Merck’s pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine, Vaxneuvance in children six weeks to less than 18 years of age.  Vaxneuvance can now be given for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia and acute otitis media in kids of this age group. Vaxneuvance was approved for use in adults aged 18 years and older in Europe last December to protect against invasive pneumococcal disease.Vaxneuvance was approved in the United States for use in individuals aged six weeks and older in June 2022.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 5.6% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnHere’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAll stocks rose in the last five trading sessions, with Lilly rising the most (8.3%).In the past six months, Lilly has gained the highest (21.9%), while AstraZeneca declined the most (13.3%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here: JNJ Q3 Earnings Beat, RHHBY Sales Weak, LLY, ABBV Ink M&amp;A Deals)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for Pfizer, Lilly and GSK’s Q3 earnings releases and regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more of the best stocks in Vanguard's top ETF, go directly to 5 Best Vanguard Stocks to Buy Now.Founded by Jack Bogle in 1975, Vanguard is one of the world's largest investment management companies with assets under management of $8.1 trillion in 2022 according to Statista. Given it popularity, Vanguard has over 30 million investors as of 9/30/2022 and also 18,800 employees.As a private company, Vanguard has been one of the fastest growing asset managers in the last decade in terms of total assets. The company, in fact, had the designation of the fastest growing asset manager in the world for seven straight years up to 2018. While Vanguard had assets under management of $991.9 billion in 2005, the company had assets under management of $7.3 trillion in 2021 and $8.1 trillion in 2022 thanks to its strong growth.In terms of its offerings, Vanguard offers a broad selection of investments, retirement services, and also advice to investors and institutions alike. As of 9/30/22, Vanguard also offers 412 funds worldwide with arguably its most popular fund being the ETF, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI).The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) is an ETF that,""seeks to track the investment performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which represents approximately 100% of the investable U.S. stock market and includes large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The fund invests by sampling the index, meaning that it holds a broadly diversified collection of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key characteristics. These key characteristics include industry weightings and market capitalization, as well as certain financial measures such as price/earnings ratio and dividend yield.""According to the company, The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)'s total net assets were $1.1 trillion as of 9/30/22.Story continuesGiven the ETF's huge size, we consider the most popular stocks in the The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), 'Vanguard Stocks' for this article.Given its huge size, the ETF has economies of scale and lower expenses as a percentage of assets as a result. In terms of its expense ratio, The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) has an expense ratio of 0.03% versus the average expense ratio of similar funds of 0.79%.Given the growth in the U.S. economy in the last 10 years, The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) has also performed pretty well in the last decade.In the last 10 years, the ETF has averaged an annual return of 11.34% as of 9/30/22. Since its inception in 5/24/2001, the ETF has averaged an annual return of 7.27% as of 9/30/22.2022Due to the Federal Reserve having increased interest rates 5 times in 2022 alone, the major indexes have all fallen fairly substantially this year.As a result, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF's net asset value has fallen 19.69% as of 10/26/22. With more interest rate increases likely and a recession also potentially occurring by the end of 2023, the market faces more headwinds and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF could potentially fall further in the near term.Nevertheless, given how diversified the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF is and also given the ETF's stock selection and weighting criteria, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF is arguably one of the best investments for long term investors.In terms of individual stocks mentioned in this article, each stock is arguably riskier than the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF given they are less diversified. Given the uncertain times, it could be a good idea for investors to own a well diversified portfolio of many different stocks across many different sectors.In terms of stocks of unique companies in Vanguard's most popular ETF, here are 11 of the largest ones:Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor the 11 Best Vanguard Stocks to Buy Now, we selected the top 11 weighted stocks from the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)'s holdings as of 9/30/22. We excluded Alphabet Inc. Class A because Alphabet Inc. Class C already makes it to the top 11 as well.11 Best Vanguard Stocks to Buy Now11. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)% of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) as of 9/30: 0.85%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 104While higher interest rates have helped JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s consumer banking business to an extent, the banking giant nevertheless faces headwinds given its capital market and corporate business. With many big tech companies recently missing earnings substantially, corporations could potentially cut back on spending in the next year. As one of the strongest banks, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is nevertheless well positioned in the long term. With a weight of 0.85%, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) ranks #11 on our list of 11 Best Vanguard Stocks to Buy Now.Alongside Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a stock that Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) has substantial shares in as of the second quarter.10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)% of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) as of 9/30: 0.86%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) closed below $100 per share on Thursday after the company's third quarter missed expectations and the company also issued weak guidance for the fourth quarter. Competition from TikTok and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s substantial spending on the metaverse have been headwinds. Not helping matters is that Elon Musk is now officially in charge of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s competitor, Twitter. Nevertheless, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has substantial earnings power if Mark Zuckerberg focuses on his core business and keeps the company's market share in social media.9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)% of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) as of 9/30: 1.01%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Given that it gets most of its profits from oil and gas, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is arguably riskier than some other stocks on this list if oil and gas prices decline. In the long term, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) will also need to transition into a greener future if it wants to keep growing its profits. Although that might be pretty difficult, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has substantial capital for M&amp;A given its market cap of $440 billion. As of 9/30, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) also accounted for 1.01% of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI).8. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)% of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) as of 9/30: 1.19%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Unlike the S&amp;P 500 which has fallen 20.6% year to date, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares are actually up 0.72% as of 10/27. Despite macro pressures such as a strong U.S. dollar which makes Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s international earnings less in dollar terms, the company reported strong third quarter results with 8.2% organic sales growth. Adjusted EPS also exceeded the consensus by 2%. As of 9/30, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) accounted for 1.19% of the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI).7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)% of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) as of 9/30: 1.25%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Although the market is substantially lower this year, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) shares have only declined 3% year to date given rising interest rates have helped the company's large insurance business. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) has also benefited from other factors including strong second quarter results where operating profits rose 22% when excluding foreign exchange gains. In the long term, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) looks attractive given the company's competitive advantages and expected future U.S. economic growth.6. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH)% of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) as of 9/30: 1.31%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) stock is up 7.9% year to date and the stock is near an all time high as the health insurance giant continues to benefit from membership growth as well as value based arrangements. For Q3, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) reported EPS of $5.79 and revenue of $80.89 billion, versus the consensus of $5.42 and $80.5 billion. As a result of its strong businesses and history of growth, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) has a market cap of almost $500 billion as of 10/27 and its stock accounts for 1.31% of the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI).Like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also stocks that Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) has substantial shares in as of Q2 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Vanguard Stocks to Buy Now.Suggested articles:10 Biggest ETF Companies in USA12 Best Value Dividend Stocks To Buy15 Biggest Hedge Funds in USADisclosure: None. 11 Best Vanguard Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
113,906f4b93-d23a-35f6-b83c-6bf9d1a64da5,MDT,2022-10-29,Positive earnings growth hasn't been enough to get Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) shareholders a favorable return over the last year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-earnings-growth-hasnt-enough-110041118.html,1667041241,STORY,['MDT'],"[The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. For example, the Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) share price is down 28% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 21%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 20% in the last three years.On a more encouraging note the company has added US$4.7b to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the one-year loss for shareholders. See our latest analysis for Medtronic There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Even though the Medtronic share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's surprising to see the share price fall so much, despite the improved EPS. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.Revenue was pretty flat on last year, which isn't too bad. But the share price might be lower because the market expected a meaningful improvement, and got none.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Medtronic stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Medtronic the TSR over the last 1 year was -26%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 21% in the twelve months, Medtronic shareholders did even worse, losing 26% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 4% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Vaccine Stocks To Buy Now.One of the most defensive areas of the market is healthcare, and in 2022 when the markets are falling to new lows, healthcare is showing remarkable resilience and even signs of upside potential. On October 22, Carter Braxton Worth, a notable financial analyst and stock market strategist, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the strong price action that vaccine stocks are exhibiting and cemented his thesis on why he thinks some vaccine stocks are ""poised to break out"". Carter Worth noted that all sectors of the market, excluding energy, are down. However, within the sectors that are down, healthcare is down the least. Carter Worth analyzed the chart for the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLV) and its performance relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) and his analysis showed that healthcare is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 in 2022.  Carter Worth named some stocks that are ""at 52-week highs and poised to break out"". Among his mentions were Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). Carter Worth said that ""we know that healthcare is up more than the market in the sense that it is down less than the market"" and that the two stocks from his mentions ""are actually up"" and investors should ""buy them both"".The stock market is in distress in 2022. As of October 28, the S&amp;P 500 is down 19.3% for the year, the Nasdaq has lost 30.6% since the beginning of the year, and the Dow has tanked 10.7% year to date.

Excluding Veklury, product sales increased 11% year over year to $6.1 billion due to increased product sales related to HIV, cell therapy, hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) and Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy).HIV product sales increased 7% to $4.5 billion, driven by a favorable channel mix associated with government utilization leading to higher average realized price, as well as higher demand.  Sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $4.3 billion.Biktarvy sales increased 22% year over year to $2.8 billion due to higher demand and channel mix. Descovy (FTC  200mg/TAF 25mg) sales increased 16% to $500 million, primarily driven by channel mix and higher demand, partially offset by inventory dynamics.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Biktarvy and Descovy was $2.6 billion and $453 million, respectively, while our estimates were $2.6 billion and $427 million.Story continuesHCV product sales increased 22% to $524 million, primarily due to a favorable resolution of a prior year rebate claim in Europe and other favorable pricing dynamics in the United States, partially offset by fewer patient starts.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) product sales increased 7% to $264 million. Vemlidy (TAF 25mg) sales increased 10%.Cell Therapy product sales increased 79% to $398 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $396 million but were short of our estimate of $444 million.Yescarta sales increased 81% to $317 million, primarily driven by demand in relapsed or refractory (“R/R”) large B-cell lymphoma (“LBCL”) in the United States and Europe.

The FDA approved J&amp;J’s JNJ Tecvayli for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and AstraZeneca’s AZN combination of Imjudo and Imfinzi for a liver cancer indication. An FDA advisory committee backed GSK’s GSK daprodustat to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) but only for patients on dialysis.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMerck and Novartis’ Q3 Earnings: Merck’s third-quarter results were better than expected, as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. An ongoing recovery from the disruptions related to the pandemic and strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil, led to improved sales in the quarter. Sales of Keytruda, the largest product in Merck’s portfolio, rose 20% year over year. Sales of HPV vaccines — Gardasil and Gardasil 9 — rose 15% year over year. Merck also slightly upped its sales and earnings expectations for the year.Novartis’ third-quarter results were mixed. It missed estimates for earnings while beating the same for revenues. Sales in Innovative Medicines rose 4% at constant currency, driven by the strong growth of Entresto, Kesimpta, Cosentyx and Kisqali. Sales in the Sandoz division also rose 4%, driven by continued growth in biopharmaceuticals. The company maintained its guidance for sales and core operating income to grow in the mid-single-digit range in 2022 while increasing its guidance for Sandoz sales growth to low to mid-single digit from low single digit.FDA Approves J&amp;J’s Multiple Myeloma Drug, Tecvayli: J&amp;J announced that the FDA has granted accelerated approval to Tecvayli (teclistamab) as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Tecvayli’s approval was based on data from the phase I/II MajesTEC-1 study, which showed that treatment with teclistamab resulted in deep and durable responses. Tecvayli was approved in Europe in August.Story continuesFDA Nod to AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi/Imjudo Combo for Liver Cancer: The FDA approved AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi in combination with Imjudo (tremelimumab) for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. The approval for this novel dose and schedule of the combination of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, Imjudo and a PD-L1 inhibitor, Imfinzi, is based on positive data from the HIMALAYA phase III study. Data from this study showed that a single priming dose of Imjudo added to Imfinzi reduced the risk of death by 22% versus sorafenib.AstraZeneca’s phase III study, MESSINA, on Fasenra in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) failed to meet one of the two dual-primary endpoints. In the study, Fasenra demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in histological disease remission but did not show any change in dysphagia symptoms compared to placebo in patients with EoE aged 12 years or older. Fasenra is currently approved for severe eosinophilic asthma.AstraZeneca’s pipeline candidate, capivasertib, a potential first-in-class AKT inhibitor, combined with a breast cancer drug, Faslodex, significantly demonstrated a statistically significant and a clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus Faslodex in the CAPItello-291 phase III study in advanced HR-positive breast cancer. The study met both primary endpoints, improving PFS in the overall patient population and in a prespecified biomarker subgroup of patients whose tumors had qualifying alterations in the PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN genes.AstraZeneca’s another pipeline candidate, camizestrant, a next-generation oral SERD met the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS for both doses (75mg and 150mg ) versus Faslodex (500mg) in patients with advanced ER-positive breast cancer in the SERENA-2 phase II study.FDA Panel’s Mixed Opinion on GSK’s Daprodustat’s NDA: The FDA’s Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) gave a mixed opinion on the NDA seeking approval of GSK’s daprodustat for anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The panel voted 13-3 in favor of daprodustat’s treatment benefits outweighing the risks in adult dialysis patients with anemia of CKD. However, for adult non-dialysis patients with anemia of CKD, the committee voted 5-11 against the benefits outweighing the risks. The FDA is not bound by the Committee’s recommendation, though it usually follows its opinion. The FDA’s decision on daprodustat’s NDA is expected on Feb 1, 2023. Daprodustat is approved as Duvroq in Japan for the treatment of patients with anemia of CKD, while a regulatory application is also under review in Europe with a regulatory decision anticipated in the first half of 2023.GSK’s two-phase III studies, ContRAst-1 and ContRAst-2, evaluating otilimab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis met the primary endpoints of a statistically significant ACR20 response versus placebo at week 12. However, the third study in the ContRAst phase IIl program, ContRAst-3, failed to demonstrate statistical significance on the primary endpoint of ACR20 response versus placebo at week 12. All the studies were conducted in difficult-to-treat RA patients who had an inadequate response to or could not tolerate available treatments like methotrexate or conventional synthetic or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or JAK inhibitors. However, though the ContRAst-1 and ContRAst-2 studies met the primary endpoints, GSK believes the limited efficacy seen does not support a suitable benefit/risk profile for otilimab as a potential treatment for RA. GSK has thus decided not to file regulatory applications for otilimab.Merck’s Vaxneuvance Vaccine Gets Europe Approval in Kids: The European Commission approved the use of Merck’s pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine, Vaxneuvance in children six weeks to less than 18 years of age.  Vaxneuvance can now be given for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia and acute otitis media in kids of this age group.

119,ca134b1c-7ca8-3f84-8389-5c42df492e3a,MRK,2022-10-29,Moderna (MRNA) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-mrna-report-q3-earnings-154603224.html,1666971963,STORY,"['MRNA', 'MRK']","[Moderna MRNA will report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3, before market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 16.44%.Moderna’s shares have plunged 43.3% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 23.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s surprise history has been mixed, with earnings beating estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while missing the same once. The average surprise is 20.72%.Moderna, Inc. Price and Consensus Moderna, Inc. Price and ConsensusModerna, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Moderna, Inc. Quote Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to NoteFor the third quarter, Moderna’s sales are likely to have been driven by its mRNA-based COVID-19 monovalent and bivalent vaccine doses across the globe. As the impact of the pandemic continues to subside in the United States and the government is encouraging citizens to resume pre-pandemic activities, Moderna is focused on developing its non-COVID pipeline to reduce its dependence on a single target market for revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter product sales stands at $3.6 billion. This projected figure indicates a decline from second-quarter 2022 revenues of $4.5 billion.Earlier this August, Moderna received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA for its BA.4/.5 Omicron-targeting bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine, mRNA-1273.222, in adults. A regulatory filing seeking authorization for mRNA-1273.222 is already under review in Europe. During the quarter, Moderna also received authorization for the use of mRNA-1273.214, another bivalent vaccine targeting the BA.1 Omicron subvariant, in Australia, Canada and Europe.Management has already entered into new supply agreements or revised existing supply agreements with these countries to supply Moderna’s bivalent COVID vaccines. While Moderna has an agreement to supply up to 300 million doses of mRNA-1273.222 in exchange for a consideration of up to $1.74 billion, it has revised the supply terms with the European countries for supplying its bivalent vaccines.Story continuesModerna’s grant revenues in the third quarter are likely to have been driven by an award from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) under the agreement to develop its coronavirus vaccine programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for grant revenues is pegged at $80 million.Apart from its COVID-19 vaccine candidates, Moderna is developing more than 30 candidates in different stages of clinical studies, majorly mRNA-based products targeting different indications, including cancer.Moderna is also developing a few pipeline candidates in collaboration with partners like AstraZeneca and Merck MRK, which use its mRNA technology to develop therapies targeting different indications. The partners pay milestone payments to Moderna, which are reflected as collaboration revenues. These collaboration revenues vary every quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for collaboration revenues in the third quarter is pegged at $32.16 million.Earlier this month, partner Merck exercised an option under an existing collaboration agreement. Per the agreement, the companies will develop and commercialize Moderna’s personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) candidate, mRNA-4157/V940. In consideration for exercising the option, Merck will pay $250 million to Moderna. This payment will be made by Merck in third-quarter 2022 and included in its non-GAAP financial results. Per the terms of collaboration, the companies will share costs and profits equally.Moderna may also discuss the progress on the development of its three mRNA-based vaccines targeting cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. While these vaccine candidates are currently in late-stage development, we also expect the company to provide an update on its other pipeline candidates.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Moderna this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Moderna has an Earnings ESP of -17.91% as the Most Accurate Estimate of $2.48 per share is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.02.Zacks Rank: Moderna has a Zacks Rank #3, currently.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks worth considering from the healthcare space, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.Angion Biomedica ANGN has an Earnings ESP of +25.00% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The outperformance was owing to higher production, primarily in the United States and Canada.

WMB need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $3.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Williams shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Williams is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry that ranks in the Top 14% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 40 cents per share to 43 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Williams right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

For those living with a disability (visible or not), the number of spoons they must use for a given activity can vary greatly from day to day-for everything from getting out of bed to socializing-and those without a disability may not realize what a luxury it is to need fewer spoons for the same activities.This is a particularly relatable concept for Illumina employee Katie Ellis, an Australian certified genetic counselor and senior medical science liaison, who lives with a disability while navigating the workplace. Ellis and her colleague in the United Kingdom, Hollie Church, senior talent acquisition specialist, recently collaborated to establish regional disability employee resource groups (ERGs) within Illumina. Their efforts align with National Disability Employment Awareness Month, which celebrates the contributions of America's workers with disabilities past and present. This year's theme is ""Disability: Part of the Equity Equation.""Ellis and Church answered a few questions about how the new ERGs came to be, and their long-term goals for them.What has been your experience as part of the ""equity equation""? What motivated you to launch this group now?Katie Ellis: I was hesitant to share my own experience of living with a disability. However, I saw positive changes in my own daughter [who shares the same disability] when her condition was recognized and promoted. It removed barriers to her learning and full participation. I thought, what else could we accomplish [at Illumina] if I raise my hand to help bring awareness, or who else could we empower? It can be hard to speak up-you think, ""Maybe I won't get that promotion, or be sent on that business trip""-and as I was thinking about this idea of creating an ERG at Illumina [for the Asia Pacific and Americas regions], it turns out the timing was just right. My colleague Hollie happened to be pitching the same idea for the Europe/Middle East/Africa [EMEA] region, teaming with participants globally.Story continuesHollie Church: Our new group [in EMEA], called Embrace Your Uniqueness [Unique for short], aims to create a safe space to gather data, and educate ourselves and the business on how to best support individuals who fall under the disability and/or neurodiversity group. We as a company facilitate diagnoses-why stop there? We plan to collaborate with our ERGs, to lean on each other for support, resources, and experience.What are your other goals for these ERGs?Ellis: We are already unlocking the power of the genome-and we can unlock the power of our employees. We already have a culture and a leadership team that encourage diversity and provide support. The goal is to make our workplace even more equitable, so employees can thrive and feel more comfortable to be involved. It's open to anyone with a disability, visible or invisible, including carers and disability community allies. By starting within our workplace, we can contribute to a more inclusive world for our children.Church: We ask: Why is this important for companies like us? If we can create an environment for those affected to thrive, we will see an increase in productivity and innovation-and it's also aligned to our company mission.Ellis: We are demonstrating our commitment to improve everyone's ability to maximize their own potential and accessibility within the company. I always cite ""The Spoon Theory"": How do we help our employees keep as many spoons as they can for their physical and emotional well-being? As a group, we will host events to raise awareness, consider strategies to reduce barriers in the workplace, and we will honor our employees' anonymity if they prefer. And it's a forum to discuss questions such as ""Do managers feel equipped to lead teams and people with disabilities?""The ERGs are just one example of Illumina's efforts: This month, CEO Francis deSouza signed the Disability:IN CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion; Illumina has also been recognized as one of the Best Places to Work by that nonprofit's 2022 Disability Equality Index. Illumina earned this honor because of its commitment to ensure its employee benefits support individuals with disabilities; to enhance companywide communications with more inclusive channels and options; and to diversify its partnerships with suppliers, including businesses owned by people with disabilities.While Illumina has made inroads to create a more diverse and equitable workplace, there is more progress to be made. Through the work of Ellis, Church, and many others, we will continue to be one of the most inclusive companies on the planet.To learn how Illumina is deepening its impact on human health by serving as a champion for patients, our communities, our people, and the planet, click here.Illumina, Friday, October 28, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722887/Empowering-the-Disability-Community-at-Illumina]"

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Southern Southern Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Comptroller, Ann Daiss, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$506k worth of shares at a price of US$67.47 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$66.34. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in Southern didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Southern better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Southern Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Southern insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$167m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Southern Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Southern insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Southern insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Southern you should be aware of, and 2 of them are significant.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The fuel load process marks a historic and pivotal milestone toward startup and commercial operation of the first new nuclear units to be built in the U.S. in more than three decades.""The Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 nuclear units represent a critical, long-term investment in our state's energy future, and the milestone of loading fuel for Unit 3 demonstrates the steady and evident progress at the nuclear expansion site,"" said Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""We're making history here in Georgia and the U.S. as we approach bringing online the first new nuclear unit to be built in the country in over 30 years. These units are important to building the future of energy and will serve as clean, emission-free sources of energy for Georgians for the next 60 to 80 years.""The start of Unit 3 fuel load comes after Southern Nuclear received a historic 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in August which signified that the new unit has been constructed and will be operated in conformance with the Combined License and NRC regulations. During fuel load, nuclear technicians and operators from Westinghouse and Southern Nuclear are scheduled to safely transfer 157 fuel assemblies one-by-one from the Unit 3 spent fuel pool to the Unit 3 reactor core in the coming days.Fuel load.Startup testing will begin next and is designed to demonstrate the integrated operation of the primary coolant system and steam supply system at design temperature and pressure with fuel inside the reactor. Operators will also bring the plant from cold shutdown to initial criticality, synchronize the unit to the electric grid and systematically raise power to 100%. Vogtle Unit 3 is projected to enter service in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesSouthern Nuclear will operate the new unit on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, the two new units, which will be clean energy sources that produce zero air pollution, are expected to power more than 500,000 homes and businesses.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsCertain information contained in this release is forward-looking information based on current expectations and plans that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking information includes, among other things, statements concerning the projected in-service date for Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4. Georgia Power cautions that there are certain factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information that has been provided. The reader is cautioned not to put undue reliance on this forward-looking information, which is not a guarantee of future performance and is subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the control of Georgia Power; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such suggested results will be realized. The following factors, in addition to those discussed in Georgia Power's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and subsequent securities filings, could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations as suggested by such forward-looking information: the potential effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic; the ability to control costs and avoid cost and schedule overruns during the development, construction, and operation of facilities or other projects, including Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale, due to current and/or future challenges which include, but are not limited to, changes in labor costs, availability and productivity, challenges with management of contractors or vendors, subcontractor performance, adverse weather conditions, shortages, delays, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor, contractor or supplier delay, delays due to judicial or regulatory action, nonperformance under construction, operating, or other agreements, operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs, engineering or design problems or any remediation related thereto, design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including inspections and the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria documentation for Plant Vogtle Unit 4 and the related investigations, reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel for Plant Vogtle Unit 4, challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure, or system integration, and/or operational performance, and challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic; the ability to overcome or mitigate the current challenges at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 that could further impact the cost and schedule for the project; legal proceedings and regulatory approvals and actions related to construction projects, such as Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including Public Service Commission approvals and NRC actions; under certain specified circumstances, a decision by holders of more than 10% of the ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 not to proceed with construction and the ability of certain other Vogtle owners to tender a portion of their ownership interests to Georgia Power following certain construction cost increases, including the purported exercise by Oglethorpe Power Corporation and the City of Dalton of their tender options and related litigation; the ability to construct facilities in accordance with the requirements of permits and licenses (including satisfaction of NRC requirements), to satisfy any environmental performance standards and the requirements of tax credits and other incentives, and to integrate facilities into the Southern Company system upon completion of construction; the inherent risks involved in operating and constructing nuclear generating facilities; the ability of counterparties of Georgia Power to make payments as and when due and to perform as required; the direct or indirect effect on Georgia Power's business resulting from cyber intrusion or physical attack and the threat of physical attacks; catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and other storms, droughts, pandemic health events, political unrest, wars or other similar occurrences; and the direct or indirect effects on Georgia Power's business resulting from incidents affecting the U.S. electric grid or operation of generating or storage resources.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Embraer and Northrop Grumman are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This means that ERJ's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.ERJ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.83, while NOC has a forward P/E of 21.65. We also note that ERJ has a PEG ratio of 1.05. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NOC currently has a PEG ratio of 9.89.Another notable valuation metric for ERJ is its P/B ratio of 0.62. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NOC has a P/B of 5.94.These metrics, and several others, help ERJ earn a Value grade of A, while NOC has been given a Value grade of D.ERJ sticks out from NOC in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ERJ is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For the quarter, the RiverPark Large Growth Fund (the “Fund”) lost 3.3% - a bit better than the S&amp;P 500 (-4.9% for the quarter) and about in line with the Russell 1000 Growth index (-3.6% for the quarter). Try to spare some time to check the fund's top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Leaven Partners mentioned NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1964, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is a Beaverton, Oregon-based footwear manufacturing company with a $143.5 billion market capitalization. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) delivered a -44.97% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -44.00%. The stock closed at $91.72 per share on October 25, 2022.Here is what Leaven Partners has to say about NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.""Story continuesnike, store, symbol, logo, clothing, popular, mall, nobody, retail, outlet, corporate, clothes, day, architectural, consumerism, commercial, beijing, outside, chain, fashion,TonyV3112 / Shutterstock.comOur calculations show that NIKE, Inc.

The grant was awarded to a new collaborative led by Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) NY, in partnership with the Center for NYC Neighborhoods and Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City (NHSNYC).The donation comes from Wells Fargo's Wealth Opportunity Restored Through Homeownership (WORTH) initiative, a $60 million national effort to address systemic barriers to homeownership for people of color. New York City is one of eight markets across the U.S. to receive a WORTH grant, which aims to help create 5,000 new homeowners of color across the city by the end of 2025.Today's announcement took place during NHSNYC's Homeownership Expo at the TWU Counseling Center, where participants learned about the homeownership process, how to find and secure mortgages, and how to navigate down payments and closing costs.""As a company, we're committed to creating opportunities for more people of color to buy their own homes,"" said Otis Rolley, president of the Wells Fargo Foundation and head of Philanthropy and Community Impact.

On October 22, Carter Braxton Worth, a notable financial analyst and stock market strategist, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the strong price action that vaccine stocks are exhibiting and cemented his thesis on why he thinks some vaccine stocks are ""poised to break out"". Carter Worth noted that all sectors of the market, excluding energy, are down. However, within the sectors that are down, healthcare is down the least. Carter Worth analyzed the chart for the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLV) and its performance relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) and his analysis showed that healthcare is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 in 2022.  Carter Worth named some stocks that are ""at 52-week highs and poised to break out"". Among his mentions were Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). Carter Worth said that ""we know that healthcare is up more than the market in the sense that it is down less than the market"" and that the two stocks from his mentions ""are actually up"" and investors should ""buy them both"".The stock market is in distress in 2022. As of October 28, the S&amp;P 500 is down 19.3% for the year, the Nasdaq has lost 30.6% since the beginning of the year, and the Dow has tanked 10.7% year to date.

This compares to earnings of $3.33 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.81%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drugmaker would post earnings of $3.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.37, delivering a surprise of 1.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.AbbVie , which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, posted revenues of $14.81 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.74%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $14.34 billion. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.AbbVie shares have added about 13.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.1%.What's Next for AbbVie?While AbbVie has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for AbbVie: mixed.

157,774a363e-9a17-37ae-8c65-9bba875f86bd,FOXA,2022-10-29,FuboTV Inc. (FUBO) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fubotv-inc-fubo-expected-beat-140002097.html,1666965602,STORY,"['FUBO', 'FOXA']","[FuboTV Inc. (FUBO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -25.4%.Revenues are expected to be $211.47 million, up 35% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.42% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for fuboTV Inc.For fuboTV Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.70%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that fuboTV Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that fuboTV Inc. Would post a loss of $0.69 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.63, delivering a surprise of +8.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.FuboTV Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, Fox (FOXA) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.2 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Fox has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.87%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fox will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Walt Disney Company (DIS), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL).

The Zacks analyst believes that Disney+’s profitability in recent times was negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney’s leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.However, the company continues to benefit from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. Availability in the Nordics, Latin America and other Asian territories is helping it expand its user base.

The Zacks analyst believes that increasing competition, along with high debt levels, are persistent overhangs. But Broadcom did report impressive third-quarter fiscal 2022 results. Top-line growth was driven by strength in cloud and service provider segments. Networking is riding on strong adoption of Broadcom’s next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers. Aggressive adoption of its next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth.Story continuesBroadcom expects fiscal fourth-quarter networking and server storage revenues to grow 30% and 45% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. An upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 guidance is encouraging. The VMware acquisition will aid prospects over the long term.(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of PayPal have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past three-month period (+0.9% vs. -16.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that PayPal is benefiting from growing total payments volume owing to increasing net new active accounts. Strengthening customer engagement on the company’s platform is a major positive. Further, Venmo’s improving monetization efforts and rising adoption rate across various platforms are aiding the total active accounts growth.However, intensifying competition in the digital payment market poses a serious risk to the company’s market position. Also, foreign exchange headwinds remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on PayPal here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO), and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC).Sheraz MianDirector of ResearchNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Increased margins and net interest revenues on rising interest rates will likely support top-line growth.Valero (VLO) Gains On Higher Gulf Coast Refinery ThroughputThe Zacks analyst is impressed by Valero's Gulf Coast refineries, contributing the most to its total throughput volumes. Higher Gulf Coast export volumes will also support its margins.Expanding Solar Market to Boost Enphase Energy (ENPH) GrowthPer the Zacks analyst, the expanding solar market that has set the stage for the solar microinverter market's boom tends to benefit Enphase as it remains a leading U.S. manufacturer of microinverters.New DowngradesMasco (MAS) Ails From Lower Demand, Higher Operational CostsPer the Zacks analyst, Masco is witnessing low demand and foreign currency headwinds.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, F5 Networks has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Paypal has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FFIV is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.FFIV currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.11, while PYPL has a forward P/E of 22.22. We also note that FFIV has a PEG ratio of 1.14. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PYPL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.39.Another notable valuation metric for FFIV is its P/B ratio of 3.37.

(PYPL) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-paypal-holdings-inc-130001168.html,1666962001,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -14.6%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 indicates a change of +20.7% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Paypal, the consensus sales estimate of $6.82 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.3%. The $27.85 billion and $31.27 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.8% and +12.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.1%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.15 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.71%. The EPS surprise was +9.41%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

165,88aefbb7-689c-303a-8874-3afbfd5db691,MPC,2022-10-29,Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-corporation-mpc-hits-131501092.html,1666962901,STORY,['MPC'],"[Have you been paying attention to shares of Marathon Petroleum (MPC)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 15.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $115.72 in the previous session. Marathon Petroleum has gained 77.6% since the start of the year compared to the 38.9% move for the Zacks Oils-Energy sector and the 38.3% return for the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 2, 2022, Marathon Petroleum reported EPS of $10.61 versus consensus estimate of $9.17 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 63.08%.For the current fiscal year, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $23.41 per share on $163.14 billion in revenues. This represents an 855.51% change in EPS on a 34.91% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $13.18 per share on $134.81 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -43.72% and -17.37%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMarathon Petroleum may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Marathon Petroleum has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 4.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14X versus its peer group's average of 10.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.21. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Marathon Petroleum passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Marathon Petroleum shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does MPC Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of MPC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Delek US Holdings, Inc. (DK). DK has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of F.Earnings were strong last quarter. Delek US Holdings, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 43.32%, and for the current fiscal year, DK is expected to post earnings of $6.55 per share on revenue of $18.52 billion.Shares of Delek US Holdings, Inc. have gained 9.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 4.52X and a P/CF of 56.1X.The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is in the top 5% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MPC and DK, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $6.80 per share on revenues of $35.7 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the independent oil refiner and marketer’s results in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at MPC’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last-reported quarter, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator handily beat the consensus mark on stronger-than-expected performance of its Refining &amp; Marketing segment, whose operating income totaled $7.1 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 108.4%. MPC had reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.61, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.17. Revenues of $54.2 billion generated by the firm also came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 63.1%.Marathon Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 56.7%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-eps-surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates an 831.5% surge year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 9.4% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderMPC is expected to have benefited from the strength in refining margins. In the second quarter of 2022, the company’s refining margin of $37.54 per barrel rocketed from $12.45 a year ago. Moreover, throughput rose from 2,854 thousand barrels per day (mbpd) in the second quarter of 2021 to 3,069 mbpd.Despite softening from the spectacular highs of the June quarter, the overall positive momentum is most likely to have continued in the third quarter, thanks to the strength in fuel demand on the back of rebounding road and airline travel, which pushed up crude differentials and margins.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marathon Petroleum’s Refining &amp; Marketing segment operating income is pegged at $3.6 billion, increasing exponentially from the prior-year quarter’s profit of just $509 million. This is likely to have buoyed the second-quarter results of Marathon Petroleum.On a somewhat bearish note, a higher expense structure might have dampened some of the positive impact. Marathon Petroleum’s total operating cost in the second quarter increased some 59.1% year over year to $45.9 billion. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the July-September period due to inflationary pressure and a planned turnaround budget.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Marathon Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $6.80 per share each.Zacks Rank: MPC currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this earnings season.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Petroleum, here are some firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:The Williams Companies WMB has an Earnings ESP of +1.53% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is scheduled to release earnings on Oct 31.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For 2022, Williams has a projected earnings growth rate of 13.2%.

The firm is scheduled to release earnings on Nov 1.Chesapeake Energy topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 24.5% in the trailing four quarters, including a 30.2% beat in Q2.

167,c0b0b037-2c33-31a6-9a31-b60e1bdd0366,AES,2022-10-29,Earnings Preview: Duke Energy (DUK) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-duke-energy-duk-140002859.html,1666965602,STORY,"['DUK', 'AESC']","[The market expects Duke Energy (DUK) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.7%.Revenues are expected to be $7.19 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.14% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Duke Energy?For Duke Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.64%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Duke Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Duke Energy would post earnings of $1.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.14, delivering a surprise of +3.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Duke Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, AES (AES) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.54 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.11 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for AES has been revised 6.4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 3.42%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that AES will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

172,4faa722d-51d9-326c-89fb-6fb991cd188a,GM,2022-10-29,UPDATE 1-Chrysler parent Stellantis offering U.S. salaried buyouts,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-chrysler-parent-stellantis-offering-164023577.html,1666975223,STORY,"['F', 'GM']","[(Adds Ford action, GM comment this week)By David ShepardsonOct 28 (Reuters) - Chrysler parent company Stellantis NV said Friday it has offered voluntary buyouts to some of its 13,000 U.S. salaried employees.Salaried workers age 55 or older who have been with the automaker at least 10 years are eligible.The world's No.4 carmaker, created early last year from the merger of PSA and Fiat Chrysler, said the offer was ""part of our transformation to become a sustainable tech mobility company and the market leader in low-emission vehicles."" The deadline to seek a buyout is Dec. 5.Stellantis plans to have 75 EV models on the market and sell five million EVs a year by 2030, including 50% of U.S. sales by then as EVs or plug-in hybrids. Ford Motor Co said in August it was cutting a total of 3,000 salaried and contract jobs, mostly in North America and India, telling workers that the company's cost structure ""is uncompetitive versus traditional and new competitors.""Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley had said he thought the No. 2 U.S. automker had too many people, and that not enough of its workforce had the skills required as the auto industry shifts to electric vehicles and digital services.Rival General Motors Co in late 2018 moved to cut 14,000 jobs as it prepared to accelerate its electric vehicle strategy but said this week it has no plans for layoffs.Earlier this year the Detroit automaker said it was slowing hiring and only replacing key departures or critical needs.GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said Tuesday he was ""proud of the way that the team is handling that and no plans for any layoffs at this point.""

CenterPoint Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.64%, on average.Factors to NoteThe majority of CNP’s service territories experienced warmer-than-normal temperature patterns during the July-September 2022 quarter. Such a weather pattern is expected to have boosted electricity demand among the company’s customers for cooling purposes. This in turn must have boosted its top-line performance in the third quarter.CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCenterPoint Energy, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCenterPoint Energy, Inc. price-eps-surprise | CenterPoint Energy, Inc. QuoteHowever, tornadoes along with hail storms affected some parts of CenterPoint Energy’s service territories, which may have disrupted this utility’s services in those areas. This is likely to have resulted in outages for its customers, which might have impacted revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNP’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.74 billion, suggesting a slip of 0.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The impact of severe weather conditions mentioned above might have damaged some of the utility’s properties, thereby pushing up its quarterly costs for restoration work. This, in turn, might have hurt earnings in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, a favorable rate recovery as well as a warmer-than-normal weather pattern is projected to have aided CNP’s Q3 bottom-line performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 31 cents per share, indicating a decline of 6.1% from the prior-year reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CenterPoint Energy this time.

175,ed68c126-6058-3e9d-80bd-1ee6d4d4b364,PNW,2022-10-29,Earnings Preview: Dominion Energy (D) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-dominion-energy-d-140002818.html,1666965602,STORY,"['D', 'PNW']","[Dominion Energy (D) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 4, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.7%.Revenues are expected to be $3.91 billion, up 23.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.21% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dominion Energy?For Dominion Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.23%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dominion Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Dominion Energy would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.77, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Dominion Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Pinnacle West (PNW) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.62 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -12.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.32 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Pinnacle West has been revised 228.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.66%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Pinnacle West will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

178,5e48f718-b9f5-3a0d-86f1-b4b45abb7d10,TGT,2022-10-29,20 Biggest Companies in the World by Employees,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-companies-world-employees-162532572.html,1666974332,STORY,"['HD', 'TGT', 'KR']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 biggest companies in the world by the number of employees. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest companies in the world by employees.Most companies judge themselves, and are judged by the general public, based on their revenues, market cap, profits, dividends and returns to shareholders. Their biggest concerns are how to maximize returns by maximizing profits, or adapting to everchanging economic situations in a volatile decade, such as the pandemic or now the threat of a looming recession. In the search for higher revenues and lower costs, the latter of which has become even more important now that inflation is increasing and margins are decreasing due to rising costs, many companies often lose sight of what makes them tick in the first place; their employees.The trends of employment have changed over time. In previous decades, many employees would stay at one company their entire life, and loyalty to the company was considered to be important as well. Now, job switching is all the rage and in fact, in many cases, a necessity to both increase your pay and climbing up the corporate ladder. There are tons of articles on every corporate website or magazine on whether switching jobs is good or not, and while it may come down to individual circumstances, companies no longer frown upon those switching jobs after every couple of years to further their career.We are currently in the midst of record, or almost record inflation in most countries across the world, which has sparked fears that a recession is imminent. Interest rates have been increased to record levels while inflation has increased up to double digits in many developed countries, while hyperinflation is resulting in serious repercussions for many developing countries such as Sri Lanka, which defaulted on its debt for the first time in history, and other countries like Pakistan and Turkey are battling with inflation too. Even though the cost of living increase has been astronomical, the increments or wage increases given by most companies have not even come close to dampening the effect of inflation. This means, that in real terms, people are actually earning less than they were in previous year. In countries outside the United States, most currencies have depreciated significantly against the dollar as it reaches record highs, which has simply added to the cost of living. Most workers are angry that their companies are not adjusting their salaries in line with the increase in cost of living, which has led to strikes and demand of their rights.Story continuesAnother interesting aspect of worker's rights has been the Great Resignation. The Great Resignation is an ongoing trend where employees are leaving their jobs en masse, in protest of working conditions and lack of benefits. Other reasons for mass quitting include wage stagnation and lack of career opportunities. During the pandemic, many businesses laid off their staff, with the United States alone accounting for 40 million unemployed people at one point in 2020, which meant nearly 25% of the total work force. Once business started picking up again as restrictions eased, the upper hand was with potential employees who knew that businesses were desperate for employees and so couldn't afford to bargain a lot. Because of this, many employees have left their current positions for better options.But perhaps one of the biggest reasons for many employees quitting their jobs is the normalization of remote work. When the pandemic hit the world, most countries went into long-term lockdowns, which necessitated work from home for most employees, wherever possible. This led to people realizing the benefits of working from home, which included flexibility, better work life balance, less costs incurred as a result of saving on meals and on transportation, and having more free time as a result of not having to commute. Once the restrictions subsided, many companies immediately went on the offensive, requiring their employees to come to office, if not every day, then most days. For employees who had settled on working remotely, or at least mostly remote, this was simply unacceptable and many refused to return to their jobs, instead opting for jobs where they could continue to work remotely.The biggest companies in the world by employees have to pay special attention to the relationship between a company and its employees, as for these companies, their employees are even more integral to their success. Most of the countries in our list belong to labor intensive industries such as retail or courier companies. Many of these companies have enough employees to fill a small city, and in fact in the case of one company, a city was established just for its employees. Ranking companies by the number of employees, with data taken from Fortune Global 500, let's take a look at the companies which altogether account for more than 14.5 million employees, starting with number 20:20. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Total number of employees in 2021: 420,000Among the largest supermarkets in the world, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) operates in 35 states in the United States. Operations of The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) include hypermarkets, supermarkets, department stores and even over a hundred jewelry stores. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is an exception in our list in the sense that most of its employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements, while many companies in our list are quite anti-union.19. Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of ChinaTotal number of employees in 2021: 434,089Considered to be one of the biggest companies in the world by number of assets, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is a behemoth which is also considered to be among the most profitable companies in the world.18. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Total number of employees in 2021: 450,000Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a department store in the United States which is considered to be among the biggest retailers in the country.

Agricultural Bank of ChinaTotal number of employees in 2021: 455,174One of the big four banks of China, the Agricultural Bank of China has more than 320 million retail customers and at least 2.7 million corporate clients across 27,000 branches.15. GazpromTotal number of employees in 2021: 468,000Gazprom is a Russian state-owned energy company and is the biggest company in Russia by revenue.

(NYSE:HD) has more than 2,300 locations globally.13. Jinneng Holding GroupTotal number of employees in 2021: 506,364Jinngeng Holding Group is the first in our list to cross half a million employees, and the company itself is a state-owned coal mining conglomerate.12. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)Total number of employees in 2021: 508,650There are a couple of courier companies, including FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), among the list of the biggest companies in the world by employees, which should come as no surprise considering how labor intensive running a courier company is. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is surprisingly one of the top contractors of the U.S. government and also provides assistance in the transportation of some United States Postal Service packages, which is another company in our list. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has close to 2,000 locations.11. Sinopec GroupTotal number of employees in 2021: 542,286The world's largest oil refining, gas and petrochemical conglomerate, Sinopec Group is among the largest companies in the world by revenue as well.10. Deutsche Post DHL GroupTotal number of employees in 2021: 548,042The German package delivery and courier company is easily among the biggest courier companies in the world, with revenues crossing 81.75 billion euros in 2021, and the return on equity being quite high at 27.7%.9. U.S. Postal ServiceTotal number of employees in 2021: 584,902The U.S. Postal Service is one of the few services which has been explicitly authorized by the U.S. Constitution. It can trace its roots back to 1775, and has a monopoly on letter delivery within the country. While you might think letters and mail are a relic of the past, having nearly 600,000 employees signifies that the traditional form of mail is going nowhere.8. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Total number of employees in 2021: 624,000Based in Dublin, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is an IT and consulting company which recorded revenues crossing $50 billion in 2021, with its clients including almost 75% of the companies making the Fortune Global 500 list.

VolkswagenTotal number of employees in 2021: 672,789Most of the biggest companies by employees are also the largest companies in their industry, hence necessitating the need of such a large number of employees, and Volkswagen is no exception. Founded under the Nazi party, the company was so massive that the city of Wolfsburg was built as a planned city to accommodate workers from Volkswagen. The company owns some of the biggest and most famous brands in the automotive industry including Audi, Bugatti, Ducati, Bentley, Porsche and Lamborghini among others.6. China Post GroupTotal number of employees in 2021: 748,920Postal companies of countries with high populations require a massive amount of labor, in what is a very labor intensive industry.

Taking a look at the NASDAQ, we've seen that move into positive territory. It's up by about half a percent right now. Changing this over to an intraday look, and perhaps we'll get fancy with some candlestick charts. Also, that's up by 51 points there. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, you're seeing that up by about 1% right now early in trade. And then additionally, the S&amp;P 500, that's up a little bit more than half a percent.I do want to dive into some of the retail names, though, here on the day as well, especially considering what Amazon had kind of warned within their earnings call after they reported earnings, saying that consumers are cutting their budgets and trying to save a little bit of money. And we'll make this equal weighted, just for the sake of giving you a fuller view of what's taking place in some of the retail landscape, perhaps investors taking warning to that comment from Amazon on that call. Amazon, of course, on the day, down by about 10%.But look at some of the other names that are also moving in concert with it in the retail sector right now. You've got Target down by about 1.9%. You've also got Wayfair and, yeah, Sozzi's favorite, Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, down by about 8.6% here. However, holding on to some gains here to end out the week, you've got Walmart still in positive territory. That's up by about 2/10 of a percent there. Perhaps the brick and mortar play, investors leaning into that. Nike is also up by about 4/10 of a percent right now, too. So we'll keep a close eye on this retail sector as we move on.BRIAN SOZZI: To be clear, Brad, Bed, Bath is not my-- it's Costco.BRAD SMITH: Ah, yes.BRIAN SOZZI: Costco, that $1.50 hot dog. What they have done this past year, keeping prices at $1.50 in this inflationary environment, I mean, that's impressive.BRAD SMITH: I don't want to confuse our viewers with my sarcasm, so I will-- yes.BRIAN SOZZI: I appreciate you.]"

Halloween is also no more specific to kids dressing up as ghosts and ghouls, and trick-or-treating. It is more of a party event now.Per NRF, participation in Halloween-related activities will bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, with 69% of consumers planning to celebrate the holiday this year, up from 65% in 2021 and comparable to 68% in 2019. Total spending is likely to be $10.6 billion, up from $10.1 billion recorded in 2021 and $8.8 billion in 2019.As retailers brace for a holiday season, many are planning to boost sales early by flaunting a wider assortment of Halloween merchandise. Even if consumers are cutting back on spending elsewhere, they say Halloween gives people an opportunity to get into the holiday spirit with relatively cheap celebrations before Thanksgiving and Christmas. The kick around Halloween also comes on the heels of easing COVID-19 restrictions.The top ways consumers plan to celebrate include handing out candy (67%), decorating their home or yard (51%), dressing up in costume (47%), carving a pumpkin (44%) and throwing or attending a Halloween party (28%). Similar to last year, one in five plan to dress their pet up in a costume.ETF PicksVanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH)The underlying MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index tracks the overall performance of companies involved in retail distribution, wholesalers, on-line, direct mail and TV retailers, multi-line retailers, specialty retailers and food and other staples retailers.SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT)The underlying S&amp;P Retail Select Industry Index represents the retail sub-industry portion of the S&amp;P TMI.

Pet spending is also expected to exceed 2021’s record high sales, hitting $710 million. This very well makes PAWZ a buy.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for CSX Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.56bUS$3.73bUS$3.76bUS$3.89bUS$3.99bUS$4.08bUS$4.18bUS$4.27bUS$4.36bUS$4.45bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.24%Est @ 2.16%Est @ 2.11%Est @ 2.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.1kUS$3.0kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$28bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$90bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$90b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$46bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$74b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$29.2, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CSX as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.077. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For CSX, we've put together three important elements you should explore:Risks: Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for CSX  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does CSX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Part of the Group's award-winning cruise line, Royal Caribbean International, the use of renewable fuel will reduce the ship's carbon emissions.Navigator of the Seas Renewable DieselThis key step in the Group's pursuit of alternative fuels comes less than a year after the unveiling of Destination Net Zero, Royal Caribbean Group's comprehensive decarbonization strategy.""We are committed to investing in technologies and innovations that will help us reduce emissions and fulfill our purpose to deliver great vacations responsibly,"" said Laura Hodges Bethge, Royal Caribbean Group's Executive Vice President, Shared Services Operations. ""As we celebrate this milestone, we continue to set our sights on other leading alternative solutions to meet our net zero goals.""The renewable fuel being used by Navigator of the Seas contains less carbon than traditional marine fuels. While this fuel is produced from renewable raw materials, the production process for this fuel makes it molecularly identical to traditional marine gas oil — creating a ""drop in"" fuel that can be safely used with the ship's existing engines.The cruise company plans to continue using lower carbon fuel to meet part of the Los Angeles-based ship's fuel needs as it evaluates the feasibility for long-term use, with ambitions to expand its usage to other ships across the fleet. This follows a similar trial by the Group's joint venture partner, Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, which is exploring a different process for developing a sustainable biofuel.For the trial, Royal Caribbean Group has partnered with World Fuel Services to supply the renewable fuel to Navigator of the Seas. The Jankovich Company will deliver the fuel on behalf of World Fuel Services to the ship while at the Port of Los Angeles. Once fueled, Navigator of the Seas will set sail to Mexico.Story continues""We are extremely proud to be a part of Royal Caribbean Group's journey toward making the cruise industry more sustainable by leveraging our renewable fuel distribution capabilities and technical expertise to facilitate the use of renewable fuel in a marine application,"" said Michael J. Kasbar, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, World Fuel Services Corporation.In addition to testing the use of biofuel aboard Navigator of the Seas, Royal Caribbean Group is set to debut the cruise industry's first hybrid-powered ship in summer 2023, as part of Silversea Cruises newest class of ships, the Nova class. The Group is also working to reduce emissions while at port by investing in shore power on its ships and collaborating with key cruise ports for its use. For example, in 2021, Royal Caribbean Group signed an agreement to bring shore power to PortMiami, which will enable ships to use electricity at port instead of burning fuel. The company also is introducing a new zero-energy cruise terminal in the Port of Galveston, Texas, that builds on its sustainable design efforts and will be a LEED-Gold certified facility.To learn more about Royal Caribbean Group's sustainability efforts, visit https://sustainability.rclcorporate.com/.About Royal Caribbean Group: Royal Caribbean Group (NYSE: RCL) is one of the leading cruise companies in the world with a global fleet of 64 ships traveling to approximately 1,000 destinations around the world.

(NYSE:V) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of December to $0.45. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 0.9% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Visa Visa's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Before making this announcement, Visa was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 46.8%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 16% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendVisa Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.22 total annually to $1.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 23% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Visa has grown earnings per share at 23% per year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.We Really Like Visa's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Visa is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

193,dd095699-a64f-35aa-8545-f73e4a993760,VZ,2022-10-29,Improved Earnings Required Before Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) Shares Find Their Feet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improved-earnings-required-verizon-communications-120058233.html,1667044858,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE:VZ) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 8.2x might make it look like a buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 15x and even P/E's above 28x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Verizon Communications' earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. The P/E is probably low because investors think this poor earnings performance isn't going to get any better. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications peKeen to find out how analysts think Verizon Communications' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Verizon Communications' is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 14%. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 18% in total. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 4.6% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.9% per year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Verizon Communications' P/E sits below the majority of other companies. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Verizon Communications' P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.We've established that Verizon Communications maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast growth being lower than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Verizon Communications that you need to be mindful of.You might be able to find a better investment than Verizon Communications.

(VZ): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-verizon-communications-130001708.html,1666962001,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -6.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.19 points to a change of -3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.13 indicates a change of -1.2% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.26 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $136.8 billion and $138.96 billion estimates indicate +2.4% and +1.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $34.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +3.13%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

206,dabfd94c-6afd-3dbc-8d74-2acbab6e3ab1,TRV,2022-10-29,7 Dow Stocks to Sell Before They Tumble,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dow-stocks-sell-tumble-160405156.html,1666713845,STORY,"['HD', 'DIS', 'AAPL', 'NKE', 'CVX', 'TRV', 'MMM']","[As anyone who reads my columns regularly knows, I’m generally upbeat on stocks. That’s because I believe that inflation has peaked, the Federal Reserve is poised to become much more dovish.  In addition, the Street has, for some time, underestimated the importance of the exceptionally strong employment market. However, I believe that there are some good Dow stocks to sell at this point.That’s because, in this stock picker’s market, there are several sectors that investors should definitely avoid. For example, with  consumers being hurt by inflation and many still spending much more money on experiences than products, companies that specialize in selling fairly expensive products may struggle. While that trend should reverse at some point in the medium term, given the negative commentary of a number of companies that specialize in selling goods and poor macro manufacturing data, it appears to have been stickier than I previously believed.That’s particularly true for firms whose products are relatively expensive but rely on attracting lower-middle-class and working class-consumers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOil companies may also be hurt by governments actions, while insurers could struggle due to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Ian, for example.With all of that in mind, here are seven good Dow stocks to sell.AAPLApple$151.33TRVTravelers Companies$176.65CVXChevron$174.38MMM3M$117.90HDHome Depot$290.06DISDisney$103.57PGProcter &amp; Gamble$130.27Apple (AAPL)An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the backgroundSource: askarim / ShutterstockThere’s now clear evidence that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is getting being hurt by a goods-to-services shift. According to a recent report, weak demand for the iPhone 14 has caused the hardware giant to lower the “production of iPhone 14 Plus and is increasing the output of the more expensive iPhone 14 Pro.”Also expressing caution about Apple on CNBC was investor Brenda Vingiello, who warned that the company could be hit by waning consumer demand for PCs and smartphones in the wake of the pandemic. Additionally, she noted that AAPL gets 60% of its revenue from outside of the U.S. Some of those overseas markets, especially China and Europe, have problems that are much worse than those of America. Additionally, the U.S. dollar’s strength is likely to negatively impact Apple’s overseas profits.Story continuesDespite these issues, the price-earnings ratio of AAPL stock remains fairly elevated at 23.4. That’s fairly high for a company whose revenues are growing relatively slowly; on average, analysts expect the firm’s revenues to increase 4.8% to $412 billion in 2023, up from $393 billion this year.Travelers Companies (TRV)Red umbrella covering stacks of billsSource: ShutterstockTravelers Companies’ (NYSE:TRV) third-quarter results, reported on Oct. 19, were uninspiring, thanks to Hurricane Ian. Specifically, its net income sank to $454 million versus $662 million during the same period in 2021. Additionally, its top line increased just 6%. On a positive note, its revenue from its “net written premiums” climbed 10% year over year. Still, Ian caused the firm’s “catastrophe costs” to jump 11% year over year to “$512 million pretax, net of reinsurance, from the year-earlier period,” The Wall Street Journal’s Leslie Scism reported.Ian could have been much worse for Travelers, but TRV and other companies had decided to offer relatively few homeowners’ insurance policies in the hurricane-prone state. However, with climate change causing the damage and frequency of storms to increase a great deal, the next extremely ruinous hurricane, flood, or tornado could occur in a highly populated state to which Travelers is much more exposed. Such an event, in turn, could cause TRV stock to sink meaningfully. Consequently, I urge investors to sell TRV and its peers.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comMany haven’t realized it yet, but the world recently changed for Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and its peers in the oil and gas sector. Specifically, Western governments are no longer sitting on their hands as oil and gas prices soar; instead, these governments are realizing that they can take actions that stymie price jumps caused by the “animal spirits” of profit-hungry traders.In the U.S., the Biden Administration’s releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) have caused oil prices to sink. Meanwhile, the EU’s actions have caused European natural gas prices to tumble to around prewar levels. Once investors internalize the idea that Washington and Europe are determined to prevent oil and gas prices from soaring, their appetite for CVX stock is likely to take a big hit.Also worth noting is that 30 leftist members of Congress recently signed a letter to President Joe Biden calling on him to work harder to end the war in Ukraine. If pressure ramps up on the administration and on European governments to end the war, the fighting could indeed stop sooner rather than later, causing oil and gas prices to sink and meaningfully pushing down CVX stock.3M (MMM)Source: Shutterstock3M (NYSE:MMM) just reported weak third-quarter results. Meanwhile, the company is facing a number of lawsuits that could significantly undermine its financial position. It’s another one of the top Dow stocks to sell.3M’s sales dropped 4% year-over-year to $8.6 billion, while its operating cash flow tumbled 18% year over year. Additionally, 3M cut its 2022 sales guidance, and now expects its revenue to fall 3% to 3.5% this year, as compared to its previous outlook for a 0.5%-2.5% decline. The conglomerate anticipates that its sales, excluding acquisitions, will climb 1.5% to 2% this year. But given the current, high-inflation environment, that’s a very unimpressive increase indeed.Meanwhile, over 230,000 lawsuits have been filed against 3M for its allegedly damaging earplugs. Partially because of the legal issue, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently reiterated its “underperform” rating on the shares.On Aug. 29, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Joshua Pokrzywinski estimated that 3M’s liability for the earplugs could reach $14 billion with potential for something higher. The analyst kept an “underweight” rating on the shares. As of the end of last quarter, 3M has $3 billion of cash and $17.2 billion of debt, so $14 billion of liability would indeed greatly undermine its financial position at best and make its viability going forward uncertain at worst.The firm is trying to spin off its healthcare unit, likely in order to prevent the parent company from being hurt by the lawsuits. However, the move has been challenged in court.Home Depot (HD)Source: ShutterstockThe tremendous slowdown in the housing sector, along with the goods-to-services spending shift, isn’t great news for Home Depot (NYSE:HD). It’s another one of the top Dow stocks to sell.In September, U.S. existing home sales fell 1.5% versus August and tumbled 24% year-over-year.“Three out of the four major U.S. regions notched month-over-month sales contractions, while the West held steady. On a year-over-year basis, sales dropped in all regions,” the National Association of Realtors reported. The continuing housing slump is bad news for Home Depot, as consumers tend to spend a great deal of money to improve the homes into which they move.Further, as consumers spend more money on experiences, they’ll have less to spend on upgrading their homes. Much like Apple, Home Depot benefited a great deal from spending patterns during the pandemic. Now that those patterns have reversed, HD’s financial results are likely to sink. Also boding badly for HD stock, research firm Evercore recently lowered its rating on Home Depot’s competitor, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) to in-line from outperform.“Our downgrade is based on the view that slower [home improvement] demand and disinflation could push comps lower in 2023, making margin gains muted,” the firm explained. While Evercore said it was more bullish on HD stock, I still think that the firm’s assessment of Lowe’s indicates that investors should not expect good news anytime soon from Home Depot.Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockI’ve been bearish on Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock for a few years, citing the negative impacts of the cord-cutting trend. The Street finally realized the truth of these points, causing DIS stock to tumble 34% so far this year.   But with those trends continuing and DIS still trading at a relatively high forward price-earnings ratio of 19, the shares are likely to decline much further going forward. It’s another one of the top Dow stocks to sell.Ominously for Disney, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) predicted in Aug. that cord cutting would continue to be “elevated given all the content shifting to streaming, and consumers looking to trim their subscriptions due to macro and/or subscription fatigue,” In Q2, the number of consumers paying traditional TV bills fell “5.2% year-over-year,” the firm noted, worse than the 3.7% decline in Q1. For 2022, 2023, and 2024, Wells expects the metric to sink 5.8%, 6.7%, and 6.9%, respectively.  Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock has a rather high price-earnings ratio of 22. That’s because many investors are predicting that the economy will nosedive over the next year and see PG as a safe haven. But, as I’ve stated in the past, I believe that the strong employment trend, along with America’s first manufacturing boom in many decades, will prevent the economy from meaningfully sinking.If I’m correct (and so far I have been), then the valuation multiples of PG stock are likely to sink tremendously going forward. Further reducing the attractiveness of PG, its profitability actually fell last quarter, as its operating income dropped to $4.93 billion from $5.02 billion during the same period a year earlier. And in its fiscal 2022, its OI declined to $18.6 billion from $18.7 billion during the prior year.On Oct. 10, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the PG stock to neutral from buy, citing valuation. The firm does not believe that PG’s market share is likely to rise going forward.Nike (NKE)Nike (NYSE:NKE) is one of the top Dow stocks to sell.  With consumers spending much more money on experiences, they have less money left over to spend on Nike’s rather expensive footwear. Adding to Nike’s woes, the company relies on China for a significant amount of its revenue. In its fiscal first quarter, Nike’s sales rose only 3.6% year-over-year. Given the high-inflation environment, that’s not an impressive increase. Meanwhile, the company’s gross margin sank 2.2 percentage points YOY to 44.3%.And perhaps most importantly, the footwear maker’s inventories soared 44% YOY. While the company blamed the increase on “supply chain”issues, I would not be surprised if weaker-than-expected demand also actually played a significant role in the inventory jump.Expressing caution on NKE stock on Oct. 11, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) wrote, “We would like to see progress on clearing through the excess inventory and have better visibility on China demand before turning more constructive on the name.” The firm kept a neutral rating on NKE stock.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

207,774a363e-9a17-37ae-8c65-9bba875f86bd,FOX,2022-10-29,FuboTV Inc. (FUBO) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fubotv-inc-fubo-expected-beat-140002097.html,1666965602,STORY,"['FUBO', 'FOXA']","[FuboTV Inc. (FUBO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -25.4%.Revenues are expected to be $211.47 million, up 35% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.42% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for fuboTV Inc.For fuboTV Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.70%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that fuboTV Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that fuboTV Inc. Would post a loss of $0.69 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.63, delivering a surprise of +8.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.FuboTV Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, Fox (FOXA) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.2 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Fox has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.87%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fox will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yet more can be done to make STEM accessible to more girls globally and provide diverse representation.Each of Cummins' key regions hosted activities the week of Oct. 10, many of which incorporated employees' children or connected them with students in the community. One young girl in India who participated in a Cummins event said, ""Today was another step in getting to know myself better and what I want for my future.""Research indicates that girls with role models in STEM are more likely to pursue opportunities in these fields. All the Cummins events were designed to encourage more girls to pursue STEM careers. For example:In Beijing, China, more than 2,000 Cummins employees participated in delivering STEM educational programs to young female students. Nathan Stoner, Vice President of the China Area Business Organization for Cummins, gave an opening speech. The local Community Involvement Team launched a virtual STEM course for primary school students located thousands of kilometers away.In San Luis Potosi, Mexico, 110 Cummins employees held a STEM fair for 300 students from five nearby schools. Together with two nonprofits, they provided STEM experiments, Lego builds, robotics information, a research and development tour, virtual reality experiences and testimonials from female Cummins engineers.At several sites in Brazil, more than 100 Cummins employees offered plant tours to almost 300 children and teenagers so they could see female workers playing important roles in technical areas. Women in the technical field talked about their careers and highlighted the importance of STEM education for women and girls. They also participated in STEM activities, such as programming and robotics.In Zambia, more than 250 students from a local secondary school participated in a STEM engagement session with Cummins employees.Story continuesIn Cummins' headquarters community of Columbus, Indiana (U.S.), President and CEO Jennifer Rumsey joined several Cummins employees in meeting with 15 high school students from nearby Brown County. Together they visited the company's Columbus Engine Plant, touring the battery assembly line and saw a Cummins electric test truck.They also toured the Additive Manufacturing lab, which produces 3D-printed metal parts. The day helped expose the students to a wide range of STEM opportunities within Cummins - from manufacturing associates, research and development lab technicians, service engineering, technical administrative associates, trainers and more.The team talked about the challenging and interesting careers in these areas and that starting a STEM career doesn't require a college degree - apprenticeships and two-year degrees are common.""One of the things I love most about my job is being able to share my experience with other women to empower and encourage them to get involved in manufacturing,"" said Hayley McMahan, Senior Manufacturing Engineer at Cummins. ""Events like these are what will help increase the female workforce in manufacturing!""Cummins Inc., Friday, October 28, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info: Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: http://cummins.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722829/Cummins-Promotes-STEM-in-Global-Celebrations-of-International-Day-of-the-Girl]"
209,89db2700-2466-3742-ab17-1d2dd7a233c3,CMI,2022-10-29,4 High Earnings Yield Picks That You Shouldn't Ignore,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-high-earnings-yield-picks-125612063.html,1666961772,STORY,"['JAZZ', 'CMI', 'ALB']","[Investors often use the P/E ratio and other valuation metrics to pick undervalued stocks with solid upside potential. One can also use another interesting ratio. Earnings yield, expressed in percentage, is calculated as (Annual Earnings per Share/Market Price) x 100. While comparing stocks, if other factors are similar, investors can look out for stocks with higher earnings yield. This is because stocks with higher earnings yield have the potential of providing comparatively greater returns. Albemarle Corporation ALB, Chevron Corporation CVX, Jazz Pharmaceuticals JAZZ and Cummins Inc. CMI are some stocks boasting high earnings yield.Just like the case with dividend yield, firms with higher earnings yield are considered underpriced, while those with lower earnings yield are seen as overpriced. Earnings yield captures both the tangible and intangible yield of a firm, as opposed to dividend yield, which only takes into account the tangible yield.Importantly, earnings yield can also be used to compare the performance of a market index with the 10-year Treasury yield. For instance, when the yield of the market index is more than the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be considered as undervalued than bonds. In this situation, investing in the stock market would be a better option for a value investor.Earnings Yield: Simply the Inverse of P/EEarnings yield is nothing but the reciprocal of one of the most popular valuation metrics, i.e., the P/E ratio (stock price/earnings per share). In fact, as the concept of earnings yield is already indirectly captured in the P/E ratio, earnings yield as an investment valuation metric is not as widely used as the P/E ratio.Having said that, it should be noted that earnings yield is an important tool for investors with exposure to both stocks and bonds. In fact, with regard to this, earnings yield can be more illuminating than the traditional P/E ratio, as the former facilitates the comparison of stocks with fixed-income securities.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyWe have set an Earnings Yield greater than 10% as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential of generating solid returns. So, we have added the following parameters to the screen:Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S&amp;P 500: This metric compares the 12-month forward EPS estimate with the 12-month actual EPS.Average Daily Volume (20 Day) greater than or equal to 100,000: High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity.Current Price greater than or equal to $5.Buy-Rated Stocks: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our PicksHere we discuss four of the 131 stocks that qualified the screen:Albemarle: Charlotte-based Albemarle is a premier specialty chemicals company with leading positions in attractive end markets globally.Albemarle remains focused on strengthening its lithium business and is taking actions to grow its key businesses. It is also expected to gain from synergies of the Rockwood acquisition and cost actions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALB’s 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 430.7% and 124%, respectively. The 2022 bottom-line estimate has been revised upward by 16 cents a share over the past seven days.Chevron: California-based Chevron is one of the leading integrated oil and gas companies. The acquisition of Noble Energy has expanded Chevron’s presence in the DJ Basin and the Permian Basin.The takeover is also estimated to generate significant cost savings. The company’s strong financials augur well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVX’s 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 127.3% and 46%, respectively. The 2022 bottom-line estimate has been revised upward by $1.1 a share over the past seven days.Jazz: Ireland-based Jazz is a specialty biopharmaceutical company with a focus in the areas of neuroscience and oncology. The acquisition of GW Pharma diversified its commercial portfolio by adding a third high-growth commercial franchise of cannabidiol drugs to the business. Jazz’s revenues continue to benefit from strong demand for newer drugs like Xywav, Epidiolex and Rylaze.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JAZZ’s 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 7% and 18%, respectively. The 2022 bottom-line estimate has been revised upward by 2 cents a share over the past seven days.Cummins: Cummins is the largest engine producer in the world and maintains a diverse global footprint. Its position as a global power leader with dominant market and commitment to moving toward a carbon-neutral future is commendable.The buyout of Meritor positions Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across internal combustion and electric power applications.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMI’s 2022 earnings and sales implies year-over-year growth of 18.4% and 12%, respectively. The 2022 bottom-line estimate has been revised upward by 2 cents a share over the past seven days.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for a 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Walt Disney Company (DIS), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Walt Disney’s shares have declined -32.6% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s decline of -30.2%. The Zacks analyst believes that Disney+’s profitability in recent times was negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney’s leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.However, the company continues to benefit from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. Availability in the Nordics, Latin America and other Asian territories is helping it expand its user base. Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both the domestic and international parks.(You can read the full research report on Walt Disney here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Broadcom have declined -31.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s decline of -40.4%. The Zacks analyst believes that increasing competition, along with high debt levels, are persistent overhangs. But Broadcom did report impressive third-quarter fiscal 2022 results. Top-line growth was driven by strength in cloud and service provider segments. Networking is riding on strong adoption of Broadcom’s next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers. Aggressive adoption of its next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth.Story continuesBroadcom expects fiscal fourth-quarter networking and server storage revenues to grow 30% and 45% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. An upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 guidance is encouraging. The VMware acquisition will aid prospects over the long term.(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of PayPal have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past three-month period (+0.9% vs. -16.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that PayPal is benefiting from growing total payments volume owing to increasing net new active accounts. Strengthening customer engagement on the company’s platform is a major positive. Further, Venmo’s improving monetization efforts and rising adoption rate across various platforms are aiding the total active accounts growth.However, intensifying competition in the digital payment market poses a serious risk to the company’s market position.

Increased margins and net interest revenues on rising interest rates will likely support top-line growth.Valero (VLO) Gains On Higher Gulf Coast Refinery ThroughputThe Zacks analyst is impressed by Valero's Gulf Coast refineries, contributing the most to its total throughput volumes. Higher Gulf Coast export volumes will also support its margins.Expanding Solar Market to Boost Enphase Energy (ENPH) GrowthPer the Zacks analyst, the expanding solar market that has set the stage for the solar microinverter market's boom tends to benefit Enphase as it remains a leading U.S. manufacturer of microinverters.New DowngradesMasco (MAS) Ails From Lower Demand, Higher Operational CostsPer the Zacks analyst, Masco is witnessing low demand and foreign currency headwinds.

The ComEd EVs for Education program, which provides schools funding to offset the cost of an EV and EV charger, will give students first-hand experience driving EVs and learning about new zero-emissions vehicles on the rise in Illinois and across the country.ComEd is now accepting applications for the 2023 program year. Schools interested in participating are encouraged to apply now until the deadline of Dec. 31, 2022. The application can be found on ComEd’s website.""Thanks in part to Illinois’ Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), EVs are gaining popularity in Illinois, and ComEd is taking steps to prepare the next generation for the new era of technology that’s proven to lower harmful tailpipe emissions and improve air quality for all our communities,"" said Gil Quiniones, CEO of ComEd. ""ComEd is proud to partner with school communities across the region to power education programs that will help remove barriers to EV use and inspire drivers to embrace this exciting new technology that is key to our clean energy future.""ComEd made the announcement from Taft High School, located on Chicago’s northwest side, which received an EVs for Education grant in 2020, using it to purchase two new Chevy Bolts and two new charging stations for use in driver education. Since its launch in 2019, ComEd has directed $700,000 to 14 schools across northern Illinois, including six CPS schools.Five new schools have been identified to participate in the 2022 program, including:Dwight Township High School, Dwight, Ill.Glenbard North High School, Carol Stream, Ill.Harvard High School, Harvard, Ill.Jefferson High School, Rockford, Ill.Lane Tech College Prep High School, ChicagoStory continues""Today’s students have more interest in electric vehicles than any previous generation, which is why it’s crucial that we introduce them to this experience as they learn the rules of the road,"" said Pedro Martinez, CEO of Chicago Public Schools. ""Working with ComEd, we are expanding this unique curriculum to new Chicago high schools every year and inspiring a new generation to take on new technologies that are key to our future.""Schools invited to participate in EVs for Education receive a $50,000 grant to help electrify their driver education curriculum by adding an EV to their existing vehicle fleet and purchasing at least one Level 2 charger. In addition to providing students with experience behind the wheel of an EV, the program teaches them to identify the vehicle’s basic components, understand charging requirements and different types of charging equipment, and how to operate and charge an EV responsibly.In addition to removing cost barriers that some school communities face in incorporating EVs, the program provides students and educators first-hand experiences with new forms of technology. ComEd teamed up with the Illinois High School &amp; College Driver Education Association to create curriculum for the EVs for Education program.""The ComEd EVs for Education Grant program is delivering new vehicles and equipment that will help thousands of public high school driver education students take steps to learn the rules of the road using electric vehicles,"" said Wayne Hartmann, Board Representative for the Illinois High School &amp; College Driver Education Association. ""In addition to putting students in touch with cutting edge equipment, new curriculum we’ve helped developed for this program will help familiarize students with differences of driving and maintaining EVs, including charging methods. With EVs gaining more and more popularity in Illinois, the work ComEd is doing is essential to a safe adoption of this new technology by our newest drivers.""To be eligible for an EVs for Education grant, applicants must be a public school driver education program, and be located in the ComEd service region. Applicants are prioritized if they are located within diverse communities or communities underserved by EV access/charging. More on program requirements can be found in the application.""We are extremely excited to partner with ComEd and provide an amazing opportunity to the students of Harvard High School and future generations of CUSD 50 students and families,"" said Katey Dietz, driver education team lead at Harvard High School. ""In line with CUSD 50’s strategic plan, this partnership offers a variety of different vehicles for our students to learn with. With the support of this grant, Harvard High School along with the Harvard Community Education Foundation will be able to take steps so that our students can be exposed to green technology they may not yet have had the opportunity to see, let alone use. The EVs for Education program opens learning opportunities for our driver’s education students that would not be possible otherwise.""EVs for Education is just one example of how ComEd is working to prepare communities for the rise in EV adoption expected in Illinois. Recent legislation passed by the state of Illinois and the federal government confront climate change in part by incentivizing the adoption of EVs, especially as transportation is the single biggest contributor of carbon pollution in the U.S. today. Through CEJA, Illinois has set forward clear markers on how to reduce carbon emissions, including a plan to add 1 million EVs to the roads by 2030.""Dwight Township High School is pleased to partner with ComEd and to be a recipient of the EV grant,"" said Dwight Public Schools Superintendent, Josh DeLong. ""DTHS will use these funds to purchase an electric vehicle which will help us by having a much needed second driver's education vehicle, while at the same time teaching our students the benefits of electric cars. Thank you ComEd!""ComEd is preparing its communities to unlock the benefits of EVs, which are proven to reduce carbon emissions, to enhance air quality, all while saving consumers on money otherwise spent at the pump. To support customers in navigating the journey to EVs, ComEd has introduced the EV Toolkit – an all-in-one resource providing information and tips on available resources and rebates, rate plans and cost savings options, where to find charging stations, and more.Additionally, ComEd earlier this month announced a new DOE-funded grant that will enhance ongoing work to test the integration of extreme fast charging stations, a key component in not only growing the network of charging stations across the region, but helping to promote widespread adoption of EVs.For more information on the benefits of EVs or to receive support from ComEd on an electrification project, customers are encouraged to visit our website or to reach out at EVsmart@comed.comComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

(OKE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-oke-attracting-investor-130001643.html,1666962001,STORY,['OKE'],"[Oneok Inc. (OKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this natural gas company have returned +13.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, which Oneok falls in, has gained 13.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Oneok is expected to post earnings of $0.94 per share, indicating a change of +6.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.69 points to a change of +10.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.14 indicates a change of +12.1% from what Oneok is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Oneok.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Oneok, the consensus sales estimate of $6.52 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +43.7%. The $23.99 billion and $23.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +45% and -3.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOneok reported revenues of $6 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +77%. EPS of $0.92 for the same period compares with $0.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.37 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.81%. The EPS surprise was +9.52%.Over the last four quarters, Oneok surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oneok is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oneok. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$980m in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 16% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of M&amp;T Bank, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About M&amp;T Bank?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that M&amp;T Bank does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at M&amp;T Bank's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in M&amp;T Bank. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.4% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of M&amp;T BankWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that M&amp;T Bank Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$142m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in M&amp;T Bank. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, F5 Networks has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Paypal has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FFIV is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.FFIV currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.11, while PYPL has a forward P/E of 22.22. We also note that FFIV has a PEG ratio of 1.14. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PYPL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.39.Another notable valuation metric for FFIV is its P/B ratio of 3.37. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PYPL has a P/B of 5.11.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help FFIV earn a Value grade of B, while PYPL has been given a Value grade of C.FFIV stands above PYPL thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that FFIV is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sticking with earnings, Colgate-Palmolive panned by investors after the consumer packaged goods company reported a sales miss, despite raising prices. This as inflation and a cloudy economic outlook continue. Probably one of the more disappointing quarters from a consumer packaged goods company, but still another company I think is doing some pretty innovative things.

It works.BRAD SMITH: Really?BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: All right, I got to get me one of those.JULIE HYMAN: So isn't it just, like, whiting out your teeth?BRIAN SOZZI: And you sleep with it. It took a little while to get-- it took a little while to get used to it.JULIE HYMAN: Just paint your teeth.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, all very healthy.JULIE HYMAN: I'm sure.BRAD SMITH: I mean, it comes down to how they're moving inventory continuously into some of the storefronts that are the most massive retailers as well-- Target, Walmart-- and where consumers are also leaning into some of those household name brands versus perhaps trying out some of, even in the tradedown, trying out some of the homegrown brands at a Target or a Walmart.JULIE HYMAN: Well, the difference here between some of the other consumer brand companies we've heard from, like the Procter &amp; Gambles of the world, is they raised prices enough to offset any volume declines, or if not declines in volume, slowdown. And that doesn't seem to have succeeded enough to the same extent--[BUZZER]--in Colgate-Palmolive, so.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.81 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this consumer products maker would post earnings of $0.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72, delivering a surprise of 1.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Colgate-Palmolive , which belongs to the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, posted revenues of $4.46 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.97%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.41 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Colgate-Palmolive shares have lost about 14.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.1%.What's Next for Colgate-Palmolive?While Colgate-Palmolive has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Colgate-Palmolive: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.80 on $4.52 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.01 on $17.9 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Soap and Cleaning Materials is currently in the bottom 23% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

The gathering brought together more than 100 executives, program directors, community leaders, public officials, and other key stakeholders from around the Golden State working to close the digital divide and create digital equity. The goals of the summit were to highlight best practices; learn more about the current and future needs of vulnerable communities; and identify challenges, solutions, and available funding resources. The summit also served as a moment to celebrate the work of Comcast’s valued digital equity partners across California, who worked throughout the pandemic to help drive Internet adoption and provide digital literacy training for those in need.In addition, the company announced it has exceeded its expanded goal to launch 1,250 Lift Zones before the end of this year. Comcast’s award-winning Lift Zones program provides free WiFi access in neighborhood community centers nationwide. Since September 2020, Lift Zones have enabled nearly 6 million free WiFi user sessions for students, veterans, seniors, and adults.According to a consumer survey of users who visited a Lift Zone:4 in 10 report they would not have had Internet access without the Lift Zone.50% of low-income households in major Comcast markets are within walking distance of a Lift Zone.58% of Lift Zone users strongly believe that the site helps them achieve more.58% report the Lift Zone reduces stress with studying, working remotely, and/or managing tasks online.56% say the Lift Zone is critical for success at school, work, and/or managing tasks online.92 percent of sites report that being a Lift Zone helps them increase digital equity in their communities.The Lift Zones program is part of Comcast’s Project UP – a comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity and build a future of unlimited possibilities. Backed by a $1 billion commitment, Project UP will help reach tens of millions of people with the skills, resources, and opportunities needed to succeed in a digital world.Story continues“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity right now to help connect the unconnected,” said Broderick Johnson, EVP of Digital Equity and EVP of Public Policy, Comcast Corporation. “Working together between Comcast, our nonprofit partners, and the state and federal government, we will connect more households to the Internet and help even more people take advantage of critical resources such as the federal Affordable Connectivity Program and digital skills training.”“Comcast’s continued partnership and dedication to our communities have resulted in allowing more students, children, seniors, and families to get connected to the Internet, “said San Francisco Mayor London Breed. “Public-private partnerships like these allow us to ensure that all of our communities have access to services they need to thrive.”Comcast’s Lift Zones were initially created in partnership with city leaders and nonprofit partners to help keep students connected to schools during the early stages of the pandemic. These digital navigators helped countless communities at a time when they needed it the most. Even as students return to their classrooms, Comcast continues to see strong demand for Lift Zones that serve underrepresented populations and offer an array of digital literacy programs, access to online healthcare services, workforce development training, and digital navigator support.“Thanks to Comcast, we’ve been able to connect many of our families to the Internet with high-speed WiFi to support a dynamic learning environment for their children,” said Gloria Corral, President, and CEO of Parent Institute for Quality Education. “Today’s Digital Equity Summit confirms Comcast’s commitment to the communities we serve. I am eager to see how today’s conversation will improve and help support the lives of the children and families.”In addition to the Lift Zone program, which earlier this year won SXSW’s “People’s Choice Award,” Comcast is proud to participate in the Federal Government’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). ACP provides eligible households with a $30/month subsidy that can be applied toward their Internet service. When used to pay for Comcast’s Internet Essentials service, home broadband Internet is effectively free.Powered by a Comcast Business solution, the company has installed more than 150 Lift Zones across the state of California.

It is crucial to ensure that these trusted local leaders have the tools they need to reach even more people with connectivity.It was announced at the summit that Comcast is doubling the upload speed of Internet Essentials Plus, which is available to eligible families at no cost thanks to the Affordable Connectivity Program.The core of my passion for digital equity lies in partnership. It's what comes up most frequently when I'm talking with the organizations that are in our communities doing the work and with government officials at every level.What is an effective partnership when it comes to closing the digital divide? The answer is very different today than it was a decade ago, when Comcast first launched our Internet Essentials program.Fast forward 11 years, today at the Comcast Technology Center in Philadelphia, I had the pleasure of spending time connecting with and listening to hundreds of Comcast's digital equity allies at the inaugural Project UP Partner Summit.200+ community leadersThe two-day summit brought together more than 200 nonprofit leaders from across the nation to network with one another and to participate in digital equity activities, including hearing from expert speakers, participating in workshops, and sharing best practices.To kick off the day, it was my privilege to introduce FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a demonstrated leader in advancing digital equity. NBC News reporter Zinhle Essamuah then conducted a keynote interview with Commissioner Starks.Among the many compelling observations the Commissioner made today was this: ""These are fundamental issues of fairness and fundamental issues of equity. But it is a complex problem.""Story continuesHe then went on to outline what he sees as the three main issues that we face: access, affordability, and adoption.Government at all levels: local, state, and federal, will be an invaluable partner going forward as tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure funds are distributed and committed to projects over the next decade. It's on all of us to ensure those funds are used most efficiently to connect every home to the Internet and critically, give folks the tools to be successful and safe online.Commissioner Starks also touched on efforts to eliminate disparities in broadband adoption rates for communities of color, considering of all Americans without a broadband subscription, 35% are Hispanic and 29% are Black.It was noteworthy to watch this conversation while sitting among an audience of on-the-ground leaders who see the impact of these efforts in their communities. And the Commissioner credited them with much of the success we've seen, but also challenged us all to continue to innovate.""It's really, especially back to your question about communities of color - the trusted community member and organization telling a fellow neighbor, ‘you know about this program, right?""GEOFFREY STARKS, FCC Commissioner""Really it's about you all as community leaders. I can sing from the highest perch, ‘we need to sign folks up for free Internet,' but it's really those community relationships,"" said Commissioner Starks. ""It's really, especially back to your question about communities of color - the trusted community member and organization telling a fellow neighbor, ‘you know about this program, right?'""The issue of trust emerged as a common thread through several conversations today, including our Spotlight on Connectivity panel, during which I spoke with three community leaders from across the country, including one right here in Philadelphia.All three of these amazing organizations center their digital equity efforts on providing comprehensive and compassionate assistance to the folks they serve-and meeting people where they are.Julia Fearing, a resident services manager for the Detroit Housing Commission, said one thing in particular about the residents she serves in Detroit that is so important for all of us to consider as we move forward.""You can talk all day and you can have a pretty face all day, right? But guess what, are you going to follow through? That's a big key component in our communities. Because they lack trust with anybody,"" said Fearing. ""A lot of people have past traumas and we know that. So we try to help assist them as much as possible, and that's how we can incorporate ACP, because now they trust me.""Thoai Nguyen, CEO of the Southeast Asian Mutual Assistance Association Coalition added later that, ""As we're migrating some of the most basic, fundamental needs of all of us toward the digital space, not having access to it is not the end of the world, but it's going to limit your possibilities.""Dorri McWhorter, the President &amp; CEO of the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago, drove home why tailoring to specific needs of communities is the key to success.""Because in 2022 our services are so comprehensive - we're literally serving babies to seniors, one of the things that's important for us is, whoever that digital navigator is in that space has to understand what that community needs and how to approach that community,"" McWhorter said of meeting the needs of over 25 YMCA sites she oversees.Comcast is doubling the upload speed of Internet Essentials Plus serviceFinally, I was so pleased to use the summit to announce that Comcast is doubling the upload speed of Internet Essentials Plus service, our signature low-cost offering for eligible families. This will enable our subscribers, many of whom receive the service for no cost thanks to the Affordable Connectivity Program, to do even more of what they love online.We have never been better positioned to make our digital economy work for everyone in America. My biggest takeaway from the Project UP Partner Summit today is excitement for the future. All of us are working toward a single goal of achieving digital equity - however that may manifest itself in our various communities. Together, let's finish the job.Broderick Johnson is Executive Vice President, Public Policy and Executive Vice President, Digital Equity for Comcast Corporation.Project UP is Comcast's comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity and help build a future of unlimited possibilities.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: http://www.comcastcorporation.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722833/Championing-Digital-Equity-A-Story-of-Partnership]"

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. Macroeconomic concerns affected the fund’s quarterly performance and it declined by 2.2%, in line with the benchmark indexes. However, the fund outperformed its benchmark indexes by 7% annually since inception in 2017. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2022.Alluvial Capital discussed stocks like P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) in the Q3 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) provides multi-asset class private market solutions. On October 27, 2022, P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) stock closed at $10.62 per share. One-month return of P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) was 0.95% and its shares lost 15.04% of their value over the last 52 weeks. P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) has a market capitalization of $1.245 billion.Alluvial Capital made the following comment about P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Alluvial’s largest holding remains P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX), owner of a diversified set of alternative assets managers. Second quarter earnings were strong and saw continued organic growth in assets under management. Shortly following the earnings report, P10 announced an acquisition that will grow assets under management and be accretive to free cash flow per share, in a deal that closed just days ago in mid-October.P10 has purchased Western Technology Investment, a manager of venture debt funds. Founded in 1980, WTI has provided nearly $8 billion in debt commitments to venture companies largely in the technology and life sciences sectors. Building on this track record, WTI is expected to launch a new fund in 2024. P10 purchased Western Technology Investment for $97 million in cash plus the equivalent of $40 million in P10 stock, representing a multiple of 11x WTI’s pre-tax cash flow. The deal also includes an earn-out provision if WTI’s earnings achieve certain thresholds.This transaction will benefit P10 by growing fee-paying assets under management to at least $19.9 billion, as well as increasing both the average fee rate on and average duration of assets under management, resulting in annualized revenues climbing to $200 million. Given these improvements, adjusted for the additional debt and higher interest rates, I now estimate P10’s annualized free cash flow at 84 cents per share. If WTI hits the high end of its earn-out range, that free cash flow would increase to 91 cents per share. Currently priced around $10.30, P10 shares change hands for just 12.3x forward-looking free cash flow, less if the WTI investment works out well.

(MU) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-inc-mu-trending-130001312.html,1666962001,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +4.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -98.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -109.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.18 points to a change of -97.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -106.8%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.53 indicates a change of +1,859.9% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -40.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.29 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -44.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.43 billion and $26.7 billion estimates indicate -36.8% and +37.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $6.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.7%. EPS of $1.45 for the same period compares with $2.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.03%. The EPS surprise was +3.57%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Nasdaq: MU), and the Micron Foundation, along with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, have announced a new partnership with the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), committing to a joint investment of $10 million to fund and develop semiconductor curricula in colleges and universities across the country.NSF will match the Micron Foundation’s initial donation of $5 million over the next five years, enabling the development of high-quality educational material, offering educators options for professional development and providing students with experiential opportunities in the semiconductor industry. Micron and NSF will work together to direct the funds towards these programs and towards innovative academic research in the high technology memory field.Broadening access to and strengthening the quality of semiconductor instruction in U.S. higher education institutions will help to expand and diversify not only America’s semiconductor industry, but also the workforce of the future.“This new cross-sector partnership will help American innovation keep pace with a changing global innovation landscape,” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “The historic passage of the ""CHIPS and Science Act,"" is allowing NSF to help keep American technology innovation on the cutting edge and ensure cutting-edge industries are made in America.”“Working together, the business community, academia and the public sector can create new pathways to careers for students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds,” said April Arnzen, Micron’s chief people officer and president of the Micron Foundation. “We’re looking forward to growing our partnership with NSF and reaching students across America – whether they’re enrolled at a minority-serving institution, research university or community college – as they advance America’s technological leadership and scientific innovation.”Story continues“When I wrote my Endless Frontier Act which eventually became the CHIPS and Science bill, it was innovative partnerships between companies like Micron and the National Science Foundation that I had top of mind,” said Senator Schumer. “We are bringing together the best and the brightest, and programs like this are how we breathe new life into our nation’s manufacturing future and prepare the next generation with the skills and education they need to take us into tomorrow. This investment will help ensure America remains on the cutting-edge of new innovations and that our workforce is ready for the good-paying jobs building our future in the communities that need them most, including Upstate NY, and I am proud to have paved the way to make it happen.”Micron’s NSF partnership closely follows Micron’s recently announced historic $500 million investment, in partnership with the state of New York, in community and workforce development. Aimed at expanding and preparing Central New York’s workforce for Micron’s new leading-edge memory megafab, which will be built in Clay, New York, the fund will be used for workforce training, education programs, housing and other community investments. Micron aims to hire a diverse workforce in the region, and to accelerate economic opportunity for underserved communities in the semiconductor industry.About Micron and Micron FoundationWe are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.

(NASDAQ:HAS) For Its Next Dividend Without Doing These Checks",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-buy-hasbro-inc-nasdaq-124316856.html,1666960996,STORY,['HAS'],"[Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next two days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Hasbro's shares on or after the 31st of October, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 15th of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.70 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.80 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Hasbro has a trailing yield of 4.3% on the current share price of $65.11. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Hasbro has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Hasbro If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Last year Hasbro paid out 93% of its profits as dividends to shareholders, suggesting the dividend is not well covered by earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Hasbro paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 167%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. We're curious about why the company paid out more cash than it generated last year, since this can be one of the early signs that a dividend may be unsustainable.As Hasbro's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Hasbro's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 7.4% a year over the previous five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Hasbro has delivered an average of 8.8% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Hasbro is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.Final TakeawayHas Hasbro got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? It's looking like an unattractive opportunity, with its earnings per share declining, while, paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of both its profits (93%) and cash flow as dividends. This is a starkly negative combination that often suggests a dividend cut could be in the company's near future. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Hasbro.With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Hasbro don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business.

YUM is scheduled to report its third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.8%.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.14, indicating a decline of 6.6% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $1.64 billion, suggesting growth of 2% from $1.61 billion in the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteYum! Brands’ third-quarter 2022 performance is likely to have benefited from robust same-store sales growth, expansion efforts and strong off-premise ordering channels. We expect KFC, Taco Bell and Habit Burger Grill comps to grow 1.4%, 4% and 2%, respectively.  The company’s sales have continued to benefit from improvement in the nutritional value of its menu items, coupled with its distinctive plant-based offerings (such as KFC's Beyond Fried Chicken in the United States and Pizza Hut’s Beyond Italian Sausage Crumbles in Canada).Our estimate showcases an increase of 0.6% to $696.2 million in the KFC segment and a gain of 4.4% to $258 million in the Pizza Hut segment for the quarter under discussion. We expect Taco Bell and Habit Burger Grill revenues to increase 4.4% and 3% year over year to $557.5 million and $137 million, respectively.However, rising inflation levels are likely to have impacted margins in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect the adjusted operating margin in the quarter to be 31.8% compared with 32.3% reported in the prior-year quarter. An increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance, and other operating costs, such as rent and energy costs, put significant pressure on the company’s margins.Yum Brands, Inc.

Ray Kroc made his fortune on that assumption. He ran with it, wrestling the company (depending on who is telling the story) away from the original founders, the McDonald brothers in San Bernardino, CA. Even former McDonald’s CFO Harry J. Sonneborn, who died in 1992, publicly validated the strategy, which had become its worst-kept secret. Sonneborn was quoted as saying, “We are not technically in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell fifteen-cent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue, from which our tenants can pay us our rent.”McDonald’s Made Huge Purchases At The Turn Of The Century In the late 1990s and early 2000s, McDonald’s went on a buying spree to increase its real estate holdings, scooping up locations of food establishments such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) because of the land they were on.The company eventually sold between 2000 and 2008, in part because of the recession. But in that recession, McDonald’s also jumped on rapidly declining property values by buying even more of the land where its restaurants reside. The company now owns almost half of its restaurant land and 75% of its buildings, with the remainder being leased.So Is McDonald’s Still A Good Buy?But is McDonald’s still an excellent real estate investment stock? For one thing, with all the stores and real estate it currently owns, the company lost only 240 locations last year, representing a default rate of 0.6%. Those numbers would attract anyone wanting to invest in a particular REIT. Will McDonald’s ever spin off into a REIT? Based on the prime locations of many of its restaurants, investors are drooling at the potential. But financial experts don’t think it will happen soon because its landlord income is too lucrative.Story continuesFrom its operations, McDonald’s pulled off something few have done. It raised prices and profits at the same time. The company reported third-quarter 2022 revenue of $5.87 billion, which exceeded Wall Street expectations of $5.69 billion. McDonald’s reported earnings per share were $2.68. In October, the restaurant chain is projecting U.S. same-store sales growth in the low double digits.The company’s performance is just another factor making McDonald’s stock a more-than-reliable real estate investment whose numbers appear poised to keep producing positive shareholder value and returns for decades to come.And for many investors, putting money into McDonald’s stock has been the 1990 blue-chip equivalent of Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) However, because investors have recently flocked to the stock’s relatively more secure investment case, some are worried McDonald’s valuation has reached elevated levels. But with a price-to-earnings ratio of 25 and a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of about 27, representing a nearly five-year average, few indications show that the McDonald’s restaurant and real estate model is in danger of decline.Photo byThabang onUnsplashAlternative investment insights from BenzingaRentberry, the startup that’s disrupting the residential rental market, has extended its funding round on StartEngine another week.

The median expected year-ahead inflation rate rose to 5.1% from 4.7%, with increases reported across age, income, and education. Also, long-run inflation expectations increased to 2.9% from 2.7%.Rising consumer confidence bodes well for household spending in the coming months and is expected to have a positive impact on the consumer discretionary sector, which attracts a major portion of consumer spending.According to Wells Fargo, consumers had accumulated as much as $2.1 trillion in excess savings during the peak of the pandemic helped by fiscal support and lack of spending options amid lockdowns. That’s a huge sum in an economy with $25 trillion in annual GDP. Though these savings are rapidly declining amid high inflation, consumers still have $1.3 trillion in extra spending power as of August, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.“Excess savings currently total around 14% of a year’s spending, with almost all saved in bank accounts and other liquid assets,” Joseph Briggs, an economist for Goldman Sachs, observed in a research note published lately, as quoted on tker.co.U.S. consumers have demonstrated a willingness to continue to pay higher prices despite a sluggish economy that even has a chance to enter into a recession, according to credit card giants American Express and Bank of America, as quoted on CNBC.American Express recently reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue, while raising its full-year forecast. The company said overall customer spending rose 21% year over year, driven by growth in goods and services as well as travel and entertainment.Story continuesBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also said recently that the bank’s customers continue to spend spontaneously, using their credit cards and other payment methods for 10% more transaction volume in September and the first half of October than a year earlier, as indicated on a CNBC article.Moreover, one can bet on consumer-discretionary stocks now as the late October-December period embraces the key holiday season, which puts the spotlight on the performance of retailers. As loads of sales-boosting events — Halloween, Thanksgiving, Cyber Monday, Black Friday and Christmas — fall in this quartile, the sector generally sees a sales boost.Mastercard SpendingPulse says U.S. retail sales are expected to rise non-inflation adjusted 7.1% year over year (up 8.5% versus 2021) for the holiday season, excluding autos and gas. As a result, the consumer discretionary sector has every chance to outperform in Q4. If this was not enough, the Fed may slower its rate hike momentum from December.Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few consumer ETFs that could gain ahead.ETFs in FocusVanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR) – Zacks Rank #2The underlying MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Discretionary 25/50 Index is designed to transition in and out of securities affected by pending updates to the consumer discretionary sector.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for NetApp What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$39bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$39b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$18bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$30b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$69.4, the company appears quite good value at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NetApp as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.257. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For NetApp, we've put together three important aspects you should further research:Risks: Take risks, for example - NetApp has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does NTAP's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on ResMed's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for ResMed How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ResMed is:23% = US$779m ÷ US$3.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.23 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.ResMed's Earnings Growth And 23% ROETo begin with, ResMed has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, ResMed was able to see a decent net income growth of 16% over the last five years.We then performed a comparison between ResMed's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 18% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is RMD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether RMD is currently mispriced by the market.Is ResMed Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?ResMed has a three-year median payout ratio of 46%, which implies that it retains the remaining 54% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Besides, ResMed has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 26% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that ResMed's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) insiders",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-12m-worth-stock-110034460.html,1667041234,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Even though Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) stock gained 7.6% last week, insiders who sold US$12m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$63.66, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International Mondelez International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Fredric Reynolds, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.7m worth of shares at a price of US$63.29 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$61.70. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).All up, insiders sold more shares in Mondelez International than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Mondelez International better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of Mondelez InternationalI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Mondelez International insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$101m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Mondelez International Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Mondelez International shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Mondelez International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Mondelez International has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

But he still loves 1 specific sectorDespite the stock market’s recent bounce, some experts are in no mood to celebrate.According to top fund manager Jeff Muhlenkamp, the outlook remains gloomy.In an interview with Business Insider, Muhlenkamp says that the S&amp;P 500 could drop another 20% to 25%.He says that the Fed — which is raising interest rates aggressively to tame inflation — has “broken a couple of things already.”“Frankly, I have no reason to expect anything other than more breakage. I honestly don't think the Fed's going to get inflation under control before something that they really care about goes haywire.”Don't missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income every quarter)This surprising asset class is up 14%. Here's how to bolster your portfolio with a shockproof alternative investmentMuhlenkamp knows a thing or two about surviving the current downturn. His Muhlenkamp Fund has beaten 99% of its peers year to date according to investment research specialist Morningstar.While the fund manager is not bullish on the market as a whole, he still sees opportunity in a sector that has already performed quite well.“Right now, unfortunately, we aren't seeing great prices that trump our concerns about what's happening at the national economic level, with the one exception being in energy.”Here are three of his favorite names in the space.EQT (EQT)EQT is a natural gas producer in the Marcellus and Utica Shales in the Appalachian Basin.Given how much natural gas prices have gone up this year, it’s no surprise that EQT’s business is firing on all cylinders.The company just reported earnings. In Q3, it achieved an average realized price of $3.41 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent, marking a 46% increase from the $2.33 per Mcfe it earned in the year-ago period.EQT also churned out $591 million of free cash flow for the quarter, a huge improvement from the $99 million generated in Q3 2021.Story continuesUnsurprisingly, the company has received a lot of investor attention this year — shares are up 80% so far in 2022.EQT is also returning more cash to investors. Management recently doubled the company’s share repurchase authorization to $2.0 billion.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Occidental Petroleum is an energy company with assets in the U.S., the Middle East and North Africa. Notably, it’s one of the leading oil producers in the Permian and DJ basins and offshore Gulf of Mexico.Occidental made headlines earlier this year when legendary investor Warren Buffett loaded up on the company’s shares.Read more: The US now has just 25 days of diesel supply — the lowest since 2008. Here's why that's more alarming than a dwindling 'oil piggy bank'Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway backed up the truck on Occidental after the company’s earnings conference call held in late February. Buffett read the transcript and liked what he saw.“We started buying on Monday and we bought all we could,” he told CNBC.Later on, Buffett bought more — a lot more.According to the latest SEC filing, Berkshire now owns 194.4 million shares of OXY, worth a whopping $14.1 billion. That makes OXY Buffett’s sixth-largest holding.The stock has surged 135% year to date, which is impressive — even by energy sector standards.Occidental will release its Q3 earnings report on Nov. 8 after the closing bell.SLB (SLB)It’s not just the producers that can benefit from the energy boom. Muhlenkamp also holds shares of oilfield services provider SLB.In Q3, SLB brought in $7.5 billion of revenue, representing a 28% increase year over year.Bottom line growth was even more impressive, as the company’s adjusted earnings came in at $0.63 per share, up 26% sequentially and 75% from a year ago.Shares have climbed a solid 63% year to date.Note, that SLB used to go by the name Schlumberger.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Scientific Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.19bUS$2.41bUS$2.49bUS$2.71bUS$2.85bUS$2.97bUS$3.07bUS$3.17bUS$3.26bUS$3.34bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.22%Est @ 4.25%Est @ 3.57%Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.0%) = US$76bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$76b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$40bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$60b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$43.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boston Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.964. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Boston Scientific, we've compiled three pertinent factors you should look at:Risks: Take risks, for example - Boston Scientific has   4 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for BSX's future outlook?

Earnings of $4.20 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.03. The bottom line also plunged 38% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for earnings was $5.12.Results were adversely impacted by higher provisions for credit losses on the worsening macroeconomic environment and recessionary fears. Also, an increase in operating expenses acted as a headwind.Yet, a robust improvement in loan balances and higher interest rates aided net interest income (NII). Further decent consumer sentiments supported the credit card business and non-interest income.Net income available to common shareholders was $1.62 billion, plunging 46% from the prior-year quarter.Revenues &amp; Expenses RiseTotal net revenues were $8.81 billion, up 12% from the prior-year quarter. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.60 billion. We had projected revenues to be $8.52 billion.NII improved 14% from the prior-year quarter to $7 billion. Net interest margin (NIM) surged 45 basis points (bps) to 6.80%. This was largely driven by lower average cash and securities balances and higher yields on average interest-earning assets. Our estimates for NII and NIM were $6.67 billion and 6.69%, respectively.Non-interest income of $1.8 billion rose 8%. This was primarily attributable to growth in net interchange fees (up 17%) and service charges and other customer-related fees (up 2%). On the other hand, other non-interest income declined 22%. Our estimate for the metric was pegged at $1.85 billion.Non-interest expenses were $4.95 billion, rising 18%. The increase was mainly due to a 32% surge in professional services and a 30% rise in marketing costs. We had expected this metric to be $4.94 billion.Efficiency ratio was 56.21%, up from 53.46% in the year-ago quarter. A rise in efficiency ratio indicates a deterioration in profitability.As of Sep 30, 2022, loans held for investment were $303.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter. Total deposits, as of the same date, also grew 3% to $317.2 billion.Story continuesCredit Quality WorsensProvision for credit losses was $1.67 billion in the reported quarter against a provision benefit of $342 million in the prior-year quarter. We had anticipated the metric to be $1.07 billion.The 30-plus day performing delinquency rate rose 61 bps to 2.58%. Also, the net charge-off rate jumped 57 bps year over year to 1.24%.However, allowance, as a percentage of reported loans held for investment, was 4.02%, down 41 bps.Capital &amp; Profitability Ratios DeterioratesAs of Sep 30, 2022, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.6%, down from 15.7% a year ago. Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.2% as of Sep 30, 2022, down from 13.8%.At the end of the third quarter, return on average assets was 1.52%, down from the year-ago period’s 2.92%. Return on average common equity was 13.01%, down from 20.52%.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the quarter, Capital One repurchased 2.9 million shares for $313 million.Our ViewCapital One’s strategic acquisitions, rise in demand for consumer loans, higher rates and steady improvement in the card business position it well for long-term growth.

The bottom line reflects a decline of 48.1% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for earnings was $1.75.Results were primarily hurt by a rise in expenses, a decline in other revenues and higher provisions. However, an improvement in net financing revenues was an offsetting factor.

The adjusted earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.69. Strong cystic fibrosis (“CF”) product revenues during the quarter, which was partially offset by higher research and development expenses, boosted earnings.Revenues of $2.33 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.23 billion, comprised fully of CF product revenues. Total product revenues rose 18% year over year, primarily driven by higher international sales of Trikafta (marketed as Kaftrio in Europe).Quarter in DetailThe company markets four CF products — Trikafta/Kaftrio, Symdeko (marketed as Symkevi in Europe), Orkambi and Kalydeco.CF product sales rose 5% year over year in the United States to $1.46 billion, while sales outside the United States surged 46% to $879 million.Trikafta generated sales worth $2.01 billion, up 29.2% year over year, driven by strong uptakes in international markets and additional patients starting treatment with Trikafta, most notably pediatric patients (6-11 years of age) in the United States. Trikafta sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93 billion.Symdeko/Symkevi registered sales of $38 million in the quarter, down 53.1% year over year.Kalydeco recorded sales of $139 million in the quarter, down 14.2% year over year. Orkambi generated sales of $146 million in the reported quarter, down 21.1% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. Sales of Kalydeco, Symdeko/ Symkevi and Orkambi were hurt by patients switching to Trikafta.Costs RiseAdjusted operating expense was $758 million in the quarter, up 29% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. This rise in the expense was made by the company to support the clinical development of its pipeline candidates as well as increased costs incurred by management to support the company’s product launches.Adjusted research and development (R&amp;D) expenses rose 36.2% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $549 million due to the expanding mid- and late-stage pipeline.Story continuesAdjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased 13.9% to $180 million in the reported quarter due to expenses for CF launches and pre-commercial activities for exa-cel.During the third quarter, Vertex recorded acquired IPR&amp;D costs of $29 million compared with $27 million in the year-ago quarter.Ups 2022 GuidanceThe company raised its previously-issued product sales guidance for 2022 from $8.6-$8.8 billion to $8.8-$8.9 billion, backed by robust sales of Kaftrio/Trikafta in international markets and a steady performance in the United States. The updated guidance represents product revenue growth of approximately 17% at the midpoint. Shares rose 4.8% in after-market trading on Oct 27, most likely on this increased sales guidance.This year so far, shares of Vertex have surged 31.1% against the industry’s 23.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCombined adjusted R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense guidance for 2022 was maintained in the range of $3.0-$3.1 billion. The adjusted tax rate is expected in the range of 21-22%.Pipeline &amp; Other UpdatesThough Vertex is a market leader in the CF space, the company is rapidly advancing its pipeline consisting of rapidly advancing mid- and late-stage clinical non-CF pipelines across six disease areas. Vertex stated that programs in five disease areas are entering or progressing through late-stage clinical development.Vertex is co-developing a gene-editing treatment, exa-cel (formerly CTX001), in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP in two devastating diseases — in transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD). CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex are evaluating exa-cel in two ongoing phase I/II/III studies in SCD and TDT indications.Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics are also preparing to start a rolling review submission with the FDA for exa-cel in the indications by November 2022. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics have already completed discussions on exa-cel for both SCD and TDT indications with the regulatory authorities in Europe. The companies intend to submit the regulatory filings by this year’s end. Vertex expects exa-cel to be its next commercial launch.Alongside its earnings release, Vertex also announced initiated the pivotal phase III study evaluating its non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitor VX-548, as a potential treatment for moderate to severe acute pain following bunionectomy or abdominoplasty surgery. A phase II dose-ranging study of VX-548 in neuropathic pain is expected to be initiated by the end of this year.Inaxaplin (formerly VX-147) is being developed in a single pivotal phase II/III study in patients with APOL1-mediated kidney disease, or AMKD with two APOL1 mutations and proteinuric kidney disease. Enrollment is ongoing, with more than 30 sites active in the United States.Vertex says that exa-cel, inaxaplin and VX-548 all represent multibillion-dollar opportunities.The company also completed the acquisition of ViaCyte last month. Prior to the acquisition, Vertex partnered with ViaCyte to develop VX-880, an investigational stem cell-derived fully differentiated islet cell replacement therapy to treat type I diabetes (T1D) with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia.VRTX has also initiated a first-in-human clinical study on VX-634, a small molecule AAT corrector in healthy volunteers. Vertex will also begin a 48-week phase II study of VX-864, its first-generation AAT corrector, in a few weeks to evaluate if longer-term treatment with VX-864 can result in polymer clearance from the liver and lead to greater increases in functional AAT levels in the plasma.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:41% = US$10.0b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.41 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Coca-Cola has a superior ROE than the average (15%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Coca-Cola's Debt And Its 41% Return On EquityCoca-Cola clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.69. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

MHK reported mixed results for third-quarter 2022. Earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined on a year-over-year basis. Net sales missed the analysts’ and management’s expectations but increased year over year in a low-single digit.MHK’s shares slipped 3.41% in the after-hours trading session on Oct 27.Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum, chairman and CEO of Mohawk, said, “The U.S. is being impacted by high overall inflation and mortgage rates that have risen from below 3% to approximately 7%. The residential market, which is the most significant part of our business, is expected to decline further before we see an inflection point. Remodeling has slowed, and our product mix has been impacted as consumers trade down to options that fit their budgets. It is estimated that the U.S. has a housing deficit of five million units, and more than half of U.S. homes are over 50 years old. Remodeling investments are expected to grow long term as U.S. housing stock ages and families with low mortgage rates choose to remain in their homes.”Inside the NumbersMohawk reported adjusted earnings of $3.34 per share, meeting the consensus mark and declining 15.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $3.95. The downtrend was due to lower volume, which resulted in higher unabsorbed costs and material, energy and transportation inflation. Its Europian business suffered from the unprecedented energy crisis and high inflation.Mohawk Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Mohawk Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMohawk Industries, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Mohawk Industries, Inc. Quote Net sales of $2.92 billion also lagged the consensus estimate of $3.06 billion by 4.6% but increased 3.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $2.82 billion. On a constant-currency basis, net sales were up 8.3% year over year. The upside was driven by price increases and strength in the commercial sector. However, net sales were below the company’s expectation due to the retail channel, which softened across all regions and product categories and a 4.1% impact from currency.Story continuesOperating HighlightsAdjusted gross profit of $745.5 million was down 11% year over year. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses — as a percentage of net sales — increased 60 basis points from the year-ago period’s levels to 16.3%. Adjusted operating income totaled $271.1 million, down almost 25% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA was $412.4 million.Segment DetailsGlobal Ceramic: Sales in the segment totaled $1.1 billion, up 9.8% year over year. Also, the metric rose 12.4% on a constant-currency basis. Strength in the new home construction channel in most geographies and the commercial channel benefited the segment’s top line. Adjusted operating income increased to $132.2 million from $119.1 million a year ago. The segment’s adjusted operating margin was 12.1%.Flooring North America: Net sales at the segment amounted to $1.09 billion, increasing 3.7% year over year on a reported basis. The upside was driven by strong pricing, with hard surface products outperforming due to the investments in premium laminate and LVT partially offset by lower manufacturing volumes. The segment registered an adjusted operating income of $87.7 million in the quarter, down from $120 million reported in the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin was 8% in the quarter.Flooring Rest of the World: Net sales in the segment decreased 4.7% year over year to $0.73 billion. On a constant-currency basis, sales were up 9.4% from the year-ago level, backed by price increases and growth in the panels, insulation and Oceania businesses. Yet, constrained consumer spending in the residential market and softness in the retail sector impacted the same. Adjusted operating income was $62.3 million, down from $133.3 million reported a year ago. The segment’s adjusted operating margin was 8.5% due to inflation, lower sales volume and reduced production.Financial HighlightsMohawk currently has available liquidity of more than $1.8 billion. As of Oct 1, 2022, Mohawk had cash and cash equivalents of $326.97 million compared with $268.9 million at 2021-end. Long-term debt — less current portion — at the third-quarter end was $1.02 billion compared with $1.72 billion at 2021-end.For the third quarter, the company generated a free cash flow of $74.7 million, significantly down from $351 million a year ago.Fourth-Quarter ViewHigher interest rates have been moderating demand for homes, thereby impacting housing sales. Also, inflation is causing changes in consumer discretionary spending. Meanwhile, residential remodeling is softening as consumers have been deferring their home improvement projects. In Europe, gas and electricity prices are reducing demand and increasing manufacturing and material costs. Given these factors, MHK anticipates demand to slow in the fourth quarter and reduced production to result in greater unabsorbed overhead.Second-quarter U.S. pricing announcement led to an increase in carpet material costs significantly that will compress margins until they flow through the inventory. Mohawk anticipates fourth-quarter adjusted EPS to be $1.40-$1.50, excluding any restructuring charges, down from $2.95 reported in fourth-quarter 2021.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Consumer Discretionary ReleasesMohawk currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mattel, Inc.

The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%.The third-quarter revenues compare to our estimate of $2.97 billion.Management noted that the top line was primarily driven by increased hospital inpatient dialysis revenues and continued migration to Medicare Advantage plans. However, the quarterly revenues were negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in government rates due to the reinstatement of 2% Medicare sequestration as of Jul 1 and a decrease in the commercial mix.Segment DetailsThe company’s dialysis patient service revenues were $2.85 billion, up by 0.3% year over year.

This represents a per-day decrease of 0.4% on a sequential basis.As of Sep 30, 2022, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 243,800 patients at 3,128 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,776 were U.S. centers while 352 were located across 11 other countries.During the third quarter of 2022, the company acquired five dialysis centers, opened a total of six new dialysis centers and closed 44 dialysis centers in the United States.

QuoteStory continuesMargin DetailsIn the quarter under review, DaVita’s gross profit fell 7.2% to $863.1 million. Gross margin contracted 237 basis points (bps) to 29.3%.We had projected 29.2% of gross margin for Q3.General &amp; administrative expenses climbed 24.7% to $365.4 million.Adjusted operating profit totaled $497.7 million, reflecting 21.8% plunge from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter contracted 479 bps to 16.9%.The adjusted operating margin according to our model was 12.8% for Q3.Financial PositionDaVita exited third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $441.8 million compared with $363.1 million at the end of the second quarter. Total debt (including the current portion) at the end of third-quarter 2022 was $9.08 billion, compared with $9.26 billion at the end of the second quarter.The cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of third-quarter 2022 was $1.22 billion.DaVita repurchased 2.1 million shares of its common stock for $185 million during the reported quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $7.64.Our TakeDaVita ended the third quarter of 2021 with lower-than-expected results. The dismal overall bottom-line result is disappointing. A fall in the company’s total U.S. dialysis treatments during the third quarter is concerning. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well for the company. DaVita lowered its full-year adjusted EPS outlook, which further raises apprehension. The company faced negative volume trends due to COVID and continued labor pressure during the reported quarter, which is further concerning.However, uptick in the company’s overall top line and both its segments’ revenue during the period is impressive. The acquisition of several dialysis centers and the opening of others, both within the United States and overseas, are also encouraging. The increased hospital inpatient dialysis revenues registered during the third quarter are also promising.Zacks Rank and Key PicksDaVita currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Elevance Health Inc.

This compares to earnings of $2.36 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -12.12%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this kidney dialysis provider would post earnings of $2.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.30, delivering a surprise of 9%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.DaVita HealthCare , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry, posted revenues of $2.95 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.08%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.94 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.DaVita HealthCare shares have lost about 15% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.1%.What's Next for DaVita HealthCare?While DaVita HealthCare has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for DaVita HealthCare: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

If you want to skip our industry background and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Best Home Appliances Stocks to Buy. Out of the countless industries that anyone can pick out from when choosing a sector to invest in, the home appliance sector is one that is not subject to drastic shifts in demand. Of course, while consumer spending powers and some seasonality due to the weather plays a role in determining demand, overall, the sector continues to perform simply because technology enables companies to churn out new gadgets that make living much easier and at lower costs.Therefore, it is no surprise that home appliance companies are among some of the biggest in the world, with the sector having given us some modern day behemoths such as Samsung and Panasonic. The industry itself was worth $308 billion last year, and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 7% from 2021 to 2025 to sit at $436 billion according to a report from The Business Research Company. Driving this growth will be a host of factors such as the growing market for outdoor parties, LED lights to minimize power consumption, and newer designs, believes the research firm.Just as is the case with nearly every other industry, the home appliance segment is also benefiting from the boom in technology. This has resulted in the growth of new gadgets that are dubbed as 'smart' home appliances, and a report from KBV research zeroes in on this segment to estimate that it alone will grow at a much stronger CAGR of 8.7% until 2028. This growth will place its value at $50 billion by the end of the forecast period. Smart home appliances offer their users a variety of features, such as controlling their features remotely over the Internet through smartphones, use self learning capabilities to adjust themselves to the user's schedule, and providing better energy management as well - with the latter being a crucial point considering the recent energy shortages that are plaguing global economies in the wake of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.Story continuesIn this piece, we sifted out the top home appliance stocks in the market right now, with the notable picks being Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.

301,38bbdb71-3f71-350c-ba53-dd6d7eddaca0,LYB,2022-10-29,Top 10 Chemical Companies in the World in 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-chemical-companies-world-194602287.html,1666986362,STORY,"['LIN', 'LYB']","[In this article we are going to list the top 10 chemical companies in the world in 2022. Click to skip ahead and jump to the top 5 chemical companies in the world in 2022.The global chemical industry has staged a remarkable comeback after the pandemic occurred, being one of the few industries to actually grow versus 2019, the last ""normal"" year, with BASF's report expecting it to grow by 10% vs 2019. The growth rate in 2021 was an incredible 6.1%, though that was mostly facilitated because of the massive decline in 2020 after the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world and most industries came to a standstill. The growth rate has normalized in 2022, and is expected to be around 3.5%, which is in line with what the industry growth rate was before the pandemic.In the United States, the chemical industry has also grown significantly in the past couple of years, mainly due to a strong demand for both commodity and specialty chemicals, which has allowed for higher prices throughout the year. Further, the biggest players in the industry, some of whom are among the top chemical companies in the world in 2022, have started to build their capacity and embark on higher capital expenditure, in order to enter more markets, either organically or inorganically. However, the industry does have to battle rising costs as inflation has gripped not just the United States, but the world, which is affecting margins, with companies trying to reduce costs elsewhere or simply raising prices.Adam Gregor/Shutterstock.comOne of the most important areas that chemical industries are focusing on now is sustainability and decarbonization. Most companies have either already started to increase research and development costs, or are in the process of doing so, to lower their carbon footprint as the fight against climate change is taking center stage for most companies and how they're fighting the most important battle of our time. How these countries fight climate change affects potential customers' perception and willingness to deal with such companies, which is why chemical companies, who are often responsible for major toxic waste, are now taking this seriously.Story continuesWhile volatility is at an all-time high because of the pandemic, inflation and the pending threat of a recession, chemical companies are trying to fight this mainly by transforming their asset portfolios. The pandemic resulted in demand for specialty materials and plastics diverging, primarily because of petrochemical expansion in the US Gulf Coast. Further, the biggest chemical companies in the world have also embraced digitization, especially in terms of advanced data analytics in addition to potential advances in cognitive computing and sensors.Another change taking place in the chemical industry is that it is becoming more customer centric, which is required for customer retention and customer loyalty. The pandemic may have accelerated the change but trends have been more customer driven for a while now, especially with more options to switch to.China is the biggest chemical market in the world, and is expected to see continued growth of around 4%, despite demand from both electronics and consumer goods industries weakening, while it is still growing in the automotive industry, which is a major customer in China for chemicals. Despite slightly weakening growth, China's chemical industry growth rate still outpaces most of the major players in Emerging Markets. Compare this to the European Union, where expected growth is just 2.8%, despite a major rebound in demand expected from the automotive industry. The main reason behind the lower growth rate is that production had already started to slow down in 2021, with the United Kingdom expecting a growth rate of just 2.0%.To rank the biggest chemical companies in the world in 2022, we consulted Fortune Global 500. We extracted the top 15 companies from the list and considered their revenue, profits, assets and number of employees. We then assigned 60% weight to revenue, 20% to profits and 10% each to assets and number of employees to come up with our more balanced rankings. You may also be interested in comparing our list to the 15 largest chemical companies in the world in 2020 which was based on metrics before the pandemic. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the giants of the chemical industry, starting with number 15:10.

However, an active catastrophe environment is likely to have acted as a drag on the margins for insurers. Some of the insurance companies like Aflac Incorporated AFL, Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF, CNA Financial Corporation CNA and CNO Financial Group, Inc. CNO are set to report their respective third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 31.The insurance space is housed within the broader Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). The latest Earnings Preview indicates that the total earnings of finance companies for third-quarter 2022 are projected to decline 7.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure, while revenues of these companies are expected to improve 3.8%.Factors Likely to Decide the Fate of Insurance Stocks in Q3Premiums, one of the most significant contributors to an insurer’s top line, are likely to have gained from an improved pricing environment, exposure growth and solid customer retention rates in the third quarter. Though an active catastrophe environment comes with its own share of worries, the same usually accelerates the policy renewal rate and prompts insurers to implement rate hikes for seamless claim payments. Diversified portfolios, which minimize concentration risks, are also likely to have acted as catalysts for insurers’ third-quarter premiums.Per the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index, insurance pricing across the United States improved 5% in the to-be-reported quarter. Property insurance pricing rose 8% in the third quarter, marking the 20th straight quarter of price increases in the business line.An economy recovering from the ill effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have resumed commercial and industrial activities, which in turn, might have generated higher premiums in the to-be-reported quarter following solid demand for workers’ compensation insurance. Story continuesHowever, the underwriting results of insurers with exposure to property and casualty (P&amp;C) line of business might have taken a hit from catastrophe losses stemming from Hurricane Ian. Swiss Re expects the deadly storm to produce a preliminary total insured market loss in the range of $50-$65 billion. Nevertheless, reinsurance covers and a favorable reserve development might have kept the insurers ready to counter catastrophe losses and shield their underwriting results.An improving interest rate scenario is expected to have boosted investment yields in the third quarter of those insurers with exposure to rate-sensitive products. Lower mortality rates resulting from the receding effects of the pandemic are likely to have declined claim payments by life insurers. This, in turn, is expected to have driven their underwriting results and subsequently, improved the combined ratio in the to-be-reported quarter.The insurance industry pursues significant technology investments in blockchain, AI and advanced analytics to ramp up claim payments and automate processes. These investments are likely to have saved costs and aided insurers’ margins in the third quarter.   Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed before their third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 31.The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

However, operations in its Japan segment are likely to have been affected by a lower interest rate environment. On a hopeful note, AFL’s expenses are likely to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter, thanks to its multiple cost-curbing efforts. This might have driven its margins. (Read more: Can Declining Premiums Affect Aflac's Q3 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aflac’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.22 indicates a decline of 20.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety. Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers. These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed has already made five hikes in 2022 with more to come. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. They implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Per Marsh, global commercial insurance prices in the third quarter of 2022 increased 16%, marking the 20th straight quarter of price increase. However, Marsh also stated that the magnitude has declined in the last seven quarters. Per Willis Towers Watson’s 2022 Insurance Marketplace Realities report, rates will continue to rise but by a small margin.  Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte insights, global non-life premiums are estimated to grow 3.7% in 2022.  Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The property and casualty insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profit. Per Colorado State University (CSU), the 2022 above-average hurricane season may have 19 named storms, including nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes. Per Swiss Re, the industry incurred global insured catastrophe losses of $38 billion in the first half of 2022.  The third quarter largely suffered the wrath of Hurricane Ian, which weighed on the underwriting profitability of many industry players.  Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion. However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, optimistic growth outlook and sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — creating competition for incumbent players. The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry. Accelerated digitalization has become the need of the hour and insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. Per Deloitte Insights, the technology budget is projected to increase 13.7% in 2022. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

The Zacks analyst believes that Disney+’s profitability in recent times was negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney’s leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.However, the company continues to benefit from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. Availability in the Nordics, Latin America and other Asian territories is helping it expand its user base.

Top-line growth was driven by strength in cloud and service provider segments. Networking is riding on strong adoption of Broadcom’s next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers. Aggressive adoption of its next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth.Story continuesBroadcom expects fiscal fourth-quarter networking and server storage revenues to grow 30% and 45% on a year-over-year basis, respectively.

Higher Gulf Coast export volumes will also support its margins.Expanding Solar Market to Boost Enphase Energy (ENPH) GrowthPer the Zacks analyst, the expanding solar market that has set the stage for the solar microinverter market's boom tends to benefit Enphase as it remains a leading U.S. manufacturer of microinverters.New DowngradesMasco (MAS) Ails From Lower Demand, Higher Operational CostsPer the Zacks analyst, Masco is witnessing low demand and foreign currency headwinds.

314,64fafbb5-14a5-3b7d-8433-81941fff16fe,VLO,2022-10-29,Valero Energy (VLO) Shows Fast-paced Momentum But Is Still a Bargain Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-vlo-shows-fast-125012732.html,1666961412,STORY,['VLO'],"[Momentum investing is essentially an exception to the idea of ""buying low and selling high."" Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Valero Energy (VLO) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 19.6%, the stock of this oil refiner is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. VLO meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 23% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for VLO is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.64. This indicates that the stock moves 64% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that VLO has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped VLO earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, VLO is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. VLO is currently trading at 0.30 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 30 cents for each dollar of sales.So, VLO appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to VLO, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$37m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, Dirk McMahon, sold US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$543 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$551, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 16% of Dirk McMahon's holding.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 2.24k shares worth US$1.0m. But insiders sold 74.33k shares worth US$37m. In total, UnitedHealth Group insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like UnitedHealth Group better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.UnitedHealth Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of UnitedHealth Group shares. In total, insiders dumped US$8.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. UnitedHealth Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$1.8b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The UnitedHealth Group Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold UnitedHealth Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, UnitedHealth Group makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Given it popularity, Vanguard has over 30 million investors as of 9/30/2022 and also 18,800 employees.As a private company, Vanguard has been one of the fastest growing asset managers in the last decade in terms of total assets. The company, in fact, had the designation of the fastest growing asset manager in the world for seven straight years up to 2018. While Vanguard had assets under management of $991.9 billion in 2005, the company had assets under management of $7.3 trillion in 2021 and $8.1 trillion in 2022 thanks to its strong growth.In terms of its offerings, Vanguard offers a broad selection of investments, retirement services, and also advice to investors and institutions alike. As of 9/30/22, Vanguard also offers 412 funds worldwide with arguably its most popular fund being the ETF, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI).The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) is an ETF that,""seeks to track the investment performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which represents approximately 100% of the investable U.S. stock market and includes large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The fund invests by sampling the index, meaning that it holds a broadly diversified collection of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key characteristics. These key characteristics include industry weightings and market capitalization, as well as certain financial measures such as price/earnings ratio and dividend yield.""According to the company, The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)'s total net assets were $1.1 trillion as of 9/30/22.Story continuesGiven the ETF's huge size, we consider the most popular stocks in the The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), 'Vanguard Stocks' for this article.Given its huge size, the ETF has economies of scale and lower expenses as a percentage of assets as a result. In terms of its expense ratio, The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) has an expense ratio of 0.03% versus the average expense ratio of similar funds of 0.79%.Given the growth in the U.S. economy in the last 10 years, The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) has also performed pretty well in the last decade.In the last 10 years, the ETF has averaged an annual return of 11.34% as of 9/30/22. Since its inception in 5/24/2001, the ETF has averaged an annual return of 7.27% as of 9/30/22.2022Due to the Federal Reserve having increased interest rates 5 times in 2022 alone, the major indexes have all fallen fairly substantially this year.As a result, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF's net asset value has fallen 19.69% as of 10/26/22. With more interest rate increases likely and a recession also potentially occurring by the end of 2023, the market faces more headwinds and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF could potentially fall further in the near term.Nevertheless, given how diversified the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF is and also given the ETF's stock selection and weighting criteria, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF is arguably one of the best investments for long term investors.In terms of individual stocks mentioned in this article, each stock is arguably riskier than the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF given they are less diversified. Given the uncertain times, it could be a good idea for investors to own a well diversified portfolio of many different stocks across many different sectors.In terms of stocks of unique companies in Vanguard's most popular ETF, here are 11 of the largest ones:Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor the 11 Best Vanguard Stocks to Buy Now, we selected the top 11 weighted stocks from the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)'s holdings as of 9/30/22.

(NYSE:JPM)'s consumer banking business to an extent, the banking giant nevertheless faces headwinds given its capital market and corporate business. With many big tech companies recently missing earnings substantially, corporations could potentially cut back on spending in the next year. As one of the strongest banks, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NASDAQ:META) closed below $100 per share on Thursday after the company's third quarter missed expectations and the company also issued weak guidance for the fourth quarter. Competition from TikTok and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s substantial spending on the metaverse have been headwinds.

Wall Street Analysts Think 29%,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-upside-left-american-airlines-135501630.html,1666965301,STORY,"['TGT', 'AAL']","[Shares of American Airlines (AAL) have gained 14% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $13.97, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $18 indicates a potential upside of 28.9%.The average comprises 12 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $8 to a high of $28, with a standard deviation of $6.76. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 42.7% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 100.4% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in AAL. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for AALHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.Story continuesWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in AALAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, seven estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 63.7%.Moreover, AAL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much AAL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Eaton managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.8% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 13% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Eaton has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Eaton's TSR for the last 5 years was 112%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Eaton returned a loss of 9.2% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 16% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Eaton   (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.Of course Eaton may not be the best stock to buy.

However, an active catastrophe environment is likely to have acted as a drag on the margins for insurers. Some of the insurance companies like Aflac Incorporated AFL, Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF, CNA Financial Corporation CNA and CNO Financial Group, Inc. CNO are set to report their respective third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 31.The insurance space is housed within the broader Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). The latest Earnings Preview indicates that the total earnings of finance companies for third-quarter 2022 are projected to decline 7.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure, while revenues of these companies are expected to improve 3.8%.Factors Likely to Decide the Fate of Insurance Stocks in Q3Premiums, one of the most significant contributors to an insurer’s top line, are likely to have gained from an improved pricing environment, exposure growth and solid customer retention rates in the third quarter. Though an active catastrophe environment comes with its own share of worries, the same usually accelerates the policy renewal rate and prompts insurers to implement rate hikes for seamless claim payments. Diversified portfolios, which minimize concentration risks, are also likely to have acted as catalysts for insurers’ third-quarter premiums.Per the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index, insurance pricing across the United States improved 5% in the to-be-reported quarter. Property insurance pricing rose 8% in the third quarter, marking the 20th straight quarter of price increases in the business line.An economy recovering from the ill effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have resumed commercial and industrial activities, which in turn, might have generated higher premiums in the to-be-reported quarter following solid demand for workers’ compensation insurance. Story continuesHowever, the underwriting results of insurers with exposure to property and casualty (P&amp;C) line of business might have taken a hit from catastrophe losses stemming from Hurricane Ian. Swiss Re expects the deadly storm to produce a preliminary total insured market loss in the range of $50-$65 billion. Nevertheless, reinsurance covers and a favorable reserve development might have kept the insurers ready to counter catastrophe losses and shield their underwriting results.An improving interest rate scenario is expected to have boosted investment yields in the third quarter of those insurers with exposure to rate-sensitive products. Lower mortality rates resulting from the receding effects of the pandemic are likely to have declined claim payments by life insurers. This, in turn, is expected to have driven their underwriting results and subsequently, improved the combined ratio in the to-be-reported quarter.The insurance industry pursues significant technology investments in blockchain, AI and advanced analytics to ramp up claim payments and automate processes. These investments are likely to have saved costs and aided insurers’ margins in the third quarter.   Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed before their third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 31.The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Aflac: Aflac is likely to have gained on a strong U.S. segment, which in turn, is expected to have benefited from the Fed interest rate hikes in the third quarter. However, operations in its Japan segment are likely to have been affected by a lower interest rate environment. On a hopeful note, AFL’s expenses are likely to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter, thanks to its multiple cost-curbing efforts. This might have driven its margins. (Read more: Can Declining Premiums Affect Aflac's Q3 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aflac’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.22 indicates a decline of 20.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

Net investment income is expected to have gained on better dividend income and interest income, and a solid cash flow from operating activities. CINF anticipates pretax catastrophe losses of roughly $252 million in the third quarter, among which $220 million is likely to have stemmed from Hurricane Ian.

An improvement in economic conditions after the pandemic has been generating fresh demand for utility services.Domestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulation of emissions, the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also urging the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels.The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Per the updated outlook of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average.

340,5f160daa-e019-31f4-aafd-b696769b5c4d,LNT,2022-10-29,Calculating The Fair Value Of Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:LNT),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-alliant-energy-123004521.html,1666960204,STORY,['LNT'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:LNT) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Alliant Energy Is Alliant Energy Fairly Valued?As Alliant Energy operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.7%. Compared to the current share price of US$50.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$1.9 / (5.7% – 2.0%)= US$50.3dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alliant Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Story continuesLooking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Alliant Energy, we've put together three essential items you should explore:Risks: Be aware that  Alliant Energy is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...Future Earnings: How does LNT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Earnings rose 32.1% on a reported basis and 17.9% on a constant currency rate (“CER”) basis, driven by higher sales and improved margins.Net sales increased 19.7% on a reported basis and 9% on a CER basis to $12.57 billion (€12.48 billion) on higher sales of Dupixent and vaccines. Exchange rate movements boosted sales by 10.7 percentage points in the quarter. Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.99 billion.Sales rose 15% at CER in the United States and 4.5% in the Rest of the World (including China, Japan, Brazil and Russia). In Europe, sales increased 4.6%.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at CER.Segment PerformancePharmaceuticals sales rose 5.1% in the quarter to €7.9 billion, driven by the continued strong performance of the Specialty Care segment.Sanofi Specialty Care GBU sales increased 19.9% to €4.4 billion, mainly driven by Dupixent.Dupixent generated sales of €2.31 billion in the quarter, up 44.5% year over year. Sales of the drug in the United States rose 45.1%, driven by strong demand for its approved indications, atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis indications. In the United States, Dupixent’s new prescription share and total prescription share rose 49% and 38%, respectively.Dupixent sales rose 38.7% in Europe and 46.6% in the Rest of the World as the company expanded in newer markets and younger age groups.In the immunology and neurology franchise, Aubagio sales declined 3.7% to €521 million due to competitive pressure and price in the United States. Kevzara recorded sales of €88 million in the quarter, down 2.4% due to a difficult comparison with the third quarter of 2021, which had benefited from a temporary increase in demand for IL-6 receptor blockers.Story continuesSanofi markets Dupixent and Kevzara in partnership with Regeneron REGN. While sales are recorded by Sanofi, Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent and Kevzara.Sales of rare disease drugs rose 7.7% to €900 million, driven by the Pompe and Gaucher franchises, which benefitted from favorable buying patterns in the Rest of the World region. In the Pompe franchise, Myozyme sales declined 10.2% to €255 million due to patients switching to Nexviazyme. The new drug Nexviazyme recorded sales of €58 million in the third quarter compared with €43 million in the previous quarter. Fabrazyme sales were €240 million, up 5.7%. In the Gaucher franchise, Cerezyme sales rose 8.8% to €181 million, driven by favorable buying patterns in the Rest of the World region.Oncology sales declined 8.4% to €224 million due to a lack of consolidation of Libtayo sales. In 2022, Sanofi restructured its immuno-oncology collaboration with Regeneron regarding Libtayo by granting Regeneron the worldwide exclusive license rights of the drug. Prior to that, the companies co-commercialized the drug in the United States and shared worldwide operating profits.Sarclisa sales rose 54.2% to €79 million. Jevtana’s sales declined 13.3% to €101 million due to the entry of generic competition in some countries in Europe.The rare blood disorders franchise recorded sales of €336 million, up 3.5% year over year, as higher sales of Alprolix and Cablivi were offset by lower Eloctate sales. Alprolix sales rose 8.9% year over year to €126 million. While Cablivi sales were up 14.3% to €52 million, Eloctate sales declined 7.6% to €151 million in the quarter.Sales in General Medicines GBU declined 8.5% to €3.49 billion, as the growth of core drugs (like Multaq, Toujeo, Praluent and Rezurock) was more than offset by lower sales of non-core drugs (like Lantus and Aprovel).Lantus sales decreased 17.7% to €559 million in the quarter. Toujeo generated sales of €304 million in the reported quarter, up 17.2% year over year. Lovenox sales declined 23% to €307 million due to decreasing demand from COVID-19. Aprovel sales rose 11.2% to €129.0 million. Praluent sales rose 33.9% to €83 million.Vaccines GBU sales gained 23.5% to €3.32 billion in the quarter, mainly due to strong demand for influenza vaccines. Sales were also supported by improvement in Travel vaccines and growth of Meningitis and PPH franchises.While sales of flu vaccines rose 32.4%, sales of PPH vaccines rose 9.1% in the quarter. Meningitis vaccine sales rose 11.9%. Sales of travel and other endemic vaccines rose 64.6% in the quarter. Booster vaccine sales rose 1.3% in the quarter.Consumer Healthcare (CHC) stand-alone unit generated sales of €1.27 billion, up 1.9%, driven by growth in Europe and the Rest of the World region while sales declined in the United States. The CHC segment witnessed strong growth in Digestive Wellness and Cough &amp; Cold categories. Sales in the CHC segment were partly hurt due to a difficult comparison with the third quarter of 2021, which had benefited from COVID-related higher demand.Costs RiseBusiness selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.7% at CER in the quarter, reflecting increased investments in Specialty Care and costs incurred for the acceleration of cloud migration and application development. Business research and development expenses increased 20.2% at CER due to higher investments behind priority assets to boost the pipeline.2022 GuidanceSanofi raised its financial guidance for 2022. The company now expects adjusted earnings to grow approximately 16% at CER in 2022 versus the prior expectation of approximately 15%. It also anticipates a positive currency impact in the range of 9.5%-10.5% on earnings, up from the previous 7.5%-8.5% rangeSanofi expects its business operating income margin to improve to 30% in 2022Our TakeSanofi’s quarterly results were impressive as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. The company, once again, raised its earnings growth expectations for the year, driven by a strong performance in vaccines and the specialty care business.

LOUIS, Oct. 28, 2022  /PRNewswire/ -- A preeminent Jesuit research university and the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services are teaming up to fill a dire shortage of workers in a vital but little-known field.Saint Louis University and Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX) are partnering to launch an accelerated bachelor's degree program in medical laboratory science. The 16-month program will combine online academic courses with intensive hands-on learning and clinical experiences in Quest's Lenexa, Kansas laboratory.""Medical laboratory scientists are the hidden heroes who help save lives every day,"" said Amanda Reed, Medical Laboratory Science Program director and assistant professor in the Department of Clinical Health Sciences at Saint Louis University's Doisy College of Health Sciences.Medical detectivesMedical laboratory scientists detect diseases ranging from COVID-19 to cancer.Using sophisticated equipment and advanced technologies, an estimated 335,000 medical laboratory scientists across the United States perform 14 billion diagnostic tests each year to inform patients' diagnoses and treatment. This includes identifying pathogens that cause infections and abnormal blood cells that could be signs of cancer or other diseases. MLS professionals also perform glucose tests that lead to the diagnosis of diabetes, which affects an estimated 37 million Americans.""We're excited to team up with SLU, a leader in educating the next generation of lab leaders,"" said Doug Hamilton, vice president, Laboratory Operations for Quest's Midwest Region. ""The number of people currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in medical laboratory science will satisfy only half of the demand for these workers during the next 10 years.One-third of our staff is currently at or above retirement age, making the need for MLS professionals even greater.""Story continuesA growing need, dwindling programs Despite performing lifesaving work and receiving great pay and benefits – the average annual salary for medical laboratory science graduates in the United States is $66,547, according to Burning Glass Technologies – these professionals are in short supply.The field is projected to grow 17% by 2030, with about 12,600 openings for medical laboratory scientists during the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the same time, there are not enough colleges and universities investing in MLS education, Hamilton said.A history of MLS educationSLU's collaboration with Quest is designed to fill these gaps with a rigorous program that exposes student to the inner workings of a busy medical laboratory.SLU has a long history of educating medical laboratory scientists. The university's ground-campus MLS program in St. Louis was among the first in the nation and has achieved more than 85 years of continuous accreditation. There is a 100% job placement rate for students within six months of earning their bachelor's degree, and the program has a near-perfect pass rate on the national MLS board certification exam.In Lenexa, students will gain analytical skills and technical expertise in clinical chemistry, medical microbiology, immunohematology, hematology and clinical immunology. After successfully completing the program, graduates will be eligible to take the national board of certification examination administered by the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP).While most patients will never see a medical laboratory scientist, Reed said these professionals' impact on patient care is profound. ""We impress upon our students that behind every blood draw and nasal swab is a person,"" she said.The Lenexa program is geared to those with at least 60 college credit hours or a bachelor's degree in another field. There will be three start dates per year – spring, summer and fall – beginning in 2023.For more information, visit https://medlabscience.slu.edu/.About Saint Louis University Founded in 1818, Saint Louis University is one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious Catholic institutions.

While they are not doctors or healthcare professionals, they serve as powerful advocates. The Community Health Workers will work with and empower individuals by addressing social determinant barriers and support with long-term health gains through health education and connections to services.Through the Community Care Program, BOL is collaborating with the Patient Care Intervention Center, a nonprofit organization that leverages technology, health data sharing, and public health best practices to empower patients and providers to achieve enduring health outcomes and financial sustainability. This data driven approach will be used to develop specific strategies to improve patients' outcomes.""Seventy percent of our health is influenced by things we are not always aware of; things like education, employment, economic stability and access,"" said Dr. Sarah Simmons, Director of Health Outcomes, Bread of Life, Inc. ""The Healthy Houston Collective is our solution to make an impact in our community, through strong community partnerships we will be able to collaborate to utilize the great resources that already exist in Houston and make them available to the people who need them.""In conjunction with the University of Houston Community Health Worker Initiative, the Bread of Life Academy for health careers provides training for phlebotomists and community health workers.

These graduates will receive additional support from the community partner Community Care Cooperative to offer ownership and economic mobility opportunities. Quest has also paved the way for certified Community Health Workers to help supplement 75 Quest locations with staffing for either short-term or long-term employment opportunities.The BOL Healthy Houston Collective includes an FQHC collaboration with charity clinics to provide greater access to quality healthcare. By adding a larger and more diverse network of FQHC partners, the BOL Community Health Workers will be able to support patient social needs to help improve health engagement and outcomes.In response to providing grassroots community-based programs that align with the larger community needs, the BOL Healthy Houston Collective is also adding a CBO Regranting Program to support nutrition and behavioral health services. According to the Rice University Kinder Institute for Urban Research, more than 500,000 Houstonians live in food deserts, or low-income areas where the nearest grocery store in an urban area is more than a mile away. One of the CBO Regrants that will target senior citizens facing this issue is a partnership with Lucille's 1913. Lucille's 1913 operates as a non-profit entity, and their ""Better Measure Program"" will provide nutritious meals to 100 homebound seniors during a 90-day period. Community health workers along with other health professionals will visit the homes of those in the program to identify barriers, conduct diagnostic tests and collect data to gauge the effectiveness of the program.""We are proud to be a part of this important initiative and have the opportunity to provide nutritious meals for homebound seniors to help improve their health,"" said Dr. Robertine Jefferson, CEO, Lucille's 1913. ""Our program includes delivering culturally relevant meals to best support diverse communities in a way that recognizes their backgrounds and empowers them to choose healthy options that align with their traditions and cultural preferences.""The BOL Healthy Houston Collective is partnering with the following professional entities supporting the four areas of this program: University of Houston Community Health Worker Initiative; Professional Healthcare Education Services; Eco-Life Staffing; Avenue 360 Health and Wellness (FQHC); Vecino Health Center; Christ Clinic; Lucille's 1913; and the Community Care Cooperative.About Healthy Houston Collective, A Project of Bread of Life, Inc.St. John's Church was established in 1992 under the leadership of Pastors Rudy and Juanita Rasmus with a simple mission to serve hot nutritious meals to homeless men and women in the downtown Houston area.

Logically, the purchasing of bonds introduced significant liquidity in the system. However, as shoppers can attest, too much liquidity fueled inflation. Of course, such a circumstance presents pressures for retail stocks, particularly of the discretionary variety.Now, the Fed seeks to shrink the size of its balance sheet. Therefore, the net result is a reduction of liquidity. However, too much reduction creates deflation effectively. Then, there are fewer dollars chasing after more goods. This too if done aggressively bodes poorly for retail stocks as job losses (i.e. recession) become a major concern. Indeed, the central bank takes this risk very seriously.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUnfortunately, the issue with the new normal is that whether we have inflationary or deflationary forces dominate, all roads lead to likely pain. Therefore, investors must consider unwinding the riskiest retail stocks in their portfolios.GPSGap$10.74FLFoot Locker$32.18AEOAmerican Eagle Outfitters$11.13ANFAbercrombie &amp; Fitch$18.19CVNACarvana$14.87MODGTopgolf Callaway Brands$17.80PTONPeloton Interactive$7.52Gap (GPS)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockA once-popular and trendy apparel retailer, Gap (NYSE:GPS) finds itself struggling for oxygen. Since the start of this year, GPS shares fell almost 43%. To put this figure into context, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is down about 21% during the same period. To be fair, GPS gained 26% in the trailing month, making for a surprising contrarian wager. Nevertheless, astute investors should probably back off.According to Gurufocus.com, Gap may be a possible value trap. The investment resource also identified GPS as one of the retail stocks suffering from high risk; specifically, sensitivity to economic or industry trends. Much of the problem centers on its less-than-desirable resilience in the balance sheet combined with a poor growth trek.Story continuesNotably, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate sits at 0.6%, below the industry median’s 2.2%. Also, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate dipped into negative territory to the tune of 44.4%. With a negative return on equity to boot, Gap represents one of the retail stocks to avoid.Foot Locker (FL)Foot Locker Stock Is Getting a Major Boost from Nike's SuccessSource: ShutterstockA sports apparel retailer, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) fundamentally suffers from competitive pressures. Mainly, some of the top brands in this space now offer their products directly to their customers. That leaves Foot Locker largely playing the role of the middleman entity, which isn’t pleasant under this economic ecosystem. After all, why bother going to the store (using gas and time) when the desired products can be shipped directly to home?It turns out, traders likely have the same questions about FL and similar retail stocks. Since the beginning of this year, FL dropped over 31% of its equity value. However, in this case, the nearer-term trajectory remains negative. For instance, in the trailing month, shares dropped over 9% of market value.According to Gurufocus.com, Foot Locker is a possible value trap. That’s not surprising because the resource warned its users that FL may suffer from a shrinking business. Indeed, while its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.1% (above the industry median), the company performed relatively poorly in the quarter that ended July 31, 2022.Back then, revenue declined 9.2% on a year-over-year basis. Also, operating income fell by half. This is clearly one of the retail stocks to be cautious about.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO)a person carrying several shopping bagsSource: ShutterstockA generation ago, American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) represented one of the popular apparel brands. It’s what the cool kids bought. Nowadays, not so much. Indeed, the price chart provides all the evidence you need. On a year-to-date basis, American Eagle shares dropped almost 58% in equity value. And on a trailing five-year basis, AEO still finds itself below parity by a shocking 22%.To be fair, AEO swung higher by 9% in the trailing month. Nevertheless, outside of extreme contrarian trades, it’s difficult to see the fundamental value for American Eagle. According to Gurufocus.com, AEO may be a possible value trap. On paper, the underlying company prints attractive stats, such as a forward price-earnings ratio of 10.7 times (below 62% of its peers).However, you don’t want to let math tricks lull you into not recognizing economic fluctuation risks. Frankly, for the current generation of youth, American Eagle lacks pizzazz. Therefore, its three-year revenue growth rate of 2.3% is middling. It’s another one of the top retail stocks to sellEven more problematic, in its latest quarter ended in July 2022, revenue came in flat. As well, the company posted a net loss of $42 million as opposed to a net income of $122 million in the year-ago period. Again, the facts state that AEO represents one of the retail stocks to avoid.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF)a man shopping in a storeSource: ShutterstockWhile I didn’t intend to target apparel-related retail stocks, Gurufocus.com’s screener identified the most vulnerable names. Unfortunately, the apparel sector presents significant concerns. For instance, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE:ANF) may have provided prior generations with compelling threads. Today, ANF struggles badly, with its share price down over 50% YTD.To be completely transparent, ANF did gain almost 12% in the trailing month, which is certainly not nothing. However, I fail to see how this will fundamentally change the bearish trajectory. Per Gurufocus.com, ANF brings a possible value trap to the table. Again, it’s not surprising. With so many similar brands competing for the same shrinking pie, the narrative will likely only get more difficult.While I wouldn’t characterize Abercrombie &amp; Fitch as a bankruptcy risk – it does have decent (though not great) strengths in the balance sheet – its forward projection raises questions. Currently, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 4.5%, slightly better than average.However, in its July 2022 quarter, ANF posted revenue that slipped 7% YOY. As well, it posted a net loss rather than net income like in the year-ago quarter. Thus, ANF is one of the retail stocks to avoid.Carvana (CVNA)Source: ShutterstockAt the first mention of Carvana (NYSE:CVNA), the bearish argument almost speaks for itself. Involved in the auto sales business, Carvana suffered from both skyrocketing inflation and more recently, skyrocketing interest rates. Either way, these two monetary forces imposed significant pressure on the underlying business. It’s another one of the top retail stocks to sellStill, I’m not entirely negative about auto-sales-related retail stocks because of fundamental demand. With the average age of vehicles on U.S. roadways hitting a record 12.2 years, it makes sense for many households to replace their cars rather than to repair a money pit. However, CVNA specifically raises serious questions.For one thing, shares slipped over 94% on a YTD basis – yes, you read that right. Financially, Gurufocus.com rates Carvana unsurprisingly as a possible value trap. The problem is that while demand for transportation may be somewhat inelastic, the mechanism to purchase it is not.Stated differently, why should anyone deal with the higher prices (associated with greater conveniences) of Carvana when they can go directly to a brick-and-mortar dealership for a better offering?Topgolf Callaway Brands (MODG)a man golfing on a golf courseSource: sattahipbeach/Shutterstock.comAccording to its corporate profile, Topgolf Callaway Brands (NYSE:MODG) is an American global sports equipment manufacturing company that designs, manufactures, markets, and sells golf equipment. On some levels, golf-related retail stocks present an attractive case. That’s because lots of rich folks golf – it’s what they do for some reason.Unfortunately, this stereotype did not pan out for MODG stock so far this year. Since the January opener, Topgolf Callaway shares fell 38%. That’s not too terrible considering some of the awful retail stocks mentioned above. However, in the trailing month, MODG lost over 10% of its equity value, reflecting both longer-term and nearer-term bearishness.Financially, Gurufocus.com warns that Topgolf Callaway may be a possible value trap. It’s difficult to argue otherwise. Sure, right now, the company prints strong three-year revenue-related performance metrics. And even in Q2 of this year, Topgolf posted strong results on the top and bottom lines.But with economic trends moving in the wrong direction, such sales and earnings growth may no longer be predictable. MODG is one of the top retail stocks to sell.Peloton Interactive (PTON)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comOnce the toast of Wall Street during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) enabled people to stay fit while in quarantine. As several scientific resources pointed out, many people gained unwanted weight during the global health crisis. Those that didn’t – or even lost weight – may have been Peloton customers.However, with the fading of the crisis, the narrative undergirding PTON and related retail stocks lost its sheen. As a result, since the start of this year, PTON hemorrhaged a worrying 80% of its equity value. As well, in the trailing month, shares slipped nearly 15%. No matter what, the underlying company can’t catch a break, which presents one reason to avoid it.The other? At this point, the financial situation for Peloton raises many fears. Per Gurufocus.com, PTON may be a value trap. Sadly, it’s hard to see how management can work its way out of the hole. For instance, Peloton’s Altman Z-Score is 1.8 below parity, reflecting a fiscally distressed business.Additionally, it features negative profit margins and sharply reduced revenue based on its latest quarterly report. With such a messy situation, it’s best to avoid Peloton. It’s also top on the list of retail stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Trading At A 44% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-120034643.html,1666958434,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$15.8bUS$16.7bUS$16.6bUS$16.3bUS$17.0bUS$17.2bUS$17.4bUS$17.6bUS$17.9bUS$18.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.91%Est @ 1.23%Est @ 1.46%Est @ 1.61%Est @ 1.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$14.8kUS$14.6kUS$13.6kUS$12.6kUS$12.3kUS$11.6kUS$11.0kUS$10.5kUS$10.0kUS$9.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$121bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$394bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$394b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$206bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$326b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$44.4, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.009. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?
