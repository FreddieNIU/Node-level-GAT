Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting."", 'Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date.

Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Moody's has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average.

"", ""It's the question many investors are asking -- and for good reason. Shares of the hottest AI stocks, like Nvidia, cooled off in recent weeks."", 'Nevertheless, we must remember that holding through volatile, choppy markets is integral to the buy-and-hold strategy. Moreover, despite the current pessimism seeping into the market, the AI revolution is set to roll on for many years to come -- meaning there are still great AI stocks out there.', 'Here are two that our panel of Motley Fool contributors think are worth considering and one they want to avoid.', ""Jake Lerch (Microsoft): Sometimes it's best to keep things simple. That's why my best AI stock to own right now is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)."", ""Sure, Microsoft's stock isn't likely to go parabolic if the AI rally once again picks up steam. However, what the stock lacks in sizzle, it makes up for in stability: It's easy to sleep knowing you own Microsoft for the long term. "", ""Even though Microsoft is moving full-speed ahead on AI, it's far from a one-trick pony. The company has many business segments, such as gaming, enterprise and personal computing software, cloud services, and advertising. That diversification should comfort investors because the company relies on something other than just the growth of AI to fuel its revenue, profits, and cash flow."", 'In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on March 31, 2024), Microsoft generated $61.9 billion in revenue, up 17% from a year earlier. Crucially, about $8.4 billion was returned to shareholders through dividend payments and stock buybacks.', ""That means Microsoft investors are getting paid to wait while the volatility in the AI sector sorts itself out. That can't be said for every AI stock, and it's one of the big reasons investors should still consider Microsoft stock a buy now."", ""Justin Pope (Amazon): Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) seems like a no-brainer, table-pounding buy today. The technology giant is a key chess piece in the AI game moving forward thanks to its market leadership in cloud services with AWS. Amazon is integrating AI functions into AWS to make it a foundation for customers to build and run their AI models. That's the 10-second elevator pitch. However, the company's recent short-term performance underlines the stock's value today."", 'The company just turned in stellar Q1 results. Trailing 12-month operating cash jumped 82% year over year to over $99 billion. Valuing the stock on earnings or free cash flow is tricky because Amazon stubbornly invests most of its profits to grow the business. Unlike Meta Platforms and Alphabet, there are no dividends here.', ""Looking at the stock versus its operating cash flow gives investors a true peek at Amazon's value. As shown below, Amazon is now valued near its lowest multiple on operating cash flow in a decade despite the stock surging over 70% this past year."", ""Amazon's magnificent rally might have plenty of juice left. The business is firing on all cylinders, and long-term investors get a diverse multiheaded monster packed with e-commerce, cloud, and advertising growth that keeps one industry from swaying the broader business. Buy Amazon confidently and hold for what should be stellar long-term returns."", ""Will Healy (C3.ai): At first glance, C3.ai (NYSE: AI) may look like a stock to buy. It develops AI-enhanced enterprise software that integrates with a company's existing software infrastructure, putting it in the company of other fast-growing AI stocks."", 'Additionally, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has fallen below 10. While not ""cheap,"" it compares well to many other AI companies that continue to trade at elevated valuations.', 'However, investors can find significant problems when they examine the business more closely. For one, it expects to generate just over 35% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from oilfield services giant Baker Hughes. The current Baker Hughes contract expires in April 2025, meaning that revenue could soon disappear without a new agreement.', 'Moreover, C3.ai will likely remain in poor financial shape even if it continues its business relationship with Baker Hughes. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, its $224 million in revenue rose by 15% versus the same year-ago period. This significantly lags many other AI stocks growing revenue at much faster rates.', 'Furthermore, its operating expenses for the period came in at $363 million, almost 1.5 times its revenue. This resulted in a net loss for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 at $207 million.', 'Admittedly, it holds about $723 million in liquidity, indicating it can maintain this pace in the near term. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether the company will ever become profitable, and such conditions could explain why C3.ai stock has given back most of its 12-month gains.', 'Between the uncertainty of the Baker Hughes relationship and the massive financial losses, investors are probably better off deploying capital in other AI stocks.', 'Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Microsoft really kicked things off following an investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. For a brief moment, it looked like Microsoft may have outmaneuvered its big tech peers.', ""However, e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has started to emerge as formidable competitor in the AI realm. Let's dig into what Amazon is doing to accelerate its business, and explore why now is an incredible opportunity to scoop up shares."", ""The macroeconomy has faced some stark challenges over the last couple of years, with unusually high inflation and rising interest rates impacting businesses and consumers. Unfortunately, Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing operations are not immune to these measures, and the company's financial results undermine that."", ""At the end of the first quarter of 2023, Amazon's free cash flow on a trailing-12-month basis stood at a negative $3.3 billion. Indeed, the chart illustrates the magnitude of Amazon's cash burn during periods of peak inflation and decelerating growth."", ""However, fast-forward a year, and the narrative has changed dramatically. For the trailing-12-month period ended March 31, Amazon's free cash flow was $50.1 billion. Since bottoming out last spring, Amazon has turned its ship around and consistently generated positive cash flow. One of the big contributors to this turnaround is some acceleration in the cloud business in particular."", 'What has Amazon been doing to jump-start its cloud services? Similar to Microsoft, Amazon has made some notable moves of its own in AI.', ""Back in September, Amazon announced that it was investing $4 billion into an AI start-up called Anthropic. Interestingly, Anthropic's co-founders originally came from OpenAI. Per the terms of the deal, Anthropic agreed to primarily use Amazon's cloud infrastructure -- Amazon Web Services (AWS)."", ""This is a subtle, yet lucrative, component of the partnership with Anthropic because it should help lead to new sources of lead generation for AWS. Furthermore, Anthropic will also be training future versions of its generative AI models using Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips. I see this as another savvy move by Amazon."", ""At the moment, the AI chip market is dominated by Nvidia. And while Nvidia will likely continue owning considerable market share, Amazon's investments in developing its own chips and data centers could unlock further gains in the cloud business over the long run."", ""I think many investors are overlooking Amazon's progress and are thinking too narrowly as it pertains to the macroeconomy. The current inflation rate of 3.5% is well above the Federal Reserve's long-term target rate of 2%. However, it's important to understand just how much inflation has cooled compared to peak levels two years ago."", ""The chart paints an interesting picture. Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio reached a 10-year high back in 2020. However, not long after, the company's P/S ratio began sliding dramatically as inflation started soaring. Now, as inflation begins to cool, Amazon's P/S multiple appears to be normalizing."", 'What I find fascinating about the dynamics in the chart is that even though Amazon\'s valuation multiples are rising, they are far from prior highs. On top of all of that, Amazon\'s P/S ratio is the lowest among the ""Magnificent Seven"" peer set. Considering how much Amazon has grown and redefined itself as an AI behemoth over the last couple of years, I think now is an opportunity to buy some shares at a discount.', ""I think the growth narrative surrounding Amazon is clear. The company is in early stages of AI development, but it's already making major strides. Given the company's robust operating picture and dominant position in both e-commerce and cloud software, I'm encouraged by Amazon's momentum and am bullish they can keep it up."", 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Nevertheless, Wall Street has been more interested in growth lately, and so the company's dividend-focused funds have trailed the market in the past decade.

Conversely, dividend stocks tend to outperform when indexes are dropping or when fears are rising about a recession on the way."", ""Still, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF has outpaced its peers by a wide margin after gaining 170% in the past decade.

Expenses are low, and the dividend appreciation fund delivers a current yield of 1.8%. That's a bit better than you would get from owning the wider stock market, which yields 1.4% today."", ""Yet there are much higher yields available to income investors. Vanguard's International High Dividend Yield fund pays nearly 5%, for example. Several members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average also pay over 3%."", 'Yet the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF offers a better balance between tech stocks and sturdy income stocks than you\'ll find with most other ETFs. Owning either the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index ETF, or the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF will give extra exposure to huge tech giants. The ""Magnificent Seven"" are all represented in the top 10 holdings of these ETFs, for example.', 'That means your returns might lag the broader market during tech-fueled rallies like the one that investors have seen this past year. Yet the Dividend Appreciation ETF will likely beat the market during downturns or any time there are spiking fears about a recession on the way.', ""The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF won't cover all items on an income investor's wish list. It would play a powerful role as part of a diversified portfolio, though, that includes other ETFs and perhaps some individual dividend stocks as well.

The billionaire investor has a reputation for sticking with companies whose earnings and cash flow trends are predictable well into the future. That's much easier to do with a company like Coca-Cola than it is for one like Nvidia."", 'Yet Buffett\'s Berkshire Hathaway has held onto a big investment into another tech stock that, like Nvidia, is a member of the ""Magnificent Seven."" Let\'s look at some reasons why Berkshire Hathaway might be holding onto Amazon\xa0(NASDAQ: AMZN) as an excellent long-term growth investment.', ""The e-commerce titan's late-April earnings report was packed with good news for investors, including positive revenue trends. Amazon added $16 billion to its sales footprint in the quarter, translating into a 13% increase year over year. Cash trends were just as impressive, though, and point to potentially massive earnings growth ahead."", 'Amazon has been cutting costs even as its sales are tilting more toward cloud services versus low-margin product sales. You can see evidence of the dramatic financial impact here in the fact that operating cash flow has nearly doubled to $99 billion over the past year.', 'Management focuses on long-term growth in this key financial metric, and it\'s clear that gains here are helping push earnings higher as well. Amazon\'s net income soared to $10 billion from just $3 billion in Q1. ""It was a good start to the year across the business,"" CEO Andy Jassy said, in a press release.', ""You'd be wrong to think that this business is too big to grow. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment is booming as companies speed up their migrations to the cloud. There's even more excitement for expansion in the platform now that artificial intelligence (AI) is boosting its value."", ""All told, that segment accelerated to a blazing 17% growth rate last quarter, beating the pace of Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. AWS is now running at a $100 billion annual sales rate."", ""Amazon's e-commerce business has also returned to fast growth following its post-pandemic hangover. Gains here reflect the company's unmatchable scale and its huge market share in this attractive industry. Many smaller rivals, including eBay, have described challenges in keeping sales moving higher. It's great news for Amazon investors, then, that the company is still winning market share and adding to its huge industry lead."", ""As Buffett likes to point out, owning a wonderful business won't do much for your portfolio if you pay too high of a price for it. That's an elevated risk for most stocks today given the market's rally over the past year. Amazon has outpaced that rally, too, soaring 80% in the last 12 months compared to a 24% increase in the S&P 500."", ""That's no reason to ignore this stellar business, though. Amazon's shares are priced at 3.3 times sales, making it by far the cheapest member of the Magnificent Seven on this metric. Microsoft is valued at 13 times sales, for context."", ""Amazon isn't nearly as profitable as the software giant, of course. Compare its 8% operating profit margin with Microsoft's blazing 45% rate."", ""It will be a long time before Amazon's margins reach anything approaching that level. But profitability is moving in that direction as sales tilt toward the services segment. Patiently holding the stock for the next few years will allow shareholders to benefit from that positive long-term trend."", 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

In short, this has been an absolutely magnificent Nasdaq growth stock. However, this magnificent growth stock is now down more than 40% from its all-time high in 2021, which is one of the worst (and longest) pullbacks the stock has ever experienced.', 'In hindsight, the impending pullback for Starbucks stock should have been obvious. After all, when it hit an all-time high in 2021, the stock was also trading at a decade-high price-to-sales (P/S) valuation of 6 -- that was easily 50% to 100% more than what was normal for this company, suggesting shares were overvalued at the time.', ""Starbucks stock has dropped, in part, because it was overvalued at one point. That said, the company isn't doing itself any favors right now. Underperformance in China in recent years -- its second-biggest market -- has led to a lower net profit margin than what it had a decade ago."", 'More recently, operations in the U.S. have stumbled. Starbucks reported financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2024 on April 30, with the stock further plunging as a result. Former longtime CEO Howard Schultz was quick to offer his thoughts on social media. According to Schultz, ""U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company\'s fall from grace.""', ""But is Schultz right? It could make all the difference for Starbucks' shareholders now."", 'Investors might be able to debate whether U.S. operations are the primary reason for Starbucks\' ""fall from grace."" But U.S. operations are certainly a contributing factor.', 'Consider that Starbucks ended Q2 (which ended March 31) with over 18,000 North America locations, which was a 3% increase from the prior-year period. However, North America revenues were completely flat despite the company having more stores. The reason for this is that same-store sales fell by 3%, pulled lower by a stunning 7% drop in transactions.', ""Unfortunately for Starbucks' shareholders, the company can only blame itself for this huge decrease in transactions. It's simply not running its stores well."", ""For evidence, consider what Starbucks' management had to say about its order completion rate. The company has over 33 million rewards members using its app, and these are some of the brand's most loyal fans -- they account for a whopping 60% of sales in the morning. Many place orders through the app and pick up in the store. However, these fans are increasingly frustrated."", ""Starbucks' customers are tired of waiting a long time for their orders and are frustrated that items that they want aren't in stock. These customers are placing orders through the app. But increasingly, they aren't picking them up because they're tired of waiting for what they want."", ""In other words, if Starbucks was merely operating efficiently or had items properly stocked, then it probably wouldn't have had a drop in transactions. The problem wasn't consumer demand; the problem was failing to meet the demand in a timely fashion."", ""Because of unprofitability in other parts of the business, Starbucks' operating income for North America alone exceeds its total operating income, showing just how important this region is to the overall business. And operating income in North America dropped 6% year over year in the second quarter primarily due to the loss of operating leverage from lower sales per location."", ""Starbucks was due for a pullback due to its high valuation. But the stock has continued falling due to self-inflicted operational struggles. Shares now trade at their lowest valuation in over a decade, with a reasonable P/S ratio of just 2.3. Moreover, the stock's dividend yield is over 3% for the first time."", ""In other words, from a valuation perspective, Starbucks stock hasn't been this attractive in years. However, the attractiveness of the investment is predicated on management's ability to fix its problems."", ""There's reason for skepticism. Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan has been on the job for only one year, so this isn't the same management team that oversaw huge gains for Starbucks stock. And it seems that Narasimhan sees the company's problem differently than former CEO Schultz."", 'For his part, Narasimhan told CNBC that Starbucks didn\'t ""really attack the occasional customer with delivering and communicating value to them in a more aggressive manner."" In other words, he seems to think the company needs to attract nonloyal customers with bargains, not give loyal customers what they want quicker.', ""Starbucks might slow progress by misdiagnosing the problem, which would be frustrating for investors. But consumers really love this brand and the company has recovered from missteps before, so there's reason for optimism as well."", 'Those who invest now can enjoy a nice dividend while they wait for results, which I think tips the scales toward buying Starbucks stock today.', 'Before you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Starbucks wasn’t one of them.

Those earnings releases often bring with them all sorts of news that can move the market.', ""Sometimes that news is bad, which can knock a company's stock down. Yet that can provide an opportunity for investors to buy shares at a bargain price in a company that still look solid over the long term, despite facing some short-term pain."", ""With that in mind, three Motley Fool contributors went looking for companies whose earnings calls left their shares down, but not out. They found Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG), and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY). Read on to find out why, and decide for yourself whether the market's short-term pessimism has created a long-term opportunity to pounce on."", ""Eric Volkman (Starbucks): I think any notable dip in Starbucks provides a fine chance to get this tasty grande latte of a stock at a discount. After publishing its fiscal second-quarter results, the company saw its shares hit with a monster sell-off that erased nearly 20% of their value. And that's not fair."", ""It was understandable that investors weren't impressed by the quarter. I get that the company missed by a fairly long jump on both the top and bottom lines and posted declines in its all-important comparable-store sales."", ""But this is Starbucks we're talking about here, folks. It's the unavoidable java stop that's a constant sight in nearly every American city -- and still an attraction in many thriving municipalities around the world."", ""The Starbucks stores I visit near my Southern California home are basically just as busy as they've ever been; this doesn't make me jump for joy as a customer, but I'd be heartened and eager to hold my shares if I were an investor."", ""So by my admittedly anecdotal experience, it appears that it's not feeling that pinch everywhere. On top of that, the sales drop-offs could be due more to economic factors than anything else. Other companies in the food and beverage space, such as McDonald's, have said recently that their customers are starting to be more cautious about their spending."", ""Starbucks isn't shrugging its shoulders at this development. It's taking active steps to improve its business and bring back the occasional customers who seem to be turning away from it. Technological advancements should reduce waiting times for drinks and snacks; meanwhile, new offerings in both categories are likely to stir interest and encourage more visits."", ""Starbucks is a long-term play on the world's love of coffee. That's never going to fade, so I'm chalking up the sour second quarter to temporary rather than permanent factors, and ones that aren't necessarily under the company's control. I very much doubt the java king's stock is going to stay at this depressed price for long."", 'Jason Hall (Datadog): When the leader in cloud-data security and observability reported first-quarter results, shares fell sharply. This was despite the company reporting 27% revenue growth, seeing losses under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) turn into profits, and a 60% increase in free cash flow.', ""So why the disconnect? In short, the market is always looking ahead. In this case, it saw the expectations from management, and downvoted the 22% revenue growth the company is forecasting for the second quarter and the rest of 2024. The market always wants more of what you were doing and doesn't love it when the growth story slows."", ""The irony is, we've seen how this short-term focus plays out, even over the past 18 months:"", ""Factoring in this week's drop (not shown above since the data is too fresh), Datadog's stock has fallen post-earnings in four of the last six quarters. But shares over that same period are up a lot because investors have steadily focused more on the strong increase in profitability and cash flows, and become less concerned over decelerating growth."", ""When you look closer, though, things are very interesting. Based on the 31% free-cash-flow margin it earned in the first quarter, and full-year guidance of $2.6 billion in revenue, that's $800 million in free cash flow (FCF) in 2024. That puts share prices at around 48 times its potential 2024 FCF."", 'At recent prices, Datadog stock trades for about 75 times trailing FCF and has averaged about 88 times FCF since 2022, when it began generating positive cash.', 'With very good prospects to keep growing FCF at high rates for many years to come, that strikes me as a price worth paying.', ""Chuck Saletta (Bristol Myers Squibb): When Bristol Myers Squibb reported its most recent earnings, the market swiftly punished the company's shares. Not only did it deliver a massive loss for the quarter, but it also gave downward guidance for the rest of 2024, providing all the reasons that many market participants needed to be spooked out of owning it."", ""As if that earnings miss weren't enough, the company faces a patent cliff, with Eliquis and Opdivo facing loss of patent protection over the next few years. Still, that's nothing new for companies in the pharmaceutical business, and its strong pipeline means that the company could very well come up with ways to replace those blockbusters' revenue."", 'Yet with that decline in its share price comes a potential opportunity. On average, analysts expect the company to be able to deliver $6.92 per share in earnings in 2025 -- after the immediate crisis passes.

The coffee giant posted a sharp downturn in traffic and comparable-store sales, leading the stock to stumble even further. Shares are now down 25% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up 9%.', ""A once-beloved stock, Starbucks has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five and 10-year periods. It now trades at a discounted earnings multiple as investors sour on the company's growth prospects in North America and China. But does this create an opportunity for contrarian investors looking to buy the dip?"", ""Let's take a closer look to see if Starbucks is a buy right now."", ""The first quarter for Starbucks was ugly. Comparable-store sales -- a measure of revenue growth from existing stores -- declined 4% year over year globally. This was a sharp change from the previous quarter's comparable-sales growth of 5%. North American comparable sales declined 3%, while China (the brand's second most important market) saw comps decline 11%. This is perhaps the most important metric for a restaurant, which is why Starbucks stock fell so precipitously after posting these numbers."", ""In North America, consumers seem to be fed up with the company's price hikes with management saying shoppers have transitioned to buying at-home coffee. Essentially, they are trading down to cheaper options as the price of a Starbucks drink climbs to $5 or higher in many locations. You can see this in the first-quarter data: North American price per ticket grew 4% year over year, but total transactions fell 7%."", 'In China, Starbucks is facing heavy competitive pressure from low-cost providers such as Luckin Coffee. The hypercompetitive market is posing an issue for the foreign brand, leading to the extremely ugly comps decline of 11% in the quarter. For reference, Luckin Coffee opened 2,342 stores in China in the first quarter alone. There is a flood of coffee shops hitting the Chinese market, a major headwind for Starbucks going forward.', ""Another concern is the persistent wage inflation hitting Starbucks' margin. In the first quarter, store operating expenses grew 2.4% year over year while revenue fell 1.8%, leading to operating deleverage. Operating margin fell to 12.8% compared to 15.2% in the same period a year ago."", ""Every company goes through bad quarters. Investors need to figure out whether these Starbucks numbers are simply a short-term blip or a long-term concern for the global coffee brand. Let's dive into each market again to see whether these problems are fixable."", ""In North America, food inflation has hit consumer spending at restaurants, and it now looks like coffee consumers are changing their habits too. This is a fixable problem for Starbucks: It has stop hiking prices so quickly. It isn't facing cost inflation from its food or products, either; product and distribution costs decreased 5.5% in the first quarter. A pause on price hikes is necessary to win back consumers in the company's home market."", ""The problem from an investment perspective is that this will hamper sales growth and profit margins. For years, Starbucks was able to grow its comparable sales by raising prices. The future may not be so easy. It's unclear at the moment when the inflationary pressure causing consumers to reduce their restaurant spending will ease, but right now, it's a major obstacle for Starbucks stock."", ""In China, the problem looks completely outside of Starbucks' control. It can maintain a premium brand position (which management says is its strategy for the market), but if competitors continue to flood every city with coffee shops, Starbucks could find it difficult to grow in the country. For this reason, there is a ton of uncertainty around the company's ambitions in that region."", 'Today, Starbucks trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 20. This is lower than the S&P 500 average of 27, and it marks one of the lowest levels Starbucks has seen in recent years. If the future ends up looking a lot like the past -- steady revenue growth, strong margins, growing store count -- Starbucks stock would likely be a buy here.', ""But prospective investors should have concerns the company's future is not like its past. It may have finally hit a ceiling on price increases, and the Chinese market is getting saturated with coffee shops quickly."", ""Even though the stock looks cheap, Starbucks is in a rough spot that may persist for many years.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Synopsys' current trading price of US$557 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy?

We find that Synopsys’s ratio of 60.34x is above its peer average of 43.4x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Software industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Synopsys’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest.

It looks like the results were a bit of a negative overall. While revenues of US$1.9b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings were less than expected, missing estimates by 3.6% to hit US$0.42 per share. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Monster Beverage ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Monster Beverage from 22 analysts is for revenues of US$7.88b in 2024. If met, it would imply a reasonable 7.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to swell 12% to US$1.81. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$7.94b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.80 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$62.04, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Monster Beverage analyst has a price target of US$69.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$46.00. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Monster Beverage's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 9.9% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 13% over the past five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 5.1% per year. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Monster Beverage is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

Then she found out she could get an iPad out of it.', 'For years, finding ZYN pouches and containers around the house was “the most irritating thing,” Darlene, a 24-year-old personal trainer, told Fortune. But after learning about the brand’s rewards program through TikTok in February, the irritation took on a different form.', '“I’m gonna take advantage of this,” Darlene told Fortune.', 'ZYN’s tobacco-free oral nicotine pouches come in packs of 15, inside circular plastic containers resembling a can of Ice Breakers mints. Each container comes with a unique code that can be redeemed on the company’s website for 15 points—but they can only scan 60 cans per month. Users can then cash in their points for a series of prizes, ranging from handbags to air fryers.', ""“I feel like a kid in an arcade who’s getting all their tickets, and they're going to earn a prize,” said Darlene. “That’s how it feels.”"", 'After months of hoarding ZYN containers and painstakingly scanning in each unique code, Darlene was able to score a $50 Amazon gift card. Now, she’s trying to rack up 7,560 points—504 containers—for a ninth-generation iPad, or even 15,000 points—1,000 cans—for a Dyson AirWrap hair styler.', 'Most nicotine pouch users take two days to go through a single can day, according to online retailer NicoKick.

ZYN’s rewards program is reminiscent of century-old cigarette reward programs, where smokers could redeem coupons from packs of cigarettes for t-shirts, hats, bags, or other merchandise. But the company itself does not make that comparison.', '“The ZYN Rewards program was modeled after loyalty programs for consumer products and services offered across a variety of industries to reward a loyal consumer base of strictly age-gated, legal-age nicotine users,” ZYN parent company Philip Morris International said in a statement to Fortune. “Items included in the program are based on customer feedback.”', 'Current FDA guidelines regulating tobacco products do not apply to ZYN, said Dr. Zongshan Duan, an assistant professor at the Georgia State University School of Public Health.', '“They have a lot more freedom to market their products in many different forms, compared to combustible tobacco,” Dr. Duan told Fortune. That includes radio, TV, print, and online advertising, he said.', 'ZYN’s tobacco-free status has enabled it to bypass federal and state-level regulations on tobacco marketing—including bans on coupons, branded merchandise, event sponsorships, and giveaways.', 'As for reward programs, those are still federally legal for tobacco products—as long as the reward is not tobacco, according to 2023 FDA guidelines. Marlboro has an active U.S. rewards program with Apple AirTags, $80 Visa gift cards, and Solo Stove Mesa Tabletop Fire Pits among its prizes.', 'However, FDA regulations prohibit “cigarette and smokeless tobacco” companies from selling branded merchandise—think Marlboro caps, Parliament suitcases, or Winston jackets.', 'Social media users have reported receiving ZYN-branded towels, neon signs, and water bottles through its rewards program, though a spokesperson for Philip Morris International said the current reward website “doesn’t include any of those products.” A “discontinued” ZYN beach towel is currently being sold on eBay for $89.99.', '“I think the ultimate goal is the same [as cigarette coupons]—it’s just to increase the user behavior of those products,” said Dr. Duan. “But with a slightly different approach.”', 'ZYN pouches have taken the U.S. by storm—they can be spotted beneath the lips of office workers looking to discreetly get their nicotine fix, or on the front lines of the culture war, after Sen. Chuck Schumer’s push for a federal crackdown on the “pouch packed with problems” led Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green to call for a “Zynsurrection.”', 'Philip Morris International said it shipped 131.6 million ZYN cans in the U.S. Q1 of 2024—a nearly 80% increase from the same period last year. The company’s U.S. business grew by 62% from 2022 to 2023, according to a PMI earnings report.', 'ZYN is marketed as an alternative to smoking or vaping—not necessarily as a path toward quitting nicotine entirely. But the company is adamant that it is not for first-time nicotine users. “If you do not currently use nicotine, ZYN is not for you,” its website reads.', '“A lot of people ended up with accidental nicotine addictions” after vaping became popular, Darlene told Fortune. She said she has seen ZYN usage increase among her friends as they try to wean themselves off of smoking or vaping.', 'Darlene estimates her husband has gone through nearly 10,000 ZYN containers in his lifetime—though she says he has promised to quit before they become parents. Another reason to quit is “Zynflation,” she said. A can of 15 ZYN pouches now costs up to $8 in Colorado, where she lives, up from $4 around five years ago.', 'Ultimately, Darlene said she’ll take her husband’s health over an iPad. But for now?', ""“If you're already spending the money, you might as well,” she said."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Amgen's shares before the 16th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 7th of June."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$2.25 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$9.00 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Amgen has a trailing yield of 2.9% on the current share price of US$310.15. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Amgen ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Amgen paid out 123% of profit in the past year, which we think is typically not sustainable unless there are mitigating characteristics such as unusually strong cash flow or a large cash balance. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 65% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""It's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and Amgen fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Amgen's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 11% a year over the previous five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Amgen has delivered an average of 17% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Amgen is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future."", ""Has Amgen got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been in decline, which is not encouraging. Worse, Amgen's paying out a majority of its earnings and more than half its free cash flow. Positive cash flows are good news but it's not a good combination. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being."", ""With that being said, if you're still considering Amgen as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Amgen (1 is concerning) you should be aware of."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

I'm joined on today's call by Jack Bendheim, Phibro's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Daniel Bendheim, Director and Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy; and Larry Miller, our Chief Operating Officer. Today we will cover our financial performance for the third quarter and provide an update on financial guidance for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

I refer you to the non-GAAP financial information section in our earnings press release for a discussion of these measures.', 'Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures are included in the financial tables that accompany the press release.

Our adjusted results exclude acquisition related items, unusual non-operational or non-recurring items including stock-based compensation and Brazil employment taxes. Other income expenses as separately reported in the consolidated statement of operations, including foreign currency losses gains net and income taxes related to pre-tax income adjustments and unusual or nonrecurring income tax items. Now, let me introduce our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jack Bendheim to share his opening remarks.', ""Jack Bendheim: Thank you, Glenn, and thank you to everyone joining us this morning. We had a very strong third quarter performance led by our Animal Health division, which delivered double-digit top line growth. Within Animal Health, our vaccines segment achieved 26% growth and we delivered an exceptional 16% growth in our MFA and other segment. This translated to an overall growth of 9% in adjusted EBITDA. As I'm sure you can all imagine, it has been a busy few months for all of us here at Phibro and I am glad to reflect that this growth was achieved while at the same time my team was heavily involved in the process that led to our announcement last week of our signed agreement to purchase Zoetis medicated feed additive portfolio."", 'We are excited to onboard new colleagues and products of Phibro and we are very confident that we have the operational strength and focus to ensure a smooth transition. This acquisition will also serve to enhance, diversified and broadened Phibro species and product offerings, and we are confident in our ability to maximize the opportunity related to this portfolio. We anticipate this transaction will lead to strong earnings accretion and debt pay down and will also serve as the engine that will continue to power our investments in the faster growing vaccines, nutritional specialties and companion animal product segments where we continue to see and invest in both short and long-term opportunities. Looking ahead, we expect continuing growth in the Animal Health business as we close out our fiscal year.', ""We also expect to see continued improvements in our Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products businesses as we work through inventory imbalances and now see a rebound in demand. We have affirmed our guidance for net sales adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS, and then will go into greater detail in this presentation. I look forward to hearing your questions following Glenn's, review of our financials."", ""Glenn David: Thanks Jack. I'm also really excited about the strong results in the quarter. Total company sales for the quarter grew 7% and our adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted net income grew 9%. As Jack mentioned, our Animal Health sales grew 10% with Vaccines growth of 26%, MFA growth of 16% offset by declines in our Nutritional Specialties. In the quarter, our Mineral Nutrition segment grew 2%, offset by a decline in our Performance Products. The performance of both Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products improved in Q3, versus the first half of the year as we expected. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, we have seen revenue growth of 3% and adjusted EBITDA growth of negative 3%. Year-to-date performance is led by Animal Health, with 7% growth in revenue with Vaccines sales growth of 23%, our MFA business at 7% and declines in Nutritional Specialties."", ""Growth in Animal Health is partially offset by declines in both the Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products segments. As we spoke last week, we are also excited about the acquisition of the Zoetis MFA business. These products are a strong strategic fit with our existing Phibro core competencies and capabilities. And we expect to deliver a rapid deleveraging profile and significant adjusted EBITDA accretion. As discussed, we expect this transaction to close in the second half of calendar year 2024. For guidance, we are affirming our guidance on net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We have updated our GAAP net income and diluted EPS to reflect one-time costs related to the Zoetis MFA acquisition. I'll start with consolidated financial performance on Slide 4, then cover segment level performance, capitalization metrics and conclude with a review of our affirmed or updated financial guidance for the full fiscal year 2024."", 'Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended March 31st 2024 were $263.2 million, reflecting an increase of $17.6 million or a 7% increase over the same quarter one year ago. The Animal Health segment grew 10%, while Mineral Nutrition grew at 2% and the Performance Products segment declined. GAAP net income and diluted EPS decreased, driven by increased SG&A due to higher employee-related costs, higher interest expense and higher foreign currency losses partially offset by favorable gross profit as a result of higher product demand in the Animal Health segment, Income tax expense also decreased by $0.5 million. After making our standard adjustments to GAAP results, third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased $2.3 million. Animal Health improved by $2.3 million or 7%, due to gross profit from increased sales partially offset by higher SG&A.', ""Mineral Nutrition increased $0.8 million, driven by higher gross profit. Performance Products adjusted EBITDA remained relatively the same. Corporate expenses increased $0.7 million driven by increased employee-related costs. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS both increased 9%. Increased gross profit driven by sales growth was partially offset by higher adjusted SG&A and higher adjusted interest expense with a partial benefit from the reduced adjusted provision for income taxes. Moving to segment level financial performance on Slide 5, we'll cover the third quarter performance of our largest segment Animal Health. The Animal Health segment posted $181.3 million net sales for the quarter an increase of $16.9 million or 10% versus the same quarter prior year."", 'Within the Animal Health segment we reported MFA and other net sales growth of $15 million or 16%, due to demand in both Domestic and International regions. Vaccine net sales growth of $6.7 million a healthy 26% increase driven by product launches in Latin America plus an increase in domestic demand. Nutritional Specialties net sales declined $4.8 million or 11%, mostly due to lower demand for microbial and dairy products. Animal Health adjusted EBITDA was $36.5 million a 7% increase due to higher gross profit from increased sales partially offset by higher SG&A. Moving on to the third quarter financial performance for our other business segment on Slide 6. Starting with Mineral Nutrition. Net sales for the quarter were $64.2 million, an increase of $1.3 million, due to increased sales volume, partially offset by decreased average selling price.', 'Mineral Nutrition adjusted EBITDA was $4.7 million reflecting a year-on-year increase of $0.8 million, driven by higher gross profit. Looking at our Performance Products segment. Net sales of $17.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 reflects a decrease of $0.7 million or 4%, driven by decreased demand for personal care product ingredients and industrial chemicals. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 million and declined 2% versus the same quarter prior year. Corporate expenses increased $0.7 million, driven by increased employee-related costs. Now turning to key capitalization-related metrics on Slide 7. We saw $40 million [ph] of positive free cash flow for the 12 months ended March 31, 2024. We generated $79 million of operating cash flow and invested $39 million in capital expenditures.', 'Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $99 million at the end of the quarter. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.4 times at the end of the third quarter based on $487 million of total debt and $110 million of trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Our net leverage ratio was 3.5 times at the end of the third quarter based on $388 million of total debt and $110 million of trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Turning to dividends. Consistent with our history, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share or $4.9 million in aggregate. As a reminder, $300 million of our debt is at a fixed rate of 0.61% plus the applicable margin. The remaining $187 million of total debt is subject to variable interest rates, although offset somewhat by interest income earned on short-term investments.', ""Let's turn to Slide 8, which lays out our updated guidance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. We have affirmed our guidance for net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. We have updated our guidance for GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS. The updated guidance includes one-time costs related to the integration of Zoetis products. This is reflected in our GAAP guidance but are excluded from adjusted measures. Our affirmed or updated fiscal year 2024 financial guidance is shown in the table. Comparisons are to the prior fiscal year and year-over-year percentages are calculated using the midpoint of the guidance ranges. Net sales of $980 million to $1.02 billion with growth of 2%. Net income of $7 million to $12 million. Diluted EPS of $0.17 to $0.30."", 'Adjusted EBITDA of $106 million to $112 million, a decline of 3%. Adjusted net income of $42 million to $47 million, a decline of 9%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.04 to $1.16, a decline of 9%. And our adjusted effective tax rate range of 28% to 30%. In closing, we are optimistic as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year. We are confident in demand of our products around the world and look forward to seeing continued improvement in our business as we move forward. And we are very excited about the pending Zoetis MFA acquisition.

That’s where foreign equities come in, with the space offering some notable advantages to U.S. investors right now.', 'That’s not just a one-off observation, either, but a trend; asset managers at the ETF Exchange conference in Miami this year emphasized foreign and international equities as a space to watch.

It's existed in its current form since 1957 and tracks the 500 largest and most profitable publicly traded companies in the United States. Consequently, it's a benchmark for the stock market and the economy."", ""The obvious implication is that the constituents of this index are some of the biggest and the most influential companies in the world. If they're succeeding or struggling overall, chances are other companies are too."", ""Here's the thing, though: A list of profitable, important, and publicly traded companies isn't static -- things are constantly changing. And the S&P 500 is constantly updating which companies make the cut. In just the past year, Airbnb, Uber Technologies, and Super Micro Computer were added to the S&P 500 index."", 'Just think about it: 20 years ago, the idea of sharing a personal residence with travelers was ludicrous. But Airbnb has made a huge, profitable business of it since. It makes sense for Airbnb to be in the S&P 500 now, but no one would have predicted it years ago.', 'When it comes to Uber and Super Micro Computer, both businesses have improved enough to warrant inclusion. At one time, Uber had questionable profit prospects, but management cut spending and turned the corner. For its part, Super Micro Computer is suddenly at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, earning it its own spot.', ""Investors can't know for sure which company will be next added to the S&P 500. But according to Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal, financial technology (fintech) company Block (NYSE: SQ) will likely be added this year. Here's why and here's what investors should do about it."", ""Block is a fintech company, primarily offering products and services to individuals and businesses. Between fintech services to individuals through its Cash App ecosystem, as well as to businesses through its Square ecosystem, the company has processed over $200 billion in payment volume in the past year -- if you're looking for a consequential company for the S&P 500, this level of volume is worth noting."", 'Block generates revenue by taking a small percentage from transactions, and by offering many fintech software services. And this can be a very lucrative business.', ""To be clear, the company hasn't been consistently profitable since going public in 2015. But it's a recent point of emphasis, and profits absolutely surged higher in the first quarter of 2024, hitting an all-time quarterly high of $472 million."", ""Importantly, Block's Q1 net income boosted total net income over the last 12 months into positive territory. That's another thing that's needed for inclusion into the S&P 500. Therefore, it seems that El-Assal is definitely on the right track regarding his prediction for Block."", 'There\'s a thing called ""the index effect"" -- an investing observation that notes that stocks outperform the S&P 500 for a short time when it\'s announced they\'re going to be included in the index. The reason for this is that index funds have to buy shares after the announcement, boosting the price because of buying demand.', ""However, a September 2021 study from S&P Global found that the index effect is increasingly less prominent due to higher overall stock market liquidity. In short, investors shouldn't buy Block stock in anticipation of it being added to the S&P 500. If shares do jump on the announcement, the move will likely be small and short-lived."", ""However, it's worth noting that those who make decisions for S&P 500 inclusion won't consider Block unless they believe it's set up for long-term success. Therefore, if it does get into the index, it would be a vote of confidence from financial professionals, which counts for something."", ""Regarding profitability, investors don't want Block to focus on profits at the exclusion of growth. A balance would be nice, and that's exactly what management is hoping to accomplish."", ""Block is using something called the Rule of 40. Other companies use this metric as well. But companies define the term differently. In Block's case, gross-profit growth combined with its adjusted operating-profit margin needs to equal 40."", ""For example, if Block's gross profit grows by 20%, then its adjusted operating margin also needs to be 20%. The two numbers combined would equal 40 in this case. It's a way for management to balance growth and profits."", ""Block isn't there yet -- it's hoping to get achieve its Rule of 40 by 2026. But since introducing the goal, the company has swung from net losses to a record quarterly profit in Q1. That's something exciting for investors today.

His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), has averaged double-digit annual returns for decades.', ""What is Buffett and Berkshire buying today? Two stocks in particular stick out. While technically competitors, they each control a huge chunk of a growing, highly profitable market. Investors have already greatly profited from these two stocks, but it's not too late for you to jump in."", ""If Warren Buffett has taught the market anything, it's to buy businesses that continue to grow for far longer than anyone anticipates. Sure, some stocks zoom in value over a period of months or years. However, compounding consistent growth over decades is the most reliable method of producing long-term wealth."", ""There are two businesses in Buffett's portfolio that very well could be the next $1 trillion stocks: Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA). Regulatory filings currently show Berkshire with a $2.2 billion position in Visa, and a $1.7 billion stake in Mastercard. Both stocks have been in the portfolio since 2011 -- another sign that Buffett is playing the long game with these investments."", 'Buffett has already accrued huge gains through these holdings. Both stocks are up well over 1,500% since 2011. The S&P 500, for comparison, grew in value by just 427% over that time period.', ""Is there still time to follow Buffett into Visa and Mastercard? Absolutely. That's because the same factors that made both businesses so successful are still in place. In many ways, these factors are stronger than ever."", ""Perhaps the best type of business to buy is one that benefits from network effects. That is, the more people use the business's product or service, the more valuable that product or service becomes."", ""Network effects can create positive feedback loops that can persist for decades. Visa and Mastercard are great examples of this. If no one uses Visa or Mastercard, merchants won't accept them as a form of payment. But if millions of people use Visa or Mastercard, millions of merchants will rush to accept them. This dynamic naturally consolidates market share to a few competitors. Just look at the U.S. market. Today, Visa controls 61% of the U.S. credit and debit card market, while Mastercard controls roughly 25%. In combination, these two businesses dominate 86% of the entire U.S. payment card market!"", ""The reason Visa and Mastercard are so powerful is partially because that's what the market demands. Consumers want payment cards that are accepted everywhere. Meanwhile, merchants only want to accept payment methods that customers actually use."", 'In return for plugging merchants and customers into a global, widely adopted payment network, Visa and Mastercard charge a small fee per transaction. Because Visa and Mastercard are primarily software-based businesses -- as compared to companies that require costly physical infrastructure -- even small fees can be very profitable, especially when applied to trillions of dollars of purchases.', ""As you can see in the chart above, Visa and Mastercard both have abnormally high profit margins of around 50%. That's an extraordinary feat, considering that earnings per share have also grown considerably over the decades. You might also notice that profitability has increased as profits have grown. That's partially due to the benefits of scale. As primarily software businesses, Visa and Mastercard are considered asset-light. That is, much of its added profits fall straight to the bottom line rather than needing to be reinvested back into the business."", ""Visa and Mastercard stocks aren't cheap, trading at 30 and 36 times earnings, respectively. But that's a fair premium for such highly profitable, highly scalable businesses that essentially have a duopoly in a trillion-dollar market. Buffett and Berkshire didn't sell a single share last quarter, and it isn't too late for investors to follow suit with an investment of their own."", 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

The company's revenue from the automotive segment stood at $1.1 billion in fiscal 2024, an increase of 21% over the previous year. The segment turned in a tepid performance in the final quarter of the fiscal year, with a year-over-year decline of 4% in revenue to $281 million."", 'Nvidia has been trying to make a dent in the market for automotive chips for a very long time, once boasting customers such as Tesla. However, Nvidia has failed to make it big in this business so far. The automotive chip market was worth an estimated $51 billion last year, becoming the third-largest end market for chips.', ""Nvidia's automotive revenue last year indicates that it has managed to capture just 2% of this market, which may seem a tad surprising as the company is known to dominate the markets in which it operates. However, there is one company that's making solid progress in the automotive chip market and seems set to become a key player in this space in the future -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM)."", ""Let's look at the reasons why the automotive market could give Qualcomm a nice boost."", ""In the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 24), Qualcomm posted $603 million in automotive revenue, up an impressive 35% from the year-ago period. It is worth noting that the chipmaker's automotive revenue grew at a faster pace than its overall revenue, which was up just 1% year over year to $9.38 billion."", ""The automotive business accounted for 6.5% of Qualcomm's total revenue in the previous quarter. While that's not very significant, investors should note that the automotive business produced 4.8% of its top line in the same period last year. More importantly, this segment seems set to drive the needle in a more meaningful way for the company."", ""That's because Qualcomm exited the previous quarter with an automotive design win pipeline of $45 billion. A design win means that Qualcomm's automotive chips have been selected for deployment by automakers or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and they should translate into revenue once those products go into production."", ""The company has generated $1.2 billion in automotive revenue in the first six months of the current fiscal year, a 33% increase over the same period in the preceding year. So, Qualcomm's six-month automotive revenue is greater than what Nvidia generated from this segment in the previous fiscal year. Additionally, Qualcomm management is confident that its automotive business will keep growing at a faster pace than the end market, suggesting that the company is on track to gain more share."", ""Third-party estimates predict that the automotive chip market could clock annual growth of over 10% through 2032 and generate annual revenue of $128 billion. So, management's claim that Qualcomm is growing at a much faster pace than the end market indeed stands true. Moreover, Qualcomm's automotive pipeline has increased by 50% in the space of 18 months since its automotive investor day was held in September 2022."", 'This sales funnel could continue improving, given the secular growth opportunity present in the automotive chip market, as well as the fact that Qualcomm is providing an end-to-end platform that enables multiple functionalities such as digital cockpits, automated driving, and cellular connectivity, among others.', 'Qualcomm is expecting the automotive business to generate more than $4 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2026. That would be more than double the $1.87 billion revenue the company generated from this segment in fiscal 2023, translating into a three-year revenue growth rate of 29%. Thanks to the impressive growth the company has been logging in markets such as automotive, analysts have raised their growth expectations for Qualcomm.', ""The fiscal 2026 revenue estimate of $44 billion suggests that the automotive business could account for 10% of the company's top line in a couple of years, based on Qualcomm's $4 billion revenue expectations. Also, the $45 billion pipeline is an indication that the segment will become a bigger contributor to the company's business in the long run."", ""Assuming Qualcomm does hit $44.6 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026 and trades at 7 times sales at that time, in line with the U.S. Technology Sector's sales multiple, its market cap could increase to $312 billion. That would be a 55% jump from current levels. Qualcomm is currently trading at 5.5 times sales, which is a discount to the tech sector."", ""The acceleration in automotive and AI-related catalysts in the smartphone market could lead the market to reward Qualcomm with a higher earnings multiple, which could potentially lead to more upside than what's predicted in the previous paragraph. That's why investors looking for a growth stock should consider buying Qualcomm right away, as it has multiple catalysts, and it is way cheaper than peer Nvidia, which currently trades at an expensive 37 times sales."", 'Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

But I see an investment that's full of uncertainty and risk."", ""The company continually runs into legal problems, and I can't help but wonder if one day it will follow in the path of 3M, which was also once seen as a top investment option for risk-averse investors who just wanted to collect a safe dividend; it, too, has run into many legal problems, and 3M is now looking to reset its payout after decades of dividend growth."", ""I would argue Johnson & Johnson isn't worth the risk. And given the uncertainty it faces and its low growth rate, it's too expensive, even at what might seem to be a modest 22 times earnings. Instead of investing in Johnson & Johnson, I suggest you consider a better and safer investment in AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN)."", ""Biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has a broad and diverse business, not unlike Johnson & Johnson's. But there's a lot to like about the company with its strong oncology business and CEO Pascal Soriot having said that it's on track to deliver 15 new products before the end of the decade. And for the most part, AstraZeneca has been generating better growth numbers than Johnson & Johnson."", 'In its most recent quarterly results, for the period ending March 31, the company reported $12.7 billion in revenue, up 19% year over year. And its oncology business increased sales by 26% to $5.1 billion. Multiple segments generated double-digit growth this past quarter.', 'Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson is targeting growth between 5% and 7% to the end of the decade.', 'In terms of valuation, AstraZeneca is a slightly more expensive stock than Johnson & Johnson right now. But investors often expect to pay a premium for a better growth stock. And I would argue that up until recently, their valuations were fairly close, in terms of their forward price-to-earnings multiples, which are based on analyst estimates of how they will perform over the next 12 months.', ""Throw in the fact that Johnson & Johnson still has the cloud of its unresolved talc lawsuits hanging over it, and there's even more reason investors should be demanding a discount for the troubled healthcare stock. The company is trying to resolve its talc lawsuits through a bankruptcy filing involving a subsidiary (this is its third attempt), but it's no guarantee that will definitively put the matter to rest."", ""Overall, AstraZeneca stock looks cheap considering what it's offering investors: a reliable dividend, a diverse business, and solid long-term prospects. And while it's more expensive than Johnson & Johnson shares, the premium seems warranted."", 'The main reason I could see investors wanting to buy Johnson & Johnson stock instead of AstraZeneca is the dividend. At 3.3%, Johnson & Johnson stock offers a higher yield, versus the 1.9% yield you can get with AstraZeneca.', ""But if Johnson & Johnson's returns would have been stronger over the years, its dividend yield would be much lower. In five years, its shares have risen by just 5% while AstraZeneca has doubled in value, which is a key reason its yield might look unappealing to dividend investors."", ""There's danger in focusing solely on the dividend (and its yield) without going through the underlying fundamentals of the business as a sense check, because as 3M has demonstrated recently, even a Dividend King doesn't necessarily make for an airtight investment option. What matters is what could happen in the years ahead, not what a company has done in the past.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

But if you want to aim for higher returns and can stomach more risk, consider adding some individual stocks to your mix."", 'Here then are three stocks to consider for your long-term portfolio. Each has been a solid performer, has plenty of potential for further growth, and has a reasonable, if not attractive, recent valuation.', 'PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is a juggernaut in the fintech\xa0(financial technology) realm. With a recent market value topping $70 billion, PayPal recently boasted 426 million active consumer and merchant accounts, $1.53 trillion in total payment volume, and 25 billion payment transactions (as of the end of 2023). Most of us are quite familiar with PayPal, which lets us pay for things electronically, but you may not realize that PayPal is also home to the popular Venmo payment app, as well as the Braintree, Paidy, Hyperwallet, and Zettle businesses, among others.', ""In the company's fourth quarter, it noted that its active accounts were down in number, slightly, by 2%. That's not great, but the fact that its number of payment transactions grew 13% year over year, while transactions per active account grew by 14%, is certainly good. As that stalled accounts number suggests, though, PayPal is struggling a bit at the moment and expects the current year to be a transition year. There's reason to be hopeful about it, because it has a new CEO (from Intuit)."", ""PayPal's 2024 may not be phenomenal, but this is an attractive entry point for long-term believers because the stock price is quite cheap. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio was recently 2.45, well below its five-year average of 4.91, and its forward-looking, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.9 was well below the five-year average of 22.8."", 'PayPal offers no dividend, but it has been rewarding shareholders by buying back a lot of stock, thereby making each remaining share more valuable.

Well, its stock was recently down some 27% from its 52-week high in part because the company's growth is slowing and it's facing significant competition. Given that it's a $140 billion-plus business, it's understandable that it can't grow like gangbusters. Still, there's a lot to like about Nike, and its future is quite promising."", 'Nike is pinning high expectations on a renewed focus on the wholesale channel versus the direct-to-consumer channel it had been chasing. CEO John Donahoe has said, ""We recognize that our wholesale partners help us scale our innovation and newness in physical stores and connect our brands in the path of the consumer.""', ""Why consider Nike's stock? Well, its brand is top-notch, ranked No. 9 in the world by Interbrand, with an estimated value of nearly $54 billion. And Nike now owns the popular Converse brand, too. Support for Nike isn't unanimous, but bulls such as a Bank of America analyst like its chances of getting a tailwind from this summer's Olympics, as well as from product innovations."", ""Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is not a familiar name to many people, but it should be, because it's the parent company of Facebook. Meta's market value recently reached an astonishing $1 trillion, and it encompasses not only Facebook but some other names you might know, such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp."", 'Meta\'s appeal lies largely in its massive scope. It recently boasted having more than 3 billion\xa0""daily active people"" across its family of apps. That\'s up 7% from the year before. Its first quarter of 2024 also featured ad impressions across its apps up 20% year over year, and the average price per ad rose 6% as well. Overall revenue popped 27% for the quarter, while net income surged 117%.', ""If all that isn't exciting enough, the stock is also reasonably valued, with a recent forward P/E of 22, near its five-year average of 21, though its P/S ratio of 8.2 is above the five-year average of 6.5. What gives? Well, some investors are worried about the company's plan to spend heavily developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology and about growth possibly slowing."", ""But bulls love its massive scale, which can be monetized in many ways. Consider, for example, that via Facebook and Instagram's ability to let its users fundraise for charities, it has raised some $8 billion! Also, its heavy investments in research may well pay off, driving even more growth."", ""So consider any or all of these stocks for your long-term portfolio.

Just Beat EPS By 61%: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-just-beat-eps-143419286.html,1715438059,STORY,['PFE'],"[""Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) just released its first-quarter report and things are looking bullish. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 6.9% to hit US$15b. Pfizer also reported a statutory profit of US$0.55, which was an impressive 61% above what the analysts had forecast. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Pfizer ', ""Following the latest results, Pfizer's 22 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$60.4b in 2024. This would be a solid 10% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Pfizer is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of US$1.44 per share. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$60.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.41 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Pfizer's earnings potential following these results."", ""The consensus price target was unchanged at US$31.94, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Pfizer at US$45.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$27.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Pfizer'shistorical trends, as the 14% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 13% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 9.4% annually. So it's pretty clear that Pfizer is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Pfizer's earnings potential next year. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown."", ""Gabrielle Brown: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 3rd quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings."", ""Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan."", ""Lachlan Murdoch : Thank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. This quarter, FOX continued to distinguish itself from its peers delivering 7% EBITDA growth and demonstrating again the strength of our brands and the advantages of our strategy. This result is even more impressive when considering we are comping to last year's third quarter, which enjoyed a significant tailwind from Super Bowl 57. In the fiscal third quarter, total affiliate revenue fees grew 4% with positive growth at both our Television and Cable segments, driven by pricing benefits from our recent renewals. Headline advertising revenues were down during the quarter as expected, due to the absence of the Super Bowl and fewer NFL broadcast than in the prior year."", ""If not for the difference in our NFL postseason schedule, our total advertising revenues would have increased a few percent. Overall, advertising trends at FOX are clearly moving in the right direction, both in the scatter market and in early upfront discussions. Demand for sports remains robust, while trends at FOX News are improving across the board, including the fact that we have now fully lapped the direct response market issue that had adversely impacted FOX News PR revenues. And while there wasn't much of a primary season this year, we do expect strong political advertising for national and local races as well as local ballot issues in the first half of our fiscal '25 which would largely benefit our station group. As we look to our annual upfront presentation next week, our focus on live content and must-watch events, such as the coming presidential election cycle and next year's Super Bowl combined with Tobi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service will favor our enviable position with advertisers across the FOX portfolio."", ""Operationally, FOX News again ended the third quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and primetime. FOX News also strengthened its leadership position inside the category gaining share again, commands 50% of total debuting. These gains are underpinned by a dedicated team of journalists and staff who are focused on delivering coverage and insights on current events most relevant to our viewers. Building from our strength in primetime, we are expanding our leadership across day parts, whether that be mornings with FOX & Friends, afternoons with The Five or late nights with Gutfeld. And we expect this momentum to continue as we ramp action coverage heading into the fall. Tubi ended the third quarter with 22% revenue growth driven by a 36% increase in total view time and 20% growth in monthly active users to just under 80 million MAUs. Our expansive content library and our differentiated user base have solidified Tubi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the U.S. with 1.6% of total TV viewing, ahead of Peacock, MAX, The Roku Channel, Paramount+ and Pluto TV and only marginally behind Disney+."", ""Paramount's debut on the Nielsen Gauge in February of '23 to the most recent gauge in March of '24 to be share of total U.S. TV view time grew 60%, which is faster than any other streaming service over that same period of time. Apart from just its growing scale to be also unique and uniquely valuable to advertisers through its reach and through its engagement. Over 60% of Tubi users are classified as cord cutters or cord nevers and 90% of those user time watching is proactively on demand as opposed to passively watching a fast channel. This positions to be very well as an important part of the growing digital streaming advertising marketplace. We look forward to showcasing Tubi's strengths at next week's upfront. FOX Sports had an impressive quarter with strength across all areas of our portfolio."", ""We finished the 30th anniversary of the NFL on FOX on a high note with 3 NFC playoff games on FOX averaging an incredible 45 million viewers. This was capped with the NFC Championship game growing over 56 million viewers, which is 19% higher than last year's NFC Championship game and the most watched in over a decade. This season also reinforced FOX solid position in collar sports with strong viewers from both college football and college basketball. In fact, in the current academic year, FOX are the most watched college football, Men's College Basketball and women's college basketball games across the regular season. College Sports has grown to become the second biggest source of FOX viewership behind only the NFL. Total consumption of college sports on FOX has grown by over 40% through the last five years."", ""And in the March quarter, we launched the UFL, United Football League, the result of the merger of the USFL and XFL. With this merger, the outlook for spring football is promising, and we are pleased with the results through the midpoint of the season. While the sports calendar in our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter tends to be quieter, FOX Sports is excited to present its summer of soccer, featuring over 200 hours of live soccer coverage across our platform starting with the UEFA European Football Championship on June 14 and Copa America on June 20. This summer will also feature a new schedule from FOX Entertainment, with returning favorites like Gordon Ramsay's Food Stars and exciting new shows like the 1%. This follows a successful spring slate that featured two of the top five new primetime series in Krapopolis and the floor."", ""With Krapopolis, ranking as the number one new Primetime Entertainment Show and the floor as the number one game show season to date. Last quarter, we announced the formation of a new sports-focused digital distribution platform with our partners Disney and Warner Bros Discovery. We are happy to have hired truly a world-class CEO in Pete Distad and he is off to a flying start. In just several weeks, the JV now has over 150 engineers and executives dedicated to building a unique innovative product which focuses on sports fans outside of the traditional TV bundle. We've already launched an internal data service, which I have been trialing this past week, and I have to say it's an incredibly exciting product and we can't wait to launch it this fall."", ""Today's media market is certainly dynamic, but the strength and leadership of our brands and their capacity to convert those strengths financially underscores our considered strategy. Underpinned by our best-in-class balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and just 1 time net leverage. We remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful balance of managing our existing businesses, pursuing new adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Steve."", ""Steve Tomsic : Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX's strategy continues to deliver solid results. Even with the comparison to our blockbuster NFL schedule of the prior year, we posted total revenues of $3.45 billion and grew adjusted EBITDA by 7% to $891 million. Total company affiliate fee revenues grew 4% over the prior year with growth at both our Television and Cable segments, supported by a recent cycle of affiliate renewals. Reflecting the event-driven nature of our business, advertising revenues on a headline basis were down 34% as we compare against last year's broadcast of the Super Bowl, along with 2 less NFL playoff broadcasts in the current year quarter. As Lachlan just mentioned, if not for the impact of these NFL schedule items, total company advertising revenues would have grown low single digits."", ""Total company other revenues were down 22% versus the prior year primarily the result of the timing of sports of licensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter this year. Total company expenses fell 21% year-over-year primarily a result of the NFL postseason schedule differences I just mentioned. Net income attributable to stockholders of $666 million or $1.40 per share compared to the net loss of $54 million or negative $0.10 per share reported in the prior year period. This year-over-year variance reflects the growth in EBITDA as well as the absence of last year's FOX News Media litigation charge and a current quarter book gain on the merger transaction of the USFL which is now being deconsolidated in connection with the formation of the United Football League."", ""Excluding these and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 16% against last year's $0.94. Now let's turn to our segment results. At Cable, revenues were $1.47 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter, while EBITDA grew 3%. Cable affiliate fee revenues were up 1%, with growth in pricing from our distribution renewals outpacing the impact of -- from industry subscriber declines running in the mid-8% range. Cable advertising revenues fell by 6% or $20 million at the national sports networks, advertising revenues were down due to the absence of last year's Super Bowl-related programming, and the world baseball classic. At FOX News, ad revenues were impacted by moderating direct response pricing declines and lower digital traffic, partially offset by higher national pricing."", 'Cable other revenues decreased $89 million, primarily a result of the timing of sports sublicensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter. Cable expenses were 16% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the timing of the associated sports sublicensing expenses, lower costs at FOX News and the deconsolidation of the USFR. All in and despite segment revenues being down 6%, quarterly adjusted EBITDA at Cable grew 3% over the prior year quarter to reach $819 million. Turning to our Television segment, where revenues were $1.94 billion, down 22% from the prior year, while EBITDA increased 24%. TV affiliate fee revenues grew 9% over the prior year as price increases across our owned and operated as well as 30 FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from subscriber declines.', ""As mentioned previously, TV advertising revenues were impacted this quarter by the composition of our post-season NFL schedule, namely the absence of last year's Super Bowl and 2 less NFL playoff games. As a result, on a headline basis, TV advertising revenues were down 40%. TV Other revenues increased $30 million, primarily the result of the timing of deliveries from our entertainment production companies. While total TV revenues were down versus the prior year, this was more than offset by a 24% decrease in TV expenses. Expenses were lower in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the NFL schedule along with fewer hours of original drifted prime time content, including the impact of the industry labor disputes. All in, we delivered quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the TV segment of $145 million up 24% over the prior year quarter."", 'Turning to cash flow, where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.39 billion in the quarter reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming, coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. From a capital return perspective, from the commencement of the third quarter through today, we have repurchased $300 million under our share buyback program, along with returning nearly $125 million to our shareholders via our semiannual dividend payment. Our total cumulative buyback activity since the launch of the program in 2019 now amounts to $5.4 billion or 26% of our total shares outstanding and we remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization.', ""These capital return measures are supported by our robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in gross debt. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby to open the Q&A."", 'Gabrielle Brown : Great. Thanks, Steve.

The simplest, and for most people, the best way to invest in stocks is via one or more low-fee, broad-market index funds. They can really be all you need. But if you want to aim for higher returns and can stomach more risk, consider adding some individual stocks to your mix."", 'Here then are three stocks to consider for your long-term portfolio. Each has been a solid performer, has plenty of potential for further growth, and has a reasonable, if not attractive, recent valuation.', 'PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is a juggernaut in the fintech\xa0(financial technology) realm. With a recent market value topping $70 billion, PayPal recently boasted 426 million active consumer and merchant accounts, $1.53 trillion in total payment volume, and 25 billion payment transactions (as of the end of 2023). Most of us are quite familiar with PayPal, which lets us pay for things electronically, but you may not realize that PayPal is also home to the popular Venmo payment app, as well as the Braintree, Paidy, Hyperwallet, and Zettle businesses, among others.', ""In the company's fourth quarter, it noted that its active accounts were down in number, slightly, by 2%. That's not great, but the fact that its number of payment transactions grew 13% year over year, while transactions per active account grew by 14%, is certainly good. As that stalled accounts number suggests, though, PayPal is struggling a bit at the moment and expects the current year to be a transition year. There's reason to be hopeful about it, because it has a new CEO (from Intuit)."", ""PayPal's 2024 may not be phenomenal, but this is an attractive entry point for long-term believers because the stock price is quite cheap. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio was recently 2.45, well below its five-year average of 4.91, and its forward-looking, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.9 was well below the five-year average of 22.8."", 'PayPal offers no dividend, but it has been rewarding shareholders by buying back a lot of stock, thereby making each remaining share more valuable. This stock has the potential to grow a lot in the coming years.', ""Nike (NYSE: NKE) is another very familiar name, and it's looking undervalued, too, with a recent P/S ratio of 2.8, below its five-year average of 4.0, and a forward P/E of 24.4, below its five-year average of 32."", ""Why is Nike so appealingly priced? Well, its stock was recently down some 27% from its 52-week high in part because the company's growth is slowing and it's facing significant competition. Given that it's a $140 billion-plus business, it's understandable that it can't grow like gangbusters. Still, there's a lot to like about Nike, and its future is quite promising."", 'Nike is pinning high expectations on a renewed focus on the wholesale channel versus the direct-to-consumer channel it had been chasing. CEO John Donahoe has said, ""We recognize that our wholesale partners help us scale our innovation and newness in physical stores and connect our brands in the path of the consumer.""', ""Why consider Nike's stock? Well, its brand is top-notch, ranked No. 9 in the world by Interbrand, with an estimated value of nearly $54 billion. And Nike now owns the popular Converse brand, too. Support for Nike isn't unanimous, but bulls such as a Bank of America analyst like its chances of getting a tailwind from this summer's Olympics, as well as from product innovations."", ""Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is not a familiar name to many people, but it should be, because it's the parent company of Facebook. Meta's market value recently reached an astonishing $1 trillion, and it encompasses not only Facebook but some other names you might know, such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp."", 'Meta\'s appeal lies largely in its massive scope. It recently boasted having more than 3 billion\xa0""daily active people"" across its family of apps. That\'s up 7% from the year before. Its first quarter of 2024 also featured ad impressions across its apps up 20% year over year, and the average price per ad rose 6% as well. Overall revenue popped 27% for the quarter, while net income surged 117%.', ""If all that isn't exciting enough, the stock is also reasonably valued, with a recent forward P/E of 22, near its five-year average of 21, though its P/S ratio of 8.2 is above the five-year average of 6.5. What gives? Well, some investors are worried about the company's plan to spend heavily developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology and about growth possibly slowing."", ""But bulls love its massive scale, which can be monetized in many ways. Consider, for example, that via Facebook and Instagram's ability to let its users fundraise for charities, it has raised some $8 billion! Also, its heavy investments in research may well pay off, driving even more growth."", ""So consider any or all of these stocks for your long-term portfolio.

GM sold 10 million Malibus during its time, but in recent days it's a rarity — a sedan."", 'GM (GM) said the Malibu factory space will now be devoted to making more crossovers, SUVs, and EVs.', '“The Chevy Malibu fell victim to consumers’ shifts from traditional sedans to crossovers of all shapes and sizes. GM also needed room at its Kansas City factory to build the next-generation Chevy Bolt EV,” Autoblog editor in chief Greg Migliore told Yahoo Finance. The Cadillac XT4 SUV will be built at the Kansas City factory as well. “So you can see the hierarchy, and midsize sedans like the Malibu are at the bottom for Chevy and its buyers.”', 'Case in point: Take a look at any mall parking lot or airport pickup zone, where SUVs and sporty crossovers dominate the terrain. (Disclosure: Autoblog is owned by Yahoo Finance parent Yahoo.)', '""Crossovers are a simple choice for many consumers. They do many things well, combining functionality with agreeable driving dynamics to reach a wide swath of the market,"" Migliore adds. ""Broadly speaking, the crossover segment is the appliance section of the car business: a safe choice you don’t need to think about too much.""', 'While mainstream automakers like Toyota with the Camry, Honda with its long-running Accord, and Hyundai with the Sonata soldier on with midsize sedan sales, GM, Ford, and Stellantis have, for the most part, exited the market due to dwindling sales. The Japanese and Korean automakers produce sedans because they can make money on them through cost efficiencies and scale, but that pie is getting smaller.', 'Sales data provided to Yahoo Finance from automotive research site Edmunds.com shows that from 2019 to 2023, the overall market share of new “cars” (made up mostly of sedans, but also coupes) sold in the US fell by a quarter, from 27.1% to 20.5%. In particular, midsize cars fell from a market share of 8.2% to 5.8%, and that of compact cars fell from 8.8% to 6.1%.', 'Meanwhile, the overall sales of SUVs ballooned to 56.3% in 2023 from an already robust 48.5% in 2019, basically taking over half the market. Gains were across the board, with notable moves in compact SUVs (18.8% from 17.9%) and midsize SUVs (16.6% from 15.9%).', '""Popularity of sedans has steadily declined as carmakers have expanded and enhanced their SUV portfolios across multiple segments and budgets,"" said Joseph Yoon, Edmunds\' consumer insights analyst, to Yahoo Finance. ""Customers have signaled loud and clear with their wallets that they crave an elevated seating position and the perceived added utility in every segment, whether they need it or not.""', 'Despite the perception that SUVs are generally more practical and Americans’ predilections for big, brutish SUVs, the sedan body still has a lot to offer consumers. Size-wise, the Camry and Accord can sit four to five adults comfortably, with trunk space that can swallow up several full-size suitcases, comparable to a midsize SUV.', 'With their smaller footprint, more aerodynamic body, and overall smaller weight, sedans are more fuel efficient than similarly sized SUVs and crossovers and emit less pollutants. According to the latest EPA automotive trends report, truck-based SUVs produced a whopping 364 grams/mile of CO₂ emissions, whereas cars produced 260 grams. While overall miles-per-gallon levels are improving for SUVs versus cars, they still tend to pollute more.', 'In addition, better aerodynamics, less weight on the wheels, and a lower center of gravity can mean better on-road performance. Sedans like the high-performance BMW M5 and Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing can run circles around the sportiest SUV.', 'In the upper echelons of the auto market, some sedans continue to thrive because of their strong performance, size, and looks. The aforementioned BMW M5 isn’t going anywhere, and the CT5-V Blackwing has been a sales winner for Cadillac.', ""Sedans also tend to be more affordable. Edmunds' data finds that the transaction price for midsize cars like a Camry or Accord averages $32,029, compared to $48,706 for a midsize SUV like a Kia Telluride or Jeep Grand Cherokee."", ""Even Stellantis' Dodge Charger sedan is still seeing sales success in its last model year compared to the Malibu."", '“Ford and Chevy haven’t been able to win with sedans in years, so [killing the Malibu] is a logical move. But all they have to do is look across town at Dodge and the success the Charger has had for two decades to see how a distinctive product can make consumers want to buy an American sedan,” Migliore said.', 'Migliore notes even after its cancellation, the Malibu name could make a comeback in a revised form (again).', 'Perhaps GM will split the difference and give weary sedan fans a rejuvenated Malibu. After all, if the venerable Mustang name can be repurposed as an electric crossover, why can’t there be an electrified Malibu sedan for the 21st century?', 'Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

On April 25, the company reported better-than-expected financial results for the first quarter of 2024."", 'More importantly, management said it expects to have full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.70 to $10.90 this year.', ""Here's some context for why that adjusted EPS number is important: Earlier this year, when Royal Caribbean reported financial results for 2023, management said it expected adjusted EPS of $9.50 to $9.70 this year. A mere three weeks later, management said that strong demand was causing it to raise its guidance to $9.90-$10.10."", ""Therefore, April's announcements were already the second time this year that management's outlook has improved for 2024. Furthermore, Royal Caribbean's new guidance implies that adjusted EPS could reach an all-time high in 2024."", 'In short, the company has experienced a remarkable turnaround since it was forced to dock ships during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Wave season refers to a time period early in the year when cruise bookings are the highest. Royal Caribbean said, ""This has been the strongest WAVE season in the company\'s history from both a demand and pricing standpoint."" In other words, cruisers are buying more tickets at higher prices than ever before.', 'More than this, management for Royal Caribbean went on to say that on-ship spending during cruises is also blowing past expectations. And this is significant, since a meaningful amount of profits comes from onboard spending.', 'With demand sky-high and profits potentially hitting a new record this year, what should Royal Caribbean investors do now?', ""Business fundamentals are of utmost importance when considering investing in stocks. With this in mind, Royal Caribbean investors should rightly be pleased. As I've noted, people want to cruise and spend money more than ever before. And this is leading to record profits."", ""A company's financial situation is also important. As many investors know, Royal Caribbean and its cruise-ship peers took on substantial debt to stay afloat during the pandemic. The company still has about $19 billion in long-term debt, which is obviously a lot. However, it's been able to refinance some of this recently at lower interest rates, which is improving its financial stability."", 'However, investors need to keep in mind that Royal Caribbean stock is already making new all-time highs, as of this writing. This is measured from its price per share, its market capitalization, and its enterprise value.', ""Therefore, while the business has the potential to reach record adjusted profitability this year, it's fair to say that Royal Caribbean's record-high stock price already reflects this positive development."", 'Royal Caribbean shareholders should be excited: Record bookings are leading to record profitability, which allows management to get its debt back to more normal levels faster than expected. However, shareholders also need to understand that debt repayment will be the priority, and that potentially resuming its dividend is still a ways off.', ""In other words, investors shouldn't buy Royal Caribbean stock due to its record bookings, as this is already reflected in its stock price. And investors shouldn't buy shares hoping for a dividend because cash will be directed toward its financial obligations."", ""The final piece of the puzzle regards growth potential for Royal Caribbean. The cruise line's existing fleet is already fully booked, but it expects to add new ships this year and beyond, increasing its capacity at a single-digit pace through 2027."", ""This single-digit growth in capacity can provide Royal Caribbean's business with some growth over the next few years. But it likely won't be enough to fuel stock returns in excess of the average annual returns for the S&P 500."", ""Royal Caribbean's business is better than ever, and management is improving its financial situation, which may be a good reason for shareholders to keep holding.

That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.38 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To begin with, Ross Stores has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Ross Stores was able to see a decent net income growth of 6.3% over the last five years."", ""As a next step, we compared Ross Stores' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 25% in the same period."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ROST?

', ""With a three-year median payout ratio of 26% (implying that the company retains 74% of its profits), it seems that Ross Stores is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered."", ""Additionally, Ross Stores has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 25%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Ross Stores' future ROE will be 36% which is again, similar to the current ROE."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Ross Stores' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising.

His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), has averaged double-digit annual returns for decades.', ""What is Buffett and Berkshire buying today? Two stocks in particular stick out. While technically competitors, they each control a huge chunk of a growing, highly profitable market. Investors have already greatly profited from these two stocks, but it's not too late for you to jump in."", ""If Warren Buffett has taught the market anything, it's to buy businesses that continue to grow for far longer than anyone anticipates. Sure, some stocks zoom in value over a period of months or years. However, compounding consistent growth over decades is the most reliable method of producing long-term wealth."", ""There are two businesses in Buffett's portfolio that very well could be the next $1 trillion stocks: Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA). Regulatory filings currently show Berkshire with a $2.2 billion position in Visa, and a $1.7 billion stake in Mastercard. Both stocks have been in the portfolio since 2011 -- another sign that Buffett is playing the long game with these investments."", 'Buffett has already accrued huge gains through these holdings. Both stocks are up well over 1,500% since 2011. The S&P 500, for comparison, grew in value by just 427% over that time period.', ""Is there still time to follow Buffett into Visa and Mastercard? Absolutely. That's because the same factors that made both businesses so successful are still in place. In many ways, these factors are stronger than ever."", ""Perhaps the best type of business to buy is one that benefits from network effects. That is, the more people use the business's product or service, the more valuable that product or service becomes."", ""Network effects can create positive feedback loops that can persist for decades. Visa and Mastercard are great examples of this. If no one uses Visa or Mastercard, merchants won't accept them as a form of payment. But if millions of people use Visa or Mastercard, millions of merchants will rush to accept them. This dynamic naturally consolidates market share to a few competitors. Just look at the U.S. market. Today, Visa controls 61% of the U.S. credit and debit card market, while Mastercard controls roughly 25%. In combination, these two businesses dominate 86% of the entire U.S. payment card market!"", ""The reason Visa and Mastercard are so powerful is partially because that's what the market demands. Consumers want payment cards that are accepted everywhere. Meanwhile, merchants only want to accept payment methods that customers actually use."", 'In return for plugging merchants and customers into a global, widely adopted payment network, Visa and Mastercard charge a small fee per transaction. Because Visa and Mastercard are primarily software-based businesses -- as compared to companies that require costly physical infrastructure -- even small fees can be very profitable, especially when applied to trillions of dollars of purchases.', ""As you can see in the chart above, Visa and Mastercard both have abnormally high profit margins of around 50%. That's an extraordinary feat, considering that earnings per share have also grown considerably over the decades. You might also notice that profitability has increased as profits have grown. That's partially due to the benefits of scale. As primarily software businesses, Visa and Mastercard are considered asset-light. That is, much of its added profits fall straight to the bottom line rather than needing to be reinvested back into the business."", ""Visa and Mastercard stocks aren't cheap, trading at 30 and 36 times earnings, respectively. But that's a fair premium for such highly profitable, highly scalable businesses that essentially have a duopoly in a trillion-dollar market.

For this reason, Visa's business can be incredibly resilient and grow alongside economic growth and inflation, which results in increased spending in the economy. While this can make Visa more vulnerable during economic slowdowns, it positions the company well during economic expansions, which tend to last much longer."", 'Growing emerging market economies could be another tailwind for the business. According to Grand View Research, the global payment processing market is projected to grow by 14.5% annually through 2030, giving Visa excellent upside potential for long-term investors.', 'The next stock that can be an excellent holding for patient investors is JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). For the past couple of decades, JPMorgan Chase has proven to be one of the best-run banks in the U.S.', 'Under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan navigated the Subprime Mortgage Crisis in 2008, over a decade of ultra-low interest rates, the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent post-pandemic inflation, and the fastest pace of interest rate increases in over four decades. Today, the bank boasts over $3.4 trillion in assets, making it the largest bank in the U.S. by a long shot.', 'What has helped JPMorgan is its approach to managing its fortress balance sheet, managing the possible tail risks, and giving it flexibility when opportunities arise.', 'One example is the most recent inflationary environment that emerged a few years back. When many other banks were adding loans to their balance sheets, JPMorgan took a patient approach and effectively ""hoarded cash"" to prepare for the tail risk of higher-than-expected inflation and interest rates. This prudent approach paid off. JPMorgan emerged victorious last year when the federal government auctioned off First Republic Bank, which went under amid a slew of regional bank failures.', 'JPMorgan has a firm financial foundation, and its multi-pronged approach to managing risk and navigating economic turbulence makes it another stellar stock to own for the long haul.', ""The last stock on this list that can be an excellent long-term investment is American Express (NYSE: AXP). American Express is known for its iconic branding, positioning it as a luxury brand that customers associate with the finer things in life. It's like an exclusive club, and everyone wants in."", 'The Black Card (aka American Express Centurion Card) is an invite-only card that reportedly requires at least $500,000 to $1 million in annual spending to even be considered. The more widely available Platinum Card commands a $695 annual fee and offers perks and rewards from high-end travel providers, luxury hotels, airlines, and high-end clothing lines.', ""Like Visa, American Express earns a fee from merchants when it processes payments through its network. Unlike Visa, American Express holds on to the credit card loans it makes. This allows it to earn fees and interest income, which has been an excellent source of growth in today's higher-interest-rate environment."", 'Holding on to credit card loans also exposes American Express to possible losses through rising credit card delinquencies. However, it has an advantage in that its premium customer base can better weather economic downturns and high inflation.', ""American Express' branding and positioning have long interested Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, who has been invested in the stock since 1993.

What it hasn't been lately is a popular investment; it has lagged the S&P 500 index, under-performing the benchmark stock gauge so far in 2024. It also trails the index if you go back one, three, and even five years."", ""However, the company's recently released earnings report featured a double beat on analyst estimates, accompanied by some impressive growth numbers. So is Visa, for all its size and might, something of a sleeper stock these days? Or is the market's indifference justified?"", ""First, in order to get a clear idea of Visa's business, it's important to note what the company does, and does not do, to earn its coin."", ""It is the brand adorning scores of credit and debit cards, and it processes the transactions on those cards. For this it receives a small percentage of each purchase. The company is not the issuer of those cards -- in other words, it does not extend any credit, nor does it shift the money from a customer's account in the case of debit cards. Your card issuer, debit or credit, is almost always a bank or other financial institution."", 'In the payment card world, companies like Visa are ""open loop"" operators, in that other entities are involved in the transactions with its plastic. Arch-rival Mastercard is also an open-loop company. Closed-loop operators, by contrast, typically also act as the issuers of the credit, hence the ""closed"" descriptor. American Express and Discover Financial Services -- recently acquired by Capital One -- are two such companies.', 'There is no ""superior"" operating model here; both have advantages and disadvantages. A major plus for Visa (and Mastercard, of course) is that open loopers are basically middlemen that dip into a transaction and get out. Someone else has to worry about whether a credit card holder is going to pay their balance.', 'Then again, closed loopers get to charge high interest rates of credit card debt, and can also harness the reams of data they have on their clients to enhance their own businesses.', 'With its relatively light operating profile, the game with Visa is to get its cards into as many wallets and purses as possible. This is a volume business; the more customers charge on their cards, the more fees Visa can reap.', 'The company has been doing this effectively for years. In its fiscal second quarter, it managed to crank total payment volume 8% higher year-over-year, on a double-digit (16%) rise in cross-border transactions. This powered net revenue to a 10% gain (at $8.8 billion), filtering down to a $5.1 billion non-GAAP net income figure for a robust improvement of 17%. Visa beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines.', 'Good growth numbers and quarterly beats are the norm, not the exception for Visa. So perhaps the ""same old same old"" is why its share price sagged a bit after those second-quarter figures were published. Investors might also be thirstier for yield these days, and Visa isn\'t a great stock for that -- while the company consistently pays a dividend and raises it annually, its yield has always been a blip. These days it pays out at a mere 0.7%.', 'Meanwhile, its forward P/E has fallen under 30 (it currently stands at a shade over 28), at a time when analysts are collectively forecasting 16% growth in per-share earnings this year alone, on a sprightly 12% pop in revenue. Those percentages are predicted to dip slightly, but still land in double-digit territory in fiscal 2025.', 'As long as the global economy continues to be more or less healthy, I think those projections might be modest. The world is still shifting to non-cash means of payment -- standard in the U.S. now, but not necessarily so in other corners of the globe -- and the first beneficiary of this will be the most powerful card company on the scene, Visa. This is a good stock to own, and with many investors ignoring the company, now is a good time to buy it.', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

"", ""It's the question many investors are asking -- and for good reason. Shares of the hottest AI stocks, like Nvidia, cooled off in recent weeks."", 'Nevertheless, we must remember that holding through volatile, choppy markets is integral to the buy-and-hold strategy. Moreover, despite the current pessimism seeping into the market, the AI revolution is set to roll on for many years to come -- meaning there are still great AI stocks out there.', 'Here are two that our panel of Motley Fool contributors think are worth considering and one they want to avoid.', ""Jake Lerch (Microsoft): Sometimes it's best to keep things simple. That's why my best AI stock to own right now is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)."", ""Sure, Microsoft's stock isn't likely to go parabolic if the AI rally once again picks up steam. However, what the stock lacks in sizzle, it makes up for in stability: It's easy to sleep knowing you own Microsoft for the long term. "", ""Even though Microsoft is moving full-speed ahead on AI, it's far from a one-trick pony. The company has many business segments, such as gaming, enterprise and personal computing software, cloud services, and advertising. That diversification should comfort investors because the company relies on something other than just the growth of AI to fuel its revenue, profits, and cash flow."", 'In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on March 31, 2024), Microsoft generated $61.9 billion in revenue, up 17% from a year earlier. Crucially, about $8.4 billion was returned to shareholders through dividend payments and stock buybacks.', ""That means Microsoft investors are getting paid to wait while the volatility in the AI sector sorts itself out. That can't be said for every AI stock, and it's one of the big reasons investors should still consider Microsoft stock a buy now."", ""Justin Pope (Amazon): Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) seems like a no-brainer, table-pounding buy today. The technology giant is a key chess piece in the AI game moving forward thanks to its market leadership in cloud services with AWS. Amazon is integrating AI functions into AWS to make it a foundation for customers to build and run their AI models. That's the 10-second elevator pitch. However, the company's recent short-term performance underlines the stock's value today."", 'The company just turned in stellar Q1 results. Trailing 12-month operating cash jumped 82% year over year to over $99 billion. Valuing the stock on earnings or free cash flow is tricky because Amazon stubbornly invests most of its profits to grow the business. Unlike Meta Platforms and Alphabet, there are no dividends here.', ""Looking at the stock versus its operating cash flow gives investors a true peek at Amazon's value. As shown below, Amazon is now valued near its lowest multiple on operating cash flow in a decade despite the stock surging over 70% this past year."", ""Amazon's magnificent rally might have plenty of juice left. The business is firing on all cylinders, and long-term investors get a diverse multiheaded monster packed with e-commerce, cloud, and advertising growth that keeps one industry from swaying the broader business. Buy Amazon confidently and hold for what should be stellar long-term returns."", ""Will Healy (C3.ai): At first glance, C3.ai (NYSE: AI) may look like a stock to buy. It develops AI-enhanced enterprise software that integrates with a company's existing software infrastructure, putting it in the company of other fast-growing AI stocks."", 'Additionally, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has fallen below 10. While not ""cheap,"" it compares well to many other AI companies that continue to trade at elevated valuations.', 'However, investors can find significant problems when they examine the business more closely. For one, it expects to generate just over 35% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from oilfield services giant Baker Hughes. The current Baker Hughes contract expires in April 2025, meaning that revenue could soon disappear without a new agreement.', 'Moreover, C3.ai will likely remain in poor financial shape even if it continues its business relationship with Baker Hughes. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, its $224 million in revenue rose by 15% versus the same year-ago period. This significantly lags many other AI stocks growing revenue at much faster rates.', 'Furthermore, its operating expenses for the period came in at $363 million, almost 1.5 times its revenue. This resulted in a net loss for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 at $207 million.', 'Admittedly, it holds about $723 million in liquidity, indicating it can maintain this pace in the near term. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether the company will ever become profitable, and such conditions could explain why C3.ai stock has given back most of its 12-month gains.', 'Between the uncertainty of the Baker Hughes relationship and the massive financial losses, investors are probably better off deploying capital in other AI stocks.', 'Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Microsoft really kicked things off following an investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. For a brief moment, it looked like Microsoft may have outmaneuvered its big tech peers.', ""However, e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has started to emerge as formidable competitor in the AI realm. Let's dig into what Amazon is doing to accelerate its business, and explore why now is an incredible opportunity to scoop up shares."", ""The macroeconomy has faced some stark challenges over the last couple of years, with unusually high inflation and rising interest rates impacting businesses and consumers. Unfortunately, Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing operations are not immune to these measures, and the company's financial results undermine that."", ""At the end of the first quarter of 2023, Amazon's free cash flow on a trailing-12-month basis stood at a negative $3.3 billion. Indeed, the chart illustrates the magnitude of Amazon's cash burn during periods of peak inflation and decelerating growth."", ""However, fast-forward a year, and the narrative has changed dramatically. For the trailing-12-month period ended March 31, Amazon's free cash flow was $50.1 billion. Since bottoming out last spring, Amazon has turned its ship around and consistently generated positive cash flow. One of the big contributors to this turnaround is some acceleration in the cloud business in particular."", 'What has Amazon been doing to jump-start its cloud services? Similar to Microsoft, Amazon has made some notable moves of its own in AI.', ""Back in September, Amazon announced that it was investing $4 billion into an AI start-up called Anthropic. Interestingly, Anthropic's co-founders originally came from OpenAI. Per the terms of the deal, Anthropic agreed to primarily use Amazon's cloud infrastructure -- Amazon Web Services (AWS)."", ""This is a subtle, yet lucrative, component of the partnership with Anthropic because it should help lead to new sources of lead generation for AWS. Furthermore, Anthropic will also be training future versions of its generative AI models using Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips. I see this as another savvy move by Amazon."", ""At the moment, the AI chip market is dominated by Nvidia. And while Nvidia will likely continue owning considerable market share, Amazon's investments in developing its own chips and data centers could unlock further gains in the cloud business over the long run."", ""I think many investors are overlooking Amazon's progress and are thinking too narrowly as it pertains to the macroeconomy. The current inflation rate of 3.5% is well above the Federal Reserve's long-term target rate of 2%. However, it's important to understand just how much inflation has cooled compared to peak levels two years ago."", ""The chart paints an interesting picture. Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio reached a 10-year high back in 2020. However, not long after, the company's P/S ratio began sliding dramatically as inflation started soaring. Now, as inflation begins to cool, Amazon's P/S multiple appears to be normalizing."", 'What I find fascinating about the dynamics in the chart is that even though Amazon\'s valuation multiples are rising, they are far from prior highs. On top of all of that, Amazon\'s P/S ratio is the lowest among the ""Magnificent Seven"" peer set. Considering how much Amazon has grown and redefined itself as an AI behemoth over the last couple of years, I think now is an opportunity to buy some shares at a discount.', ""I think the growth narrative surrounding Amazon is clear. The company is in early stages of AI development, but it's already making major strides. Given the company's robust operating picture and dominant position in both e-commerce and cloud software, I'm encouraged by Amazon's momentum and am bullish they can keep it up."", 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

They're very much like mutual funds, often encompassing a big bunch of securities and charging an expense ratio (fee), yet they trade like stocks, allowing you to buy or sell any time the market is open, from your brokerage account."", ""But all ETFs aren't equal, of course. Some, such as index fund ETFs with low fees, should serve you very well over long periods. But others can be dangerous -- and hazardous to your wealth. One kind of ETF you may want to steer clear of is the leveraged ETF, and a good example is the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: TQQQ). Personally, I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole."", 'In the financial world, the word ""leverage"" typically refers to debt, and investors who can stomach a lot of risk sometimes invest with borrowed money. An individual investor might invest ""on margin,"" for example, using money borrowed from their brokerage. A leveraged ETF, meanwhile, is one that employs debt and/or derivatives in order to deliver amplified gains to investors. Unfortunately, it can also deliver amplified losses.', ""Let's review a simple example of someone investing on margin: Imagine you have $1,000 to invest in stocks. You might borrow $1,000 from your brokerage, too, in order to have $2,000 with which to invest. If your investment doubles in value, your stake is now worth $4,000. Great! And you got that starting with only $1,000, so you've quadrupled your money!"", ""But if your investment falls by, say, 70%, your $2,000 stake will fall in value to $600. That's bad enough, but remember that you borrowed $1,000. It wasn't a gift. You actually have to make interest payments on borrowed sums -- and eventually, you need to pay back the money. So you're out whatever interest payments you've made, and you have to pay back $1,000. So now you've actually lost $400."", ""If you'd suffered a 70% loss investing only your original $1,000, you'd have $300 left. But since you borrowed that extra $1,000, you now have negative $400. See? Leverage can greatly amplify your gains and your losses."", ""That's part of the problem with leveraged ETFs. They're riskier than simple ETFs that just invest in various securities in a straightforward manner."", 'Now let\'s look at one particular leveraged ETF, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF. On its own website, it\'s described like this: ""ProShares UltraPro QQQ seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to three times (3x) the daily performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index.""', ""The Nasdaq-100 is an index of the 100 largest companies trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market -- excluding financial companies. So it includes companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and dozens of other major businesses you've surely heard of and probably admire."", ""So the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF aims to give you 3 times the return of the Nasdaq-100. That certainly sounds terrific -- but there's a catch or two. For starters, remember that amplification of losses. Whenever the Nasdaq-100 falls, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF will fall harder. Much harder."", ""And then there's this: These kinds of ETFs are not designed to be long-term holdings that make you richer over years. They're actually designed to serve you over a single day. Lots of investors may not realize that, though, and if they take their eyes off the ball, they can end up in big trouble. That's because, due to the way these ETFs are structured, their returns over longer periods can deviate sharply from the benchmark they're based on. So if you hold this ETF for, say, a month, and the Nasdaq-100 goes up 5%, you may actually end up losing money. (This danger applies to all leveraged ETFs, not just this one.)"", 'The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned investors about leveraged ETFs (and inverse ETFs, another complicated kind of ETF), offering two examples:', ""Over four months, a particular index gained 2%. However, a leveraged ETF seeking to deliver twice that index's daily return fell by 6% -- and an inverse ETF seeking to deliver twice the inverse of the index's daily return fell by 25%."", ""During that same period, an ETF seeking to deliver 3 times the daily return of a different index fell 53%, while the underlying index actually gained around 8%. An ETF seeking to deliver 3 times the inverse of the index's daily return declined by 90% over the same period."", ""Fortunately, while I'm personally ruling out all leveraged ETFs (and inverse ETFs, for that matter), there remain lots and lots of terrific ETFs to choose from -- such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which will give you roughly the same returns as the S&P 500.

Right now, that hot story is undoubtedly artificial intelligence (AI). Companies of all kinds are scrambling to present themselves as being in on AI, whether it's core to their business or not. That being said, because computers, automation, and technology generally drive much of modern society, it is conceivable that AI will eventually impact all or most industries in some way."", ""This marketwide focus on AI has also driven up the prices of the companies that have the most to gain from the rush to bring more sophisticated versions of AI to the market. The fear of missing out has put some great businesses into the valuation stratosphere. Here are three stocks that investors should keep an eye on for when there's a stock market sell-off and they become more reasonably priced."", ""If there's a company that kicked off the artificial intelligence boom in the stock market, it's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It was Nvidia's string of eye-popping quarterly results that got investors to notice the opportunity to invest in all things AI. Nvidia designs the chips that have proven to be very good at helping develop AI, and as a result, demand for these chips has been robust."", ""Nvidia's overall revenue has seen explosive growth, but that has been driven primarily by its data center segment, which is where the demand for chips used in AI is reported. Not only has this segment's revenue grown in each of the last five quarters, but the year-over-year (YOY) growth rate has accelerated."", '\xa0', 'Q4 2023', 'Q1 2024', 'Q2 2024', 'Q3 2024', 'Q4 2024', 'Data Center Revenue', '$3.6 billion', '$4.3 billion', '$10.3 billion', '$14.5 billion', '$18.4 billion', 'YOY Growth', '11%', '14%', '171%', '279%', '409%', 'Data source: Nvidia.', 'Nvidia stock currently trades for 76 times earnings, which is not cheap by any means. However, considering the increasing rate of data center revenue growth and the continued demand for chips to power AI, it may surprise investors that the valuation has come down over the past year. Even so, at some point, demand will slow, and there will likely be more attractive valuations at which to accumulate shares of this great business.', ""Nvidia's impressive revenue growth was driven by the sales of chips that are used in data centers. These data centers are also a driver of results for Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET), which sells the switches and routers needed to run large data centers for the world's biggest tech companies."", 'The growth story for Arista has been less about revenue growth and more about the bottom line. In fact, revenue growth has slowed over the last few quarters, making the rest of its results even more impressive. In the recently reported first quarter of 2024, Arista reported earnings per share of $1.99, a 44% increase over the first quarter of 2023. Arista also generated $520 million in free cash flow, compared to $369 million in the prior year.', ""Arista currently trades for 42 times earnings, which is less expensive than Nvidia but still quite pricey. Looking back over the last five years, Arista's average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is 34, and the average multiple for the S&P 500 is 25. Arista is certainly a quality business that deserves to trade at a premium, but there will likely be better buying opportunities in the future."", ""Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) may not be a household name, but it has a long and distinguished history in the world of technological advancement. With its products in data centers, broadband modems, computers, and cellphones, there's a good chance most investors have used one of their products without even knowing it."", ""Broadcom reports its results in two segments: infrastructure software and semiconductor solutions. Historically, the semiconductor solutions segment has constituted 78% of Broadcom's revenue. However, the recent acquisition of cloud software company VMware has shifted the revenue mix, and infrastructure software now accounts for 38% of revenue."", 'The VMware acquisition resulted in a much higher year-over-year revenue growth result than is typical for Broadcom.

He worked with George Soros in the '90s, famously shorting the British pound. At the same time, he ran his own hedge fund, Duquesne Capital Management, which produced an average return of 30% per year without a single down year in the 30 years he operated it."", 'Since closing the hedge fund in 2010, Druckenmiller has managed his personal wealth through the Duquesne Family Office, which held about $3.35 billion as of the end of last year. Nearly $550 million of that amount was held in stock and options of just one company, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).', 'But Druckenmiller said he cut his sizable position in Nvidia last quarter. And he had a good reason.', ""Druckenmiller said he took an initial position in Nvidia before the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the suggestion of one of his partners at Duquesne. Then, once ChatGPT was launched and grew its user base faster than any app in history, he increased the position substantially."", ""Since ChatGPT's launch until the end of March, Nvidia shares climbed 434% and the company's market cap increased by $1.84 trillion in those 16 months. To say it's been on a historic run would be an understatement."", 'Druckenmiller saw the potential for those types of returns, but he thinks the market might have fully priced in any further growth for Nvidia at this point. ""A lot of what we recognized has become recognized by the marketplace now,"" he said in an interview on CNBC.', 'The billionaire remains bullish on the potential for further advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the business opportunities they can create long term. ""AI may be a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term,"" he said.', ""As such, he cut his Nvidia position. We'll have to wait until Duquesne files its form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission to learn exactly how much of the stock Druckenmiller sold last quarter. He also noted that he sold several other positions in late March. That form is due by May 15, so the wait won't be long."", ""The current run in Nvidia's stock is fueled by spectacular financial results. Despite high expectations for the company, it has managed to beat those expectations more often than not. And continued demand from big tech companies for its data-center graphics processing units (GPUs) has many people excited about the company's future."", ""But it's unclear how long the chipmaker can continue to beat those lofty market expectations. Druckenmiller seems to think that the expectations for the company have reached an appropriate level and doesn't see the stock outperforming, based on its current price. Nvidia has a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 37.5, so the market is expecting huge earnings growth for years to come. That's a big ask for a company that's already huge."", 'Nvidia has benefited from being well positioned in 2022, just before the surge in demand for AI chips. But it might not have a sustainable advantage. In particular, it suffers from heavy customer concentration. One customer accounted for 13% of all of its sales in fiscal 2024.', ""What's more, practically all of its biggest customers are designing their own chips for training their large language models and for customers to use on their cloud computing platforms. While some customers will continue to demand Nvidia chips, the biggest ones are weaning themselves off the company. That could hamper revenue growth and reduce gross margin, which has benefited from a supply shortage over the last year."", 'At its current valuation, Nvidia could find it hard to continue outpacing the overall market. There are better ways to invest in artificial intelligence right now. That said, Druckenmiller still thinks Nvidia will maintain an important spot in demand for AI over the long term.

This is the result of its pioneering work in parallel processing, or the ability of its GPUs to process a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously by breaking the job up into smaller pieces and running them concurrently. The company quickly realized the vast potential of this process and worked to adapt the technology to other applications.', 'Since then, Nvidia GPUs have been used to power AI, zip data through the cloud, run data centers, enable autonomous driving, and more.', ""Over the past decade, Nvidia's revenue has grown by 1,900% (as of this writing), while its net income has surged 9,500%. While this hasn't been in a straight line, the company's performance has been consistent, fueling epic growth in its stock price, which has soared 20,500%."", 'In the company\'s fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia\'s results set new records across the board. Revenue grew 126% year over year to $60.9 billion, while fiscal discipline drove diluted earnings per share (EPS) up 586% to $11.93.

Furthermore, we don't yet know how the evolution of AI will unwind, but most experts suggest the trend will only accelerate from here. As the leading provider of GPUs used for AI, Nvidia stands to reap the windfall from these secular tailwinds."", 'While much of the focus is on AI, there are a number of other opportunities that could drive Nvidia higher.', 'Chief among those is the gaming market. Many veteran and novice gamers upgraded to the latest and greatest processors during the pandemic. That, combined with the subsequent economic downturn, cratered demand for graphics cards in recent years. However, those gaming chips and the computers that house them are coming to the end of their useful life, which will act as a catalyst for the next upgrade cycle.', 'To close out 2023, Nvidia controlled an estimated 80% of the discrete desktop GPU market, and its graphics cards are still the gold standard for gamers.

It's little wonder then that those in the market for AI-centric GPUs are turning to Nvidia."", ""Nvidia's currently boasts a market cap of roughly $2.26 trillion, which means it will only take a stock price move of 33% to drive its value to $3 trillion. Given the company's multiple avenues for growth and the accelerating adoption of AI, it seems it's only a matter of time."", ""Given its meteoric rise over the past 17 months, any shortfall -- real or imagined -- in Nvidia's performance could crater the stock price, at least temporarily.

Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 3rd quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results.

And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan."", ""Lachlan Murdoch : Thank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. This quarter, FOX continued to distinguish itself from its peers delivering 7% EBITDA growth and demonstrating again the strength of our brands and the advantages of our strategy. This result is even more impressive when considering we are comping to last year's third quarter, which enjoyed a significant tailwind from Super Bowl 57. In the fiscal third quarter, total affiliate revenue fees grew 4% with positive growth at both our Television and Cable segments, driven by pricing benefits from our recent renewals. Headline advertising revenues were down during the quarter as expected, due to the absence of the Super Bowl and fewer NFL broadcast than in the prior year."", ""If not for the difference in our NFL postseason schedule, our total advertising revenues would have increased a few percent. Overall, advertising trends at FOX are clearly moving in the right direction, both in the scatter market and in early upfront discussions. Demand for sports remains robust, while trends at FOX News are improving across the board, including the fact that we have now fully lapped the direct response market issue that had adversely impacted FOX News PR revenues. And while there wasn't much of a primary season this year, we do expect strong political advertising for national and local races as well as local ballot issues in the first half of our fiscal '25 which would largely benefit our station group. As we look to our annual upfront presentation next week, our focus on live content and must-watch events, such as the coming presidential election cycle and next year's Super Bowl combined with Tobi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service will favor our enviable position with advertisers across the FOX portfolio."", ""Operationally, FOX News again ended the third quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and primetime. FOX News also strengthened its leadership position inside the category gaining share again, commands 50% of total debuting. These gains are underpinned by a dedicated team of journalists and staff who are focused on delivering coverage and insights on current events most relevant to our viewers. Building from our strength in primetime, we are expanding our leadership across day parts, whether that be mornings with FOX & Friends, afternoons with The Five or late nights with Gutfeld. And we expect this momentum to continue as we ramp action coverage heading into the fall. Tubi ended the third quarter with 22% revenue growth driven by a 36% increase in total view time and 20% growth in monthly active users to just under 80 million MAUs. Our expansive content library and our differentiated user base have solidified Tubi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the U.S. with 1.6% of total TV viewing, ahead of Peacock, MAX, The Roku Channel, Paramount+ and Pluto TV and only marginally behind Disney+."", ""Paramount's debut on the Nielsen Gauge in February of '23 to the most recent gauge in March of '24 to be share of total U.S. TV view time grew 60%, which is faster than any other streaming service over that same period of time. Apart from just its growing scale to be also unique and uniquely valuable to advertisers through its reach and through its engagement. Over 60% of Tubi users are classified as cord cutters or cord nevers and 90% of those user time watching is proactively on demand as opposed to passively watching a fast channel. This positions to be very well as an important part of the growing digital streaming advertising marketplace. We look forward to showcasing Tubi's strengths at next week's upfront. FOX Sports had an impressive quarter with strength across all areas of our portfolio."", ""We finished the 30th anniversary of the NFL on FOX on a high note with 3 NFC playoff games on FOX averaging an incredible 45 million viewers. This was capped with the NFC Championship game growing over 56 million viewers, which is 19% higher than last year's NFC Championship game and the most watched in over a decade. This season also reinforced FOX solid position in collar sports with strong viewers from both college football and college basketball. In fact, in the current academic year, FOX are the most watched college football, Men's College Basketball and women's college basketball games across the regular season. College Sports has grown to become the second biggest source of FOX viewership behind only the NFL. Total consumption of college sports on FOX has grown by over 40% through the last five years."", ""And in the March quarter, we launched the UFL, United Football League, the result of the merger of the USFL and XFL. With this merger, the outlook for spring football is promising, and we are pleased with the results through the midpoint of the season. While the sports calendar in our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter tends to be quieter, FOX Sports is excited to present its summer of soccer, featuring over 200 hours of live soccer coverage across our platform starting with the UEFA European Football Championship on June 14 and Copa America on June 20. This summer will also feature a new schedule from FOX Entertainment, with returning favorites like Gordon Ramsay's Food Stars and exciting new shows like the 1%. This follows a successful spring slate that featured two of the top five new primetime series in Krapopolis and the floor."", ""With Krapopolis, ranking as the number one new Primetime Entertainment Show and the floor as the number one game show season to date. Last quarter, we announced the formation of a new sports-focused digital distribution platform with our partners Disney and Warner Bros Discovery. We are happy to have hired truly a world-class CEO in Pete Distad and he is off to a flying start. In just several weeks, the JV now has over 150 engineers and executives dedicated to building a unique innovative product which focuses on sports fans outside of the traditional TV bundle. We've already launched an internal data service, which I have been trialing this past week, and I have to say it's an incredibly exciting product and we can't wait to launch it this fall."", ""Today's media market is certainly dynamic, but the strength and leadership of our brands and their capacity to convert those strengths financially underscores our considered strategy. Underpinned by our best-in-class balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and just 1 time net leverage. We remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful balance of managing our existing businesses, pursuing new adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Steve."", ""Steve Tomsic : Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX's strategy continues to deliver solid results. Even with the comparison to our blockbuster NFL schedule of the prior year, we posted total revenues of $3.45 billion and grew adjusted EBITDA by 7% to $891 million. Total company affiliate fee revenues grew 4% over the prior year with growth at both our Television and Cable segments, supported by a recent cycle of affiliate renewals. Reflecting the event-driven nature of our business, advertising revenues on a headline basis were down 34% as we compare against last year's broadcast of the Super Bowl, along with 2 less NFL playoff broadcasts in the current year quarter. As Lachlan just mentioned, if not for the impact of these NFL schedule items, total company advertising revenues would have grown low single digits."", ""Total company other revenues were down 22% versus the prior year primarily the result of the timing of sports of licensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter this year. Total company expenses fell 21% year-over-year primarily a result of the NFL postseason schedule differences I just mentioned. Net income attributable to stockholders of $666 million or $1.40 per share compared to the net loss of $54 million or negative $0.10 per share reported in the prior year period. This year-over-year variance reflects the growth in EBITDA as well as the absence of last year's FOX News Media litigation charge and a current quarter book gain on the merger transaction of the USFL which is now being deconsolidated in connection with the formation of the United Football League."", ""Excluding these and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 16% against last year's $0.94. Now let's turn to our segment results. At Cable, revenues were $1.47 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter, while EBITDA grew 3%. Cable affiliate fee revenues were up 1%, with growth in pricing from our distribution renewals outpacing the impact of -- from industry subscriber declines running in the mid-8% range. Cable advertising revenues fell by 6% or $20 million at the national sports networks, advertising revenues were down due to the absence of last year's Super Bowl-related programming, and the world baseball classic. At FOX News, ad revenues were impacted by moderating direct response pricing declines and lower digital traffic, partially offset by higher national pricing."", 'Cable other revenues decreased $89 million, primarily a result of the timing of sports sublicensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter. Cable expenses were 16% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the timing of the associated sports sublicensing expenses, lower costs at FOX News and the deconsolidation of the USFR. All in and despite segment revenues being down 6%, quarterly adjusted EBITDA at Cable grew 3% over the prior year quarter to reach $819 million. Turning to our Television segment, where revenues were $1.94 billion, down 22% from the prior year, while EBITDA increased 24%. TV affiliate fee revenues grew 9% over the prior year as price increases across our owned and operated as well as 30 FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from subscriber declines.', ""As mentioned previously, TV advertising revenues were impacted this quarter by the composition of our post-season NFL schedule, namely the absence of last year's Super Bowl and 2 less NFL playoff games. As a result, on a headline basis, TV advertising revenues were down 40%. TV Other revenues increased $30 million, primarily the result of the timing of deliveries from our entertainment production companies. While total TV revenues were down versus the prior year, this was more than offset by a 24% decrease in TV expenses. Expenses were lower in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the NFL schedule along with fewer hours of original drifted prime time content, including the impact of the industry labor disputes. All in, we delivered quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the TV segment of $145 million up 24% over the prior year quarter."", 'Turning to cash flow, where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.39 billion in the quarter reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming, coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. From a capital return perspective, from the commencement of the third quarter through today, we have repurchased $300 million under our share buyback program, along with returning nearly $125 million to our shareholders via our semiannual dividend payment. Our total cumulative buyback activity since the launch of the program in 2019 now amounts to $5.4 billion or 26% of our total shares outstanding and we remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization.', ""These capital return measures are supported by our robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in gross debt. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby to open the Q&A."", 'Gabrielle Brown : Great. Thanks, Steve.

These are well-known companies with long records of achievement, companies that have become household names – and offer investors the advantages of a known position and a reputation for reliability.', 'But even with the blue-chips, finding just the right stock can still be a challenge. The markets generate a vast flow of information, and that flood of info can be an intimidating barrier to making profitable stock picks. But that’s where the TipRanks Smart Score comes in.', 'The Smart Score is a sophisticated, AI-driven data tool designed to help investors make sense of the market’s raw data. The automated tool uses an algorithm based on natural language processing to gather, collate, and crunch the various indicators put up by millions of daily stock transactions – and then assigns each stock a simple score, on a scale of 1 to 10, to give investors a clear sign as to the stock’s likely forward course. The Score is calculated based on a comparison of each stock’s performance with eight factors known to correlate with future share price gains. A ‘Perfect 10,’ the best possible Smart Score, shows a stock that is primed for outperformance.', 'We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up a couple of Perfect 10s from the blue-chip universe; these are two names that tick all the right boxes – and that have earned solid recommendations from the Wall Street analysts. Here are the details.', 'The Walt Disney Company (DIS)', 'We’ll start with one of the entertainment industry’s biggest names, Walt Disney. Really, does the Mouse need any introduction? Disney was founded in 1923, and was quickly recognized as a leading innovator in animation, creating cartoons that children loved – as well as their parents. The company transitioned from silent films to ‘talkies’ in the late 1920s, releasing its first film with a soundtrack in 1928 – and that film, Steamboat Willie, also brought us Mickey Mouse. The rest is history.', 'That history has encompassed the company’s development of one of the entertainment world’s largest portfolios of assets and attractions. The company operates through three main segments, Disney Entertainment, ESPN, and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products. All three are well-known, and iconic in their own right.', 'Disney Entertainment includes the company’s content and media businesses – Disney Studios, Disney Streaming, Disney Platform Distribution, and what is probably the company’s single largest and best-known asset, the full library of Disney-owned films, everything from early animation dating to the 1920s to the more recent acquisitions such as the Star Wars, Marvel, and Indiana Jones film franchises. Disney’s movie library is widely considered to be the world’s single greatest such archive, at a level that few companies anywhere can even come close to matching. In addition to all of this, the company’s Entertainment segment is also the holding entity for Disney’s iconic characters and songs, and controls the associated marketing and spin-off products.', 'The company’s ESPN division comprises sports content and sports-related experiences, while Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products controls the eponymous theme parks, in Florida and California as well as internationally, along with the Disney cruise line plus assorted consumer products such as games and publications.', 'These business divisions are tied together by some of Disney’s strongest, and most intangible, assets – the company’s name and reputation. Few companies have reached Disney’s level of name recognition and branding success, making the name ‘Disney’ an asset that cannot be measured in purely fiscal terms.', 'Nevertheless, the stock has been under pressure recently on account of a mixed fiscal 2Q24 earnings report. Overall, Disney brought in $22.1 billion in revenue during the quarter, for a modest 1.3% year-over-year increase – but just sliding under the forecast by $50 million. The company’s bottom line earnings came to $1.21 per share by non-GAAP measures, a full dime better than the estimates.', 'However, despite streaming showing a solidly favorable shift in FQ2, the company provided a lukewarm forecast regarding streaming subscriber growth in the ongoing quarter and anticipated a slowdown in park visitations vs. the highest levels seen post-Covid, leaving investors disappointed with the print.', 'That said, in the eyes of Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne, Disney’s performance in Q2 bodes well for the future, and he says of the company, “Disney has the most direct consumer exposure among our large cap coverage group, primarily a function of its Experiences segment. We continue to see this business as uniquely valuable given its scale, growth, and ROIC characteristics… We remain optimistic that Disney can deliver nearly $1.5bn in DTC OI in FY25, ahead of consensus. The F2Q OI represented Disney’s first quarter of DTC profitability. We remain bullish with respect to its global pricing power, ability to manage expense growth, and benefit from password-sharing monetization.”', 'Swinburne goes on to rate DIS shares as Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $130 price target (lowered from $135) that indicates potential for 23% growth on the one-year horizon. (To watch Swinburne’s track record, click here)', 'The rest of the Street agrees with the MS take. This old-name blue-chip has 23 recent analyst reviews on record, including 22 to Buy against a single Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock has a trading price of $105.79, and its $134.81 average price target suggests a potential one-year upside of 27.5%. (See DIS stock forecast)', 'AT&T (T)', 'Next on our list is AT&T, another of the world’s iconic brands. This company is one of the most venerable telecom firms operating in the US communications market. AT&T boasts a market cap of $123 billion and generated over $122 billion in revenue last year. By market cap, AT&T is the fifth largest telecom firm globally, and fourth in the US; by revenue, the company ranks third globally and second in the US. The telecom firm has reached this scale by building itself up as the largest wireless service provider in the US. In addition to wireless networking and cell phone services, AT&T also offers internet services, digital television, and even landline telephone services.', 'This company has been closely connected to the national rollout of the new 5G networks, and has used the new wireless tech, and its own network, to introduce its Internet Air service. This is billed as reliable wireless internet coverage, delivered over the 5G network, with simple pricing plans, easy home network management, and internet security options available to protect customers’ systems. The company has also adapted Internet Air for the business customers, featuring low monthly rates, a reliable 5G connection network, and no speed caps or data caps.', 'All of AT&T’s business activity generated just over $30 billion in revenue for the company during 1Q24, a result that came in just under the prior-year value. The top line missed the analyst expectations by $510 million. At the bottom line, AT&T saw a GAAP EPS of 47 cents per share, 2 cents lower than had been anticipated. On a more positive note, AT&T showed solid cash generation during Q1, reporting $7.5 billion in cash from operating activities, up $900 million year-over-year, and a quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, for an impressive $2.1 billion y/y increase.', 'The company’s cash flow, along with the sound portfolio of services, brought this stock to the attention of Ivan Feinseth, 5-star analyst from Tigress Financial. Feinseth takes an upbeat view of this telecom giant, writing, “AT&T continues to build out an advanced diversified connectivity portfolio of increasingly resilient businesses and drive long-term growth. AT&T is experiencing early success with its recently introduced AT&T Internet Air, its targeted fixed wireless service, as it ramps up network coverage and rolls out its Internet Air for Business… We believe significant upside exists from current levels…”', 'For Feinseth, these comments back up a Buy rating on T, and his $29 price target implies that the shares will appreciate by 69% over the coming year. (To watch Feinseth’s track record, click here)', 'AT&T holds a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 11 recent recommendations that break down to 9 Buys and 2 Holds. The shares are currently priced at $17.17 and their $21.05 average price target suggests that T will gain 22.5% in the months ahead.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 84% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company."", 'Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.', 'In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Colgate-Palmolive.', ' See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ', 'Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', 'Colgate-Palmolive already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Colgate-Palmolive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.', ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Colgate-Palmolive. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.7%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.8% and 5.8% of the stock."", 'On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily."", 'The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count.

However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Colgate-Palmolive Company.

Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) is a buy, provided you share management's view on its capital allocation policy.

The company's adjusted FCF in the first quarter was $623 million."", 'You can think of the 70%, or $436 million, in the first quarter in terms of three buckets:', 'The fixed dividend of $0.22 per share accounted for $143 million in the first quarter.', 'The variable dividend, which was only $0.13 per share in the first quarter, accounted for $82 million.', 'An ongoing share buyback program accounted for $205 million in the first quarter.', 'Given that the last two are discretionary, it\'s clear that management is prioritizing share buybacks over the variable dividend right now. Indeed, CEO Rick Muncrief believes that the market is making that decision easy for him. According to Muncrief on the recent earnings call, ""Given that the equity market is still heavily discounting valuation to the energy sector, we plan to continue to prioritize share buybacks over the variable dividend to capture the incredible value that Devon offers at these historically low valuations.""', ""In other words, management believes the best use of shareholders' cash is to buy back stock, increasing the share of the claim on future cash flows for existing shareholders. As the chart below shows, management has steadily reduced the outstanding shares in issue by following a share buyback program. Since the $3 billion buyback program was initiated in 2021, Devon has repurchased $2.5 billion in stock."", ""It's a worthy strategy, but you should also believe a few things to support it."", ""First, you have to believe that the current price of oil is sustainable. If it isn't, and the price of oil drops to around $33 a barrel as it was in 2016, buying back stock using cash flow generated at the current price of oil to increase a claim on oil only valued at $33 a barrel doesn't make sense."", ""Second, you have to believe that Devon Energy will be able to increase reserves and production in the future. By using cash to make buybacks, you're still investing in the belief that the company will produce the oil and gas to benefit from increased prices."", ""If you aren't comfortable with both of these beliefs, the best use of FCF generated at the current price of oil is to return it through dividends and pay down debt."", ""It's not easy to predict the future direction of the price of oil. It suffices to argue that if you aren't comfortable with the oil price outlook, then it makes no sense to hold the stock. Some investors may well be buying Devon under the enticement of its trailing 4.8% dividend yield and potential to pay more, given its excellent FCF generation. Still, management has made it clear that it believes buybacks are the priority at the current stock price."", ""As for Devon's future production growth, the company pleased investors by raising its full-year production forecast to 655,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d) to 675,000 MBoe/d from a previous estimate of 650,000 MBoe/d on the back of a successful investment in improving well productivity in its core Delaware assets. Equally impressively, the production forecast increase doesn't imply any increase in its planned capital spending budget of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion."", 'At the time of the earnings report, management estimated it was on track to generate 9% of its market cap in FCF in 2024.

(NYSE:PX) had a good week, as its shares rose 8.3% to close at US$8.18 following the release of its first-quarter results. Results overall were respectable, with statutory earnings of US$0.04 per share roughly in line with what the analysts had forecast. Revenues of US$66m came in 3.4% ahead of analyst predictions. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for P10 ', ""Following the latest results, P10's six analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$265.6m in 2024. This would be an okay 6.0% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. P10 is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of US$0.16 per share. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$264.5m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.08 in 2024. Although the revenue estimates have not really changed, we can see there's been a sizeable expansion in earnings per share expectations, suggesting that the analysts have become more bullish after the latest result."", ""There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$10.00, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values P10 at US$12.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$9.00. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We would highlight that P10's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.1% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 30% p.a. growth over the last three years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.5% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while P10's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself."", ""The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards P10 following these results. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on P10. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have forecasts for P10 going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""And what about risks?

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag."", 'While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.', "" View our latest analysis for McDonald's "", 'The President, Christopher Kempczinski, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.6m worth of shares at a price of US$280 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$275. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.', ""Insiders in McDonald's didn't buy any shares in the last year.

This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap."", ""Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. McDonald's insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$418m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders."", ""Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying.

It's surprisingly kept pace with the S&P 500 for\xa0 many years and even outperformed the index when factoring in its dividends. Given the highly competitive, low-margin nature of the restaurant business, this is nothing short of incredible."", ""It's such a strong performance, in fact, that interested investors may be too intimidated to dive in even after the stock's modest pullback from January's high. The frothy price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of nearly 23 isn't exactly encouraging them, either."", ""This is one of those cases, however, where you might want to worry less about a stock's history and valuation, and worry more about the quality of the underlying company."", ""Don't misread the message. Valuations do matter."", ""They're not the only thing that matters when evaluating a stock, though. Just as important -- if not more important -- is the quality of the company in question. Has it proven it's built to last? Is the industry it's in a strong one? Does management truly understand what makes the organization tick and how to maximize its strengths while minimizing its weaknesses?"", 'In the case of McDonald\'s, the answer to all three questions is a resounding ""yes!"" The company as we know it today has been around for decades; there\'s a reason it\'s become the world\'s biggest restaurant chain during this time. And of course, people will always need to eat and will always need convenience. As for the organization\'s leadership, McDonald\'s CEO Chris Kempczinski may have only been at the helm since 2019, but he\'s led several different consumer-facing, food-related businesses during his career, including heading up McDonald\'s 14,000 domestic restaurants. Under his leadership, the restaurant chain is far more profitable now than it was prior to the pandemic.', ""Still, given the stock's steep run-up over the course of the past several years and the subsequently rich P/E ratio, is there enough upside left to justify the risk of jumping in now?"", ""Yes, there is. Here's why."", ""Picking stocks isn't necessarily complicated. But there's certainly an art to it -- an art that can only be taught by experience over time."", ""That's not to dismiss the numbers-based, scientific side of selecting stocks. Valuations are an obvious way of figuring out how much you're paying for a dollar's worth of earnings. They can help you compare similar (or dissimilar) stocks. Growth rates at least loosely suggest the sort of profits that will be in the cards in the future. You get the idea."", ""Mere numbers alone don't tell the whole story. Even without consciously knowing it, the market factors a company's qualitative attributes into its stock's price."", ""Re-enter McDonald's. Its stock is unusually expensive by broad market standards. But the market's pricing in a handful of details that don't show up on a balance sheet or its income statement."", ""The sheer power of the brand is chief among these details. The golden arches aren't just a logo. They invoke feelings of familiarity and comfort. They also stir hunger. The restaurant chain's choice of red and gold as its flagship colors is no coincidence either. These hues specifically invoke a feeling of happiness and at the same time accelerate heart rates. Of course, the restaurant chain has lifestyle-branded itself so aggressively for so long that many consumers now subconsciously connect these dots with just a passing exposure to the company's name, logo, or jingle."", ""Another detail justifying McDonald's stock's premium price is its sheer size. With more than 41,000 locales, the company is the world's biggest restaurant chain."", ""This in and of itself doesn't seem like a huge upside. Sure, it's bigger, but this size also makes it more complicated and costly to manage."", ""The company's turned its size into a competitive advantage though. In many ways, its footprint prevents rivals from setting up shop in prime locations, since McDonald's is already there."", ""Finally, what's not readily reflected in the restaurant chain's results is the nature of the business model. The parent company doesn't actually operate most McDonald's restaurants. Around 95% of the planet's McDonald's are run by franchisees. The parent company does own the buildings and property those franchisees operate from, however, and charges them ever-rising, market-based rent for the right to operate their business from that real estate. Although it's a growing point of contention among franchisees, for investors, this relationship supports a steady flow of dividend-driving cash flow."", ""These are qualities and characteristics no other restaurant chain exhibits. Moreover, these are qualities and characteristics that support the stock's premium valuation."", ""This isn't necessarily how every investor likes to pick stocks, especially newer investors. Many tend to like numbers and relative comparisons. And quantitative metrics certainly have their place. If nothing else, they help investors determine what likely lies ahead for a particular stock or indicate how the market might feel about a particular company in the future."", ""There's a seemingly arbitrary, qualitative side of stock-picking too, however, that relies on instinct and intuition. There has to be. Otherwise, all investors would buy and sell the same stocks at the same time."", ""More important to the matter at hand, McDonald's non-numerical attributes -- like its market position and its business model -- make it a stock worth owning under almost any circumstances. You should be willing to pay a premium for the quality it brings to the table."", ""So, no, it's not too late to buy McDonald's stock. If anything, the 11% pullback from January's peak is a buying opportunity. This selling suggests worry about waning demand from cash-strapped consumers. But this is just another cyclical headwind that will ease sooner or later, and likely sooner than later."", ""Before you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:"", ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and McDonald's wasn’t one of them.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of African architecture, you can directly go to 5 Countries with the Best Architecture in Africa.', 'African architecture is worth evaluating for a unique characteristic: a particular influence of climate and cultural influences on the way buildings are designed. A key example is the use of stone in both ancient and modern structures, as it is one of the most durable building materials available. Historically, traditional African architecture has kept in view the unique needs of the area’s residents.', 'A study on this subject was published in 2021 by Barabara Widera, an instructor of architecture from the Wrocław University of Science and Technology in Poland. The study found that during the hot season, 60-70% of the inhabitants of traditional dwellings found their homes to be thermally comfortable. However, in ‘modern houses,’ only 20% of inhabitants reported such comfort. During the cold seasons, comfort was reported by 90% of the inhabitants in traditional houses and only 50% of those who lived in modern housing.', 'The study identified four typographies of traditional houses, which had similar features across several African countries. The strategies that helped regulate the temperature within these dwellings included: thick mud brick walls to accumulate heat, small doors and a lack of windows to prevent heat from entering the home, and sustainable thatched roofs that provided adequate protection from the rain.', 'Africa has several countries with the best architecture in the world, which is showcased by the region’s widely famous buildings.\xa0 In 2021, BBC reported instances of iconic African architecture, as detailed in the seven-volume series ‘Sub-Saharan Africa: Architectural Guide.’ Examples included the Kasubi Tombs in Uganda, which were built in 1882. The Tombs serve as the burial grounds for members of the Baganda royal family, which makes it a significant site for the locals. The Guide notes that the interior has been made to resemble a sacred forest, having been topped by 52 circular rings. Each ring represents one of the 52 Buganda clans of the region.', 'Since the construction pre-dates the introduction of modern materials, the tombs heavily utilize traditional materials such as spear grass, wooden poles, and reeds. In 2001, UNESCO reported that the Tombs had been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2010, a fire caused heavy destruction to the place, following which UNESCO added it to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. The Kasubi Tombs were taken off the danger list in 2023. According to a report by TRT Afrika, the Tombs receive around 30,000 visitors annually.', 'The BBC report also highlights the Great Mosque of Djenné in Mali, which was built in the 13th century. According to the Guide, at a height of 52 feet, this mosque is the largest earth-built structure in the world. The construction has been done using sun-baked earth bricks and a coat of plaster along with sand and earth-based mortar. In 1988, UNESCO recognized the entire area of the Old Towns of Djenné as one of its Heritage Sites. The place was added to the List of Heritage Sites in Danger in 2016, where it still remains. Factors affecting the site in 2016 were civil unrest, housing issues, and land management. From 1981 to 2020, UNESCO approved seven requests of international assistance for the protection of the property, totaling $115,119 in funds.', 'Thriving architecture is one of the factors attracting tourists to a particular country. The phenomenon has been referred to as ‘architourism’ in academic circles. The relevance of architecture to tourism is pertinent to discuss here because tourism is a major industry in the African continent. According to a report by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), tourism contributed $186 billion to the African economy in 2019. A total of 84 million international travelers made their way to the continent that year. According to another report by Brookings, Africa had the world’s second-fastest-growing tourism sector before the pandemic. The industry represented 8.5% of the continent’s total GDP, employing 24 million people. Tourism-related employment was especially prominent in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, where the travel sector employed 8.4% and 9.2% of the total workforce, respectively.', 'However, the pandemic caused significant losses for the industry. From April to June 2020, the influx of international travelers in the region fell by 98%. Tourism-dependent economies such as Mauritius and Seychelles reported a sharp decline in economic growth, 14.9% and 12% respectively. In September 2020,\xa0 a study was published by educators from the University of Calabar, Nigeria. The study estimated that Africa was set to lose some 7.6 million tourism-related jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Nevertheless, Africa has managed to bounce back from the losses. On January 31, 2024, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) published a news issue on Africa. According to the report, by January 2024, international tourist arrivals to the continent had recovered to 96% of pre-pandemic levels. Certain sub-regions were even performing better than they were before the pandemic, such as North Africa, where tourist arrivals in 2023 were 8% higher than they were in 2019. An increase in tourist arrivals, as compared to pre-pandemic levels, was also seen in other countries such as Ethiopia (28%), Tanzania (19%), and Morocco (15%).', 'The report also revealed that from January to September 2023, Africa recovered 92% of pre-pandemic arrivals, while the global average was 84%. During these nine months, Africa was the world’s second-best-performing region in tourism. Throughout 2022, the continent also managed to recover 84% of its pre-pandemic tourism-related earnings. The world average for this indicator was 74%. Several countries managed to exceed pre-pandemic earnings by a significant number, including Seychelles (59%), Algeria (56%), and Ethiopia (49%).', 'Furthermore, in November 2023, WTTC reported that over the course of the next decade, the African tourism sector could add an additional $168 billion to the continent’s economy, while also creating more than 18 million new jobs. Based on these findings, the upcoming years are expected to see further growth in the tourism sector of Africa.', 'As international arrivals in Africa continue increasing, whether for architourism or cultural tourism, several companies are playing a huge role in accommodating these travelers, such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). On October 24, 2023, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported that it had pledged $500,000 to support sustainable tourism in Africa. The company also announced that it plans to expand its Entrepreneurship Academy to five new countries in Africa. The Academy is a development program that helps individuals from underrepresented communities to become hosts through the Airbnb platform. In 2022, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) contributed around $1.2 billion to the South African economy, supporting almost 50,000 jobs in the country.', 'Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) is another company that proves to be beneficial for tourists in Africa as it can be utilized to look up the most popular architectural monuments in the region. The online platform has around 12 million reviews for attractions and hotels in Africa, making it one of the best resources for tourism. African destinations have also earned awards from Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) for years. In 2022, Shadows of Africa, a safari operator in East Africa, announced that the company had won Tripadvisor, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TRIP) Travelers’ Choice Awards for nine years in a row.', 'As architourism continues rising and the tourism industry in Africa booms, here are 10 countries with the best architecture in Africa that you can plan to visit this year. You can also take a look at the Top 12 Companies for Architects in United States and the 15 Highest Paying Countries for Architects.', '10 Countries with the Best Architecture in Africa', 'Our Methodology', 'In order to compile this list of the 10 countries with the best architecture in Africa, we adopted a consensus approach. First, we consulted ten rankings and reports on the internet, shortlisting countries that appeared in at least 50% of our sources. Then, we ranked the countries according to the number of tourists they received in 2022. Our hypothesis is that countries with good architecture will attract a high number of tourists.

Despite being a contemporary shopping center, the building was constructed keeping the unique needs of the region in view. The design is perforated which enables the flow of light and ventilation. The exterior also resembles a traditional Ethiopian fabric, adding further symphony between the architecture and the region.', 'Tourist Arrivals (2022): 0.92 Million', 'Ghana is home to all six architectural typologies noted by Widera in her research. Key characteristics of the architecture include rectangular-shaped huts made out of mud. Ghana ranks seventh on our list of African countries with the best architecture.

Dating back to the late 1800s, the index tracks 30 of the most influential companies in the stock market and provides investors with a real-time pulse check on the health of the U.S. economy.', 'Although the index has its flaws, it can be an excellent place to unearth companies with solid financial footing and robust competitive advantages. Here are three Dow stocks you can confidently buy and hold for the long haul.', ""The first stock to buy and hold for the long haul is Visa (NYSE: V). Visa operates the world's largest payment network, processing over $14 trillion in total payment volume. This is nearly double that of its next closest competitor, Mastercard, and shows how much of a chokehold the payment giant has on the industry."", ""Over six decades, Visa has built up a network of merchants, customers, and banking partners, making it a staple in the payment processing business today. The company's broad customer base and trust among banks and merchants make it difficult to take down, giving the business an incredibly strong network effect."", 'The company partners with banks to offer branded cards and earns a fee whenever it processes transactions through its network. In return, it shares some of those fees with its banking partners.', ""Visa's banking partners hold on to the credit card loans, so Visa itself doesn't take on any credit risk. For this reason, Visa's business can be incredibly resilient and grow alongside economic growth and inflation, which results in increased spending in the economy. While this can make Visa more vulnerable during economic slowdowns, it positions the company well during economic expansions, which tend to last much longer."", 'Growing emerging market economies could be another tailwind for the business. According to Grand View Research, the global payment processing market is projected to grow by 14.5% annually through 2030, giving Visa excellent upside potential for long-term investors.', 'The next stock that can be an excellent holding for patient investors is JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). For the past couple of decades, JPMorgan Chase has proven to be one of the best-run banks in the U.S.', 'Under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan navigated the Subprime Mortgage Crisis in 2008, over a decade of ultra-low interest rates, the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent post-pandemic inflation, and the fastest pace of interest rate increases in over four decades. Today, the bank boasts over $3.4 trillion in assets, making it the largest bank in the U.S. by a long shot.', 'What has helped JPMorgan is its approach to managing its fortress balance sheet, managing the possible tail risks, and giving it flexibility when opportunities arise.', 'One example is the most recent inflationary environment that emerged a few years back. When many other banks were adding loans to their balance sheets, JPMorgan took a patient approach and effectively ""hoarded cash"" to prepare for the tail risk of higher-than-expected inflation and interest rates. This prudent approach paid off. JPMorgan emerged victorious last year when the federal government auctioned off First Republic Bank, which went under amid a slew of regional bank failures.', 'JPMorgan has a firm financial foundation, and its multi-pronged approach to managing risk and navigating economic turbulence makes it another stellar stock to own for the long haul.', ""The last stock on this list that can be an excellent long-term investment is American Express (NYSE: AXP). American Express is known for its iconic branding, positioning it as a luxury brand that customers associate with the finer things in life. It's like an exclusive club, and everyone wants in."", 'The Black Card (aka American Express Centurion Card) is an invite-only card that reportedly requires at least $500,000 to $1 million in annual spending to even be considered. The more widely available Platinum Card commands a $695 annual fee and offers perks and rewards from high-end travel providers, luxury hotels, airlines, and high-end clothing lines.', ""Like Visa, American Express earns a fee from merchants when it processes payments through its network. Unlike Visa, American Express holds on to the credit card loans it makes. This allows it to earn fees and interest income, which has been an excellent source of growth in today's higher-interest-rate environment."", 'Holding on to credit card loans also exposes American Express to possible losses through rising credit card delinquencies. However, it has an advantage in that its premium customer base can better weather economic downturns and high inflation.', ""American Express' branding and positioning have long interested Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, who has been invested in the stock since 1993. It is also why the company has grown so well with the U.S. economy and why American Express is another excellent stock to add to your long-term investment portfolio today."", 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

Pay attention to what Warren Buffett is buying. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, now owns several oil stocks. Two in particular are worth diving into now.', ""As of last quarter, Berkshire Hathaway held around 250 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) worth roughly $14 billion. Given that Occidental has a market share of only $57 billion, Berkshire's stake translates into nearly 25% ownership of the entire company."", ""Occidental has many things going for it in today's operating environment. Analysts at Scotiabank recently upgraded the stock to sector outperform with a price target of $90 per share. With the current stock price hovering just above $60, that would represent nearly 50% in total upside."", 'What is it about Occidental that Berkshire and Scotiabank like so much? The company is certainly primed to benefit from a ""higher-for-longer"" pricing environment for oil. Its $12 billion purchase of Permian Basin oil producer CrownRock, for example, is expected to generate $1 billion in free cash flow in year one based on $70-per-barrel crude.', ""Oil prices today are closer to $80 per barrel, and given political instability across many key regions of the world, there's reason to believe prices will remain elevated for some time. Much of Occidental's production, including CrownRock's assets, is in high-decline areas. But high oil prices should keep these assets highly profitable."", ""Occidental isn't just an upstream energy producer. It also owns stakes in value-added businesses like chemicals and refineries. Over the next several years, the company expects to free up another $1 billion in annual free cash flow due to cost savings related to its midstream and downstream assets, plus reductions to its total debt levels."", ""Keep in mind that Berkshire has owned Occidental stock since the first quarter of 2022, meaning the company has already produced huge gains on its investment. Still, it has yet to wind down its position, suggesting someone at Berkshire -- maybe even Buffett himself -- still thinks there's plenty of upside to go."", 'Berkshire is betting even more on Chevron (NYSE: CVX) stock than it is on Occidental. Its Chevron position is currently valued at nearly $19 billion. Berkshire has also owned its Chevron stake longer than its Occidental position, first purchasing shares back in 2020.', ""What makes Chevron worth a $19 billion investment? The biggest reason to love this company is for its operational excellence. All you need to do is plot Chevron's stock price against oil prices to get the picture. Over the past decade, oil prices have fallen by around 18%, yet Chevron stock has risen by nearly 100%."", ""There's clearly something special about a company that can add significant shareholder value over a time period in which the price of its main product deteriorates."", ""What exactly is Chevron doing so well? Its two main advantages come down to operational discipline and capital management. This year, for instance, its production profile is expected to grow by 4% to 7% thanks to rising productivity across both its Permian and Denver-Julesburg basin assets. Improved well performance is coming even as unit costs remain flat. This combination has helped Chevron's upstream earnings per barrel continually rise, from roughly $7 per barrel in 2019 to around $10 per barrel today."", ""Chevron's capital management, meanwhile, is exemplary, something Buffett no doubt admires. The company has demonstrated a strong ability to allocate shareholder capital, with impressive returns on capital employed that lead the oil majors. Management expects free cash flow to double from 2022 to 2027 all while repurchasing 3% to 6% of shares each year. As a bonus, the stock also delivers a 4% annual dividend."", 'Both Occidental and Chevron will face some operational challenges in the years to come. Occidental will be tasked with justifying its $12 billion acquisition of CrownRock, while Chevron is involved in its own takeover: a $53 billion all-stock deal for Hess.', 'But if oil prices remain where they are, both companies can be expected to do quite well.

By 1994, Berkshire had accumulated 400 million shares of the company for a total outlay of $1.3 billion.

Let's look at some reasons why you might want to follow Buffett into this holding."", 'Few consumer staples giants are expanding sales at a double-digit clip today, but Coke is one of the rare exceptions. The chain reported an 11% organic sales spike in late April, keeping growth about steady with the previous quarter. For context, PepsiCo\xa0announced just a 3% uptick.', 'Coke is faring better than its rivals, mainly thanks to competitive advantages like its massive scale, marketing prowess, and exposure to a wide variety of growth niches including energy drinks, teas, and waters.

And now, that income has grown to over $700 million a year, simply through the beverage giant\'s steady annual raises. ""We expect those checks are highly likely to grow,"" Buffett said.', ""Coke's most recent 5.4% dividend hike pushed the quarterly payout to $0.49 per share from $0.46 per share. That mid-February increase was the company's 62nd consecutive annual boost. Strong cash flow and rising earnings mean there's plenty of room for the company to keep increasing its dividend in 2025 and beyond."", ""Even the best business won't make a great investment if the stock price is too high when you purchase it. The good news is that investors don't face much risk here. Coke's shares have underperformed the market in the past year, falling 3%, while the S&P 500 has gained 25%.

I'd like to begin by welcoming Steve Closter to the call. Steve joined us in March as Chief Commercial Officer. He brings over 30 years of commercial experience to Syndax, which includes establishing winning teams and leading successful product launches. Steve is building on the excellent framework that was in place prior to his arrival, and we are already benefiting from his keen insights as we prepare for commercialization. In the quarter, we made significant progress on executing against our corporate strategy. As you can see on slide 3, we achieved several significant milestones this quarter, including securing priority review from the FDA for both revumenib NDA filing and the axatilimab BLA filing."", 'We also completed enrollment in the NPM1 AML cohort of Augment-101, pivotal trial, bringing us one step closer to expanding the market opportunity for revumenib. We look forward to reporting data from the initial trial in the fourth quarter of this year, which could serve as the basis for a supplemental NDA filing in the first half of 2025. These accomplishments set us up for an eventful 2024 that we expect will include two full US regulatory approvals, NPM1 pivotal data readout, additional combination data for recommended for revumenib in KMT2A and NPM1, initiation of a pivotal trial for revumenib in frontline KMT2A and NPM1 acute leukemia in combination with venetoclax, as well as the initiation of two combination trials for axatilimab in frontline chronic graft versus host disease.', 'As we approach our expected approvals, we are working to ensure that we are fully prepared to successfully launch at any time during the third quarter with an ability to reach all patients in need as rapidly as possible. Steve will provide additional details on our launch preparations later in the call. Syndax has a differentiated profile as a smid-cap biotech with two first and best-in-class drugs on the cusp of their potential first approvals. Notably, revumenib has a potential second significant indication and near-term expansion opportunity in relapsed or refractory NPM1 that meaningfully extends the target patient population in acute leukemia. This is unique in a launch year as it quickly broadens the market opportunity for revumenib in the relapsed or refractory setting to up to 6,500 patients.', ""Multiple opportunities beyond the initial relapse or refractory indication exists for both assets. And trials are ongoing that can drive significant long-term value for these franchises for years to come. We are well-funded with $522 million in cash as of March 31, that we expect will provide significant capital through 2026. Our current balance sheet not only supports our planned commercial launches and clinical trials, but also allows us to expand beyond our core registration indications and pursue select business development opportunities. I'll now ask Neil to provide an overview of the pipeline. Neil?"", 'Neil Gallagher: Thank you, Michael. In the first quarter, the NDA filing for revumenib of a highly selective menin inhibitor was granted priority review by the FDA for the treatment of adult and pediatric relapsed or refractory KMT2A rearranged or MT2Ar acute leukemia and issued a PDUFA date -- target date of September 26, 2024. The filing is being reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review, which provides a more efficient review process and has historically led to earlier approval . The submission is based on data from the pivotal AUGMENT-101 trial outlined on slide 4 where single-agent revumenib induced a high percentage of blastfree responses in heavily pretreated KMT2Ar acute leukemia patients, thereby, enabling many of them to undergo potentially curative stem cell transplant and to continue revumenib monotherapy following transplant.', ""We've also completed enrollment in the final pivotal cohort of the AUGMENT-101 trial of 64 adult relapsed refractory NPM1 AML patients in March and expect to report the pivotal results from this population in the fourth quarter of this year. I'll take a moment to review the Phase 1 data on slide 5 that underlines our confidence in the pivotal results for patients with relapsed or refractory NPM1 AML. Multiple presentations generated by us in both the relapsed or refractory and frontline settings have highlighted the consistency of menin inhibition across NPM1 mutations and KMT2A rearrangements, and we see the enthusiasm building for the revumenib in NPM1. The Phase 1 NPM1 data that we've reported supports our conviction that revumenib could be an important treatment for this AML population."", ""In the Phase 1 part of AUGMENT-101, 50% of NPM1 patients achieved an overall response and 36% achieved complete remission or CR with partial hematological recovery. And importantly, all patients with CR/CRh were MRD-negative. Consistent with the KMT2Ar population, revumenib also enabled a high percentage of NPM1 responders to proceed to transplant 43% and responses have been durable. This is despite many of the patients having failed prior venetoclax therapy and prior stem cell transplants. It's worth noting that revumenib has been well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory NPM1 AML. In the Phase 1, there were no Grade 4 or 5 QT prolongation events, no patient experienced greater than Grade 2 differentiation syndrome, and no patients discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events."", ""We believe that revumenib will form the backbone of treatment for patients who have both KMT2Ar and NPM1 acute leukemias. Our clinical strategy extends beyond the initial relapsed or refractory populations and into the frontline and post transplant maintenance settings, including combinations of approved therapies. We have several combination trials ongoing with different standards of care across the continuum of patients, including in the fit and unfit settings that are listed on slide 6. Investigators presented data from multiple Phase 1 combination trials, including Beat AML, SAVE AML, and AUGMENT-101 during the American Society of Hematology Conference in December, demonstrating revumenib's ability to safely and effectively combine with the standards of care."", 'We expect to provide updated data from these trials later this year. In the first quarter, we initiated another Phase 1 combination trial with standard-of-care intensive chemotherapy, also known as 7+3. Beyond acute leukemia, we are investigating the opportunity to expand to solid tumors. Our proof-of-concept signal seeking Phase 1 clinical trial in metastatic colorectal cancer is ongoing, and we expect to provide an update on the progress of the dose escalation phase of the trial later this quarter. Turning to axatilimab on slide 7. Also in the first quarter, the BLA filing for axatilimab or CSF-1R antibody was granted priority review by the FDA for the treatment of chronic graft versus host disease or chronic GVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy with the PDUFA date of August 28, 2024.', ""This submission is based on data from the pivotal AGAVE-201 trial for treatment with single-agent axatilimab led to an overall response rate or ORR of 74% with 60% of responders didn't respond for one year. Importantly, axatilimab has a differentiated mechanism of action from currently approved therapies for chronic GVHD. It is the first investigation of chronic GVHD agent to target inflammation and fibrosis through the inhibition of disease-associated macrophages. We're excited about the opportunity to expand axatilimab into the frontline setting in combination with standards of care and other fibrotic diseases where monocyte macrophage lineage plays a key role, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF, where we are currently enrolling a Phase 2 clinical trial."", ""The team has been working hard to increase awareness of the compelling regimen of AUGMENT-101 and the axatilimab AGAVE-201 data ahead of the respective potential approvals. In April, investigators presented pediatric data from AUGMENT-101 in a plenary session of the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology that further supports the consistency of the data across subgroups. Also in April, investigators presented additional analyses from AGAVE-201 at the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Congress highlighting axatilamab's impressive clinical activity in fibrosis-dominant organs, which, as I mentioned earlier, is a key point of differentiation. We have ambitious publication plan underway, and we look forward to detailing more of the clinical benefits of axatilimab and revumenib to the prescribing community."", ""I'll now turn the call over to Steve to talk about preparation for a planned commercial launches on the market opportunity. Steve?"", ""Steve Closter: Thank you, Neil. This is an exciting time to be at Syndax, and we're looking forward to launching two first-in-class and meaningfully differentiated agents this year. As Michael indicated earlier, we'll be ready to launch revumenib and axatilimab in the third quarter. And we've made significant progress so far this year to prepare ourselves in the market to realize the full potential of these medicines for patients or health care professionals and the company. Our key focus areas are highlighted on slide 8. Our pre-commercialization strategy has focused on developing an efficient, effective, and purpose-built infrastructure to support the business and prioritize relationships with important external stakeholders [Technical Difficulty] and the health care provider as well as the payer space to accelerate uptake at launch."", 'For revumenib, our prelaunch activities have been centered around disease awareness, mechanism of disease education, and market access, as well as ensuring patient support services are in place at the time of launch. The customer facing leadership team has been in the field for some time and focus on disease state awareness and building relationships with health care providers. The team is actively profiling accounts, understanding workflows and identifying the patient journey at the largest and most influential academic centers in the country. This has allowed us to have important conversations with health care providers and other health care organization decision makers and gained valuable insights on the market, which has helped us define our outreach strategy.', ""We launched a non-branded campaign last year, focused on improving the knowledge and understanding around the role of menin inhibition across key segments of acute leukemia, including KMT2A rearrangements, as well as follow-on indications like NPM1 AML. This effort will expand as we approach a potential launch. We've recruited a talented and highly experienced sales team with an average of 22 years of experience, primarily in hematology/oncology with an average of six product launches per representative. This is obviously a very experienced group with existing relationships and proven past success. The customer facing field team will play a multidisciplinary role in supporting health care professionals and patients. With regard to market access, our team has been educating commercial and Medicare payers on the burden of relapsed or refractory acute leukemia to prepare them to conduct timely and evidence-based reviews and ultimately access decisions upon potential FDA approval while formulary approval builds over time."", ""We have little doubt that revumenib will be covered for reimbursement, while plans to review the product for formulary inclusion. We've been meeting with pharmacy benefit managers and payers since 2023, sharing relevant market and product information and expect to reach plans covering more than 90% of all lives prior to revumenib's anticipated approval. Payers are telling us that they recognize the significant unmet need in KMT2Ar acute leukemia patients and the benefit that revumenib could provide as supported by the AUGMENT-101 data. This is important due to the acute nature of the disease and the high mortality and morbidity in relapsed or refractory KMT2Ar acute leukemia, making the urgency to treat quickly absolutely critical. I'm excited about our progress to date and look forward to sharing more about our ongoing efforts in the future."", ""Turning now to slide 9, KMT2Ar and NPM1 acute leukemias represent up to 40% of all AML patients. And there are no FDA approved targeted therapies for this population. We believe relapsed or refractory KMT2Ar acute leukemia alone represents a total addressable market of approximately $750 million in the US. The annual incidence of KMT2Ar acute leukemia is about 2,600 patients and the majority are refractory to front-line standard-of-care treatments. We estimate a median duration of therapy across the treated population of approximately nine months, and we believe the clinical data supports pricing competitively to other targeted therapies in AML, such as the FLT3 or IDH inhibitors. Physicians we've spoken with indicate an eagerness to prescribe revumenib early during an eligible patient's treatment journey to bring more patients to transplant and then extend responses by continuing with revumenib line of therapy following transplant engraftment."", ""We expect that our first mover advantage and the early experience physicians will gain treating patients with revumenib will be vitally important to the long-term success of our brand. Our significant market share is likely to extend meaningfully beyond KMT2Ar, especially as we will be the first to deliver meaningful pivotal data in other indications such as NPM1 AML. We estimate that the two distinct market segments in acute leukemias, KMT2Ar and NPM1 available accessible population of 5,000 to 6,500 patients in the relapse or refractory setting and an addressable market opportunity that approaches $2 billion in the US. Turning now to slide 10, approximately 14,000 US patients suffer from chronic GVHD, 50% of whom require treatment beyond second line due to disease progression, inadequate response, or disease manifestations that aren't wholly addressed with current treatments."", ""There are no cures for this advanced chronic GVHD patient population. Patients initially treated with corticosteroids are then cycled through a variety of additional therapies based on the physician's experience and manifestations of the disease being addressed. The successful commercial launches of Jakafi and , and importantly, the speed by which both these agents gained adoption really speak to the unmet need in chronic GVHD. We also know that despite these recent advances, the disease is still inadequately treated and physicians are looking for an agent that can better address the underlying fibrosis that ultimately leads to organ damage. Further, they are excited to have a drug with such a fast onset of action and impressive durability of response."", ""These key points of differentiation should enable axatilimab to carve out a sizable commercial opportunity within the estimated $1 billion US refractory chronic GVHD market. As you know, Incyte is our partner for axatilimab and really the leader in the GVHD space. As of last year, we exercised our option with Incyte to co-commercialize axatilimab in United States and provide 30% of the commercial efforts as we believe there is a considerable benefits of [indiscernible] two products simultaneously to a highly overlapping and targeted physician prescriber universe. We're working closely with Incyte to develop our go-to-market strategy for axatilimab and plan to align more fully with Incyte before sharing additional details. However, we expect to follow a similar set of strategic imperatives as we've just outlined for revumenib."", ""Now I'll turn the call over to Keith to review our financial results."", ""Keith Goldan: Thank you, Steve. Turning to slide 11, as Michael mentioned earlier, the $522 million in cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments on our balance sheet at March 31, expected to provide runway through 2026. Our financial strength allows us to appropriately invest to maximize the value of our pipeline, and importantly, to transition into a commercial stage organization this year. Turning to the income statement, operating expenses in the first quarter was $79.5 million, comprised of $56.5 million of research and development expense and $23.0 million of selling, general, and administrative expense. Keeping in mind that we've always embraced a disciplined approach to resource allocation, we'd like to provide financial guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2024."", 'For the second quarter, the company expects research and development expenses to be $50 million to $55 million and total operating expenses to be $80 million to $85 million. For the full year 2024, there is no change to the existing guidance, and the company continues to expect research and development expenses to be $240 million to $260 million and total operating expenses to be $355 million to $375 million. Note that the guidance range for operating expenses for the full year 2024 is inclusive of an estimated $43 million of non-cash stock compensation expense. And preparing for launch, I want to take a minute to lay out how we plan to recognize revenue for axatilimab. Slide 12 includes an illustrative example of accounting for sales of axatilimab and is not intended to provide any margin or other guidance.', ""Commercially, our partnership with Incyte is a 50/50 split of the economics in the US. We will report 50% of revenues earned, net of cost of sales and commercial expenses. During the period where there is a net commercial profit for axatilimab, as in the top example on this slide, our 50% share of the net profit will be recognized on our P&L as collaborative arrangement revenue. During a period where there's a net commercial loss for axatilimab, as in the bottom example on this slide, our 50% share of the net commercial loss would be included in operating expenses designated as a separate line item called share of collaboration loss. We also have various future US commercial and regulatory milestones owed to us from Incyte that would be recorded as partnership or milestone revenue on our income statement.Development expenses are shared 55/45 in the US and our 45% share is included in the income statement as part of R&D expense."", 'Outside of the US, Incyte is responsible for 100% for the development and regulatory expenses, and we are entitled to receive a milestones plus royalties on ex-US sales. With that, let me now turn the call back over to Michael.', ""Michael Metzger: Thank you, Keith. As you've heard during the call, 2024 is shaping up to be a historic year for Syndax as we prepare to launch two first-in-class products. And I'm confident that we have the expertise, resources, and determination to bring these products to market. As an organization, we are truly excited to evolve into a commercial organization, and we are laser focused on bringing these important treatment options to patients in need. On slide 13, we lay out our key upcoming milestones for the balance of the year, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months. As always, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Syndax team, our collaborators, and most importantly, the patients, trial sites, and investigators involved with our clinical programs."", ""Through our work and dedication, we are getting ever so close to delivering on our mission of improving the lives of patients with cancer. I'd also like to thank our committed, long-term investors who continue to share in our vision and support us in building Syndax. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Waste Management (NYSE:WM) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Waste Management:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.14 = US$4.0b ÷ (US$33b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""Therefore, Waste Management has an ROCE of 14%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10% generated by the Commercial Services industry."", ' See our latest analysis for Waste Management ', ""In the above chart we have measured Waste Management's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Waste Management  for free."", ""The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has employed 45% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 14%. 14% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Waste Management has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns."", ""The main thing to remember is that Waste Management has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 113% return they've received over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further."", ""On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Waste Management   you'll probably want to know about."", ""While Waste Management may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

If one believes that the correction in the broader indices such as the S&P 500 is only temporary, then the dividend yield paid by these companies increases, which increases one’s long-term income potential. One can then improve their cost basis and yield-on-cost (YoC) as dividends rise in the future.', 'However, a stock market crash may not be beneficial for these dividend stocks to avoid.

The S&P 500, for example, has done a wonderful job of bringing investors financial independence. But some businesses have performed even better than the broader market.', ""Take Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG). In the past 40 years, this consumer staples stock has produced a total return, including dividends, of 14,810%. That means a $10,000 investment would've turned into $1.5 million today."", ""Let's take a closer look at this company to see if it may be a good addition to your portfolio."", 'Since being founded in 1837, Procter & Gamble has had a long and storied history of dominating the consumer staples sector. It went from selling soap and candles to now offering a wide range of merchandise. Investors are familiar with its products, which range from Head & Shoulders shampoo and Crest toothpaste to Vicks medicine and Bounty paper towels. The company has more than 20 different products that alone generate at least $1 billion in annual revenue.', ""What's made this business a winner for investors is the simple fact that it experiences durable demand. Procter & Gamble doesn't operate in the tech sector, which registers rapid change. It sells boring things people need in their day-to-day lives. This also leads to repeat purchase behavior and customer loyalty."", ""An important attribute is that Procter & Gamble has proven pricing power. Warren Buffett argues that this is one of the top factors in assessing whether a business is good or not. Again, because the company sells essential products that consumers can't live without, Procter & Gamble is able to charge higher prices over time."", ""When you combine durable demand with pricing power, you get solid fundamental performance. Indeed, Procter & Gamble's revenue and net income have steadily climbed over the years. The growth hasn't been spectacular, but it has been consistent and long-running."", 'The gains have continued even more recently. Between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2023 (ended June 2023), the business reported annualized revenue growth of 4.2%. Diluted earnings per share rose at a compound annual rate of 9.8%. And during the latest fiscal quarter (ended March 31), Procter and Gamble generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow, which helps fuel its favorable capital allocation policy.', ""This business has undoubtedly rewarded its shareholders over the past few decades. But if we look out over the next five or 10 years, I believe the stock won't outperform the S&P 500."", ""One reason is because of the premium valuation. Procter & Gamble shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26.7. That's not only more expensive than the broader index, but it's a higher multiple than a company like Alphabet, which is arguably one of the highest-quality enterprises the world has ever seen with strong growth prospects."", ""Therefore, I think it's safe to say that Procter & Gamble is overvalued today. That's even more true when you consider that its sales are only projected to rise at a 3.4% yearly pace over the next three fiscal years, according to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates."", ""However, income-seeking investors should consider buying the stock. While the current dividend yield of 2.46% isn't anything to write home about, it's worth noting that Procter & Gamble has raised its quarterly payout in 68 straight years. Good luck finding a business with that type of track record.

Your meal began with the beef consommé and proceeded to sautéed breast of chicken in wine. Care for a fruit tartlet for dessert?', 'Today, if you’re flying coach, you’ll need to book a long-distance international flight or – maybe\xa0if you’re lucky – a coast-to-coast domestic one to receive a free meal. On shorter flights, you might get a choice of complementary Biscoff cookies or pretzels.', 'Airplane food has fallen\xa0a long way from the glory days of in-flight dining when meals were served on white tablecloths and stewardesses scrambled eggs in the air. Disappearing meals have joined a long list of pain points, inconveniences and cutbacks that fliers endure today.\xa0But industry cost-cutting isn’t the only reason your tartlet is gone. The end of in-flight dining for many passengers surprisingly rose out of big changes in government regulation, airplane design, in-flight movies, industry tax breaks, plus heightened health and safety concerns.', 'Airline safety protocols and regulations since September 11 have changed what types of cooking knives crews can work with in the air.\xa0Airplane galleys are smaller to allow for more passenger seats on a plane. And airlines don’t serve some foods, like peanuts, to protect people with allergies. Meals are often smaller, blander or non-existent.', '“Meal service was once a point of pride,” said Henry Harteveldt, who covers the travel industry for Atmosphere Research Group. Now, “the quality is so poor you have to wonder: Do airline executives actually have taste buds?”', 'Airlines have long looked for ways to cut food production costs and reduce meal preparation times for flight attendants on board. In one famous example during the 1980s, Robert Crandall, then the head of American Airlines, bragged about how removing just one olive from every salad saved the airline $40,000 a year.', 'Cost and speed became more important to airlines than how the food tastes ever since. Carriers like Singapore Airlines or Delta may have partnerships with Michelin-starred celebrity chefs, but most companies farm out their food to catering services who may prepare it hours ahead.', '“People are willing to trade food for low fares,” said Blaise Waguespack, a professor of airline marketing at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida.\xa0“Your ticket gets you the seat. And anything beyond the seat you pay for.”', 'Charging passengers for food on board – even just a few dollars for a sandwich, snack box or cheese plate - is also a way for airlines to save on taxes. Domestic airfares are subject to a 7.5% federal excise tax, but that tax doesn’t apply to baggage fees and on-board food, both of which are getting more expensive.', 'Food on planes has been around almost a century, ever since 1920s flight attendants handed out chewing gum to passengers to relieve pressure in their ears. Early airplanes bounced so much in flight that meals were served on paper plates, according to the Smithsonian.', 'For decades, the federal government regulated airfare and routes, so airlines tried to set themselves apart with service, food and the kind of luxury usually afforded cruise passengers – or a Bond villain.', 'Until 1978, when the airline industry was deregulated, the law required that every passenger got an entrée, two vegetables, a salad, dessert and a drink as part of their ticket price, according to the Smithsonian.', '“Delicious food adds to the enjoyment. It’s prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, where dishes can be cooked in five-minute ovens,” Pan Am advertised in a 1958 commercial.', 'During the 1960s and 1970s, airlines routinely installed sky-high kitchens on board and advertised their menus to draw customers. Beef was a business strategy.', '”Airlines competed on service and amenities. Meal service was a big focus of [competition] because entertainment options were more limited,” Harteveldt said. “Airlines would have teams of chefs, their own catering kitchens [and] advertising around food.”', 'As deregulation took hold, airlines cut ticket prices. But to make up for lost revenue, they cut back on food choices and other services as well.', 'The September 11 attacks accelerated the decline of free airline meals. Airlines faced a deep reduction in demand and slashed in-flight meal service in response. United, American Airlines, Delta and others announced sharp reductions in-flight meal service shortly after the attacks.', 'The last holdout, Continental Airlines, became the final major airline to end free domestic meals in economy class in 2010.', 'Airline meals had been the brunt of jokes and criticism for decades, but now people miss them. Few airline-industry experts see them coming back anytime soon in coach.', 'The reality is very different for business and first-class passengers.', 'Molly Brandt, the executive chef of culinary innovation for North America at in-flight catering company Gategroup, said that the “golden age for airline food is here.” It just depends on which airline you’re flying and category you’re in. “It’s broken down by cabin class,” she explained.', 'If you’re in first class on\xa0an American flight, for example, you may have a lunch choice of a Mediterranean bowl, chicken breast with mojo sauce, Poblano black bean rice and plantains or penne pasta with\xa0plant-based ragu and ricotta. For Delta, pick between the cheeseburger, the spinach and cheese agnolotti, or a Hempler’s smoked peppered chicken breast salad.', 'A handful of airlines even offer caviar to first class passengers.
