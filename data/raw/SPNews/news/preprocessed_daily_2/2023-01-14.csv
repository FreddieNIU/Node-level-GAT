The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.The ratings reflect Federated’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. The ratings also reflect the credit enhancement received from its ultimate parent, State Street Corporation (State Street) [NYSE: STT].This single-parent captive was formed and capitalized in 2019 as part of State Street’s alternative risk financing strategy in the wake of significant price firming in the insurance market. AM Best considers Federated’s business profile to be limited, and whose sole purpose is to take on specific risks related to its parent’s insurance programs. Being a relatively new company, Federated’s historical operating performance has yet to be determined. The operating performance assessment of adequate reflects AM Best’s neutral position until business matures and evolves. Consideration is also given to management’s projections and the ability to execute on these projections in conjunction with Federated’s overall mission and business plan.Lastly, the ratings include a level of credit enhancement from State Street, one of the world’s largest financial service organizations. AM Best believes that given the captive nature of the business being insured, the interests of State Street and Federated are aligned directly, and additional capital and financial flexibility are available if necessary.AM Best remains the leading rating agency of alternative risk transfer entities, with more than 200 such vehicles rated in the United States and throughout the world.

6,ee6f3a7b-cf84-3d18-893d-a77bfeaba880,STT,2023-01-14,State Street Corporation (STT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corporation-stt-expected-150003094.html,1673622003,STORY,"['STT', 'NTRS']","[State Street Corporation (STT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.05 billion, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for State Street Corporation?For State Street Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.58%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that State Street Corporation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that State Street Corporation would post earnings of $1.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.82, delivering a surprise of +1.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.State Street Corporation appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -4.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.76 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Northern Trust Corporation has been revised 4.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.82 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.84%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this nation's second-largest bank would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering a surprise of 2.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Bank of America , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, posted revenues of $24.53 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.89%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $22.06 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Bank of America shares have added about 4.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.7%.What's Next for Bank of America?While Bank of America has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Bank of America: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.88 on $25.75 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.59 on $103.13 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Banks - Major Regional is currently in the top 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, State Street Corporation (STT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.

10,269ae1ca-9c4a-31ef-8de7-478111375ac7,PVH,2023-01-14,Fast-paced Momentum Stock PVH (PVH) Is Still Trading at a Bargain,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fast-paced-momentum-stock-pvh-135001171.html,1673617801,STORY,['PVH'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and PVH (PVH) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 18.5% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PVH meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 77.4% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PVH is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 2.01. This indicates that the stock moves 101% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that PVH has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PVH earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PVH is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PVH is currently trading at 0.59 times its sales.

16,68d0267f-c827-3833-9fe4-b35c26b3d5fb,CTAS,2023-01-14,Cintas: Dividend Growth Perfected,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cintas-dividend-growth-perfected-151723668.html,1673623043,STORY,"['CTAS', '^GSPC']","[Dividend growth investors often flock to the Dividend Aristocrats as these companies are considered to be the gold standard when it comes to companies that increase dividends payments to shareholders. Membership is so exclusive in this group that there are just 65 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.One of the more impressive names in the Dividend Aristocrats is Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS), which has one of the highest and most consistent dividend growth rates in the market place. The stock has also vastly outperformed the market index over a long period of time.High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Cintas: Dividend Growth PerfectedThe last five years have seen shares of the company gain almost 177%. For comparison purposes, the S&amp;P 500 is up just 43% during this time. But beyond just the increase in share price is Cintas dividend growth history, which might make the company the perfect dividend growth stock in my view.Company background and recent resultsCintas offers a variety of services and products to customers, including corporate uniforms, restroom supplies, first aid equipment, fire protection and entrance mats. Uniform rental and facility services contribute the bulk of annual revenues, but safety equipment and uniform sales are also important to the top-line performance.The company has a vast customer pool of more than 1 million businesses globally. Major markets include North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia.Cintas reported results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2023 on Dec. 21, 2022. Revenue for the period grew 13.1% to $2.2 billion, which was $48 million more than analysts had expected. Earnings per share of $3.12 compared to $2.76 in the prior-year quarter and beat estimates by 9 cents.Organic growth for the quarter was up 12.8% as Cintas continues to see new customer wins.Story continuesHigher energy prices ticked up 10 basis points for the period, but the gross margin still expanded 100 basis points to 47%.Cintas has long been a growth company. Revenue has a compound annual growth rate of just under 7% over the last 10 fiscal years, according to Value Line. Bottom-line performance has been the real standout during this time as earnings per share have a CAGR of 18.1%. A lower share count has aided this growth, but net profit still compounded at 16% over the last decade as the profit margin more than doubled.This high level of growth is expected to continue. Following second-quarter results, management raised guidance for the fiscal year. The company now expects revenue of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion, up from $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion previously, and earnings per share of $12.50 to $12.80, up from $12.30 to $12.65 previously. At the midpoint, this represents growth of 10.9% and 12.1%, respectively, from the prior year.Dividend and valuation analysisCintas has a very high GF Score of 96 out of 100, which implies that the stock could see continued outperformance going forward based on historical studies conducted by GuruFocus. This score is driven by perfect scores on profitability and growth, a very high score on momentum and middling scores on value and financial strength.Cintas: Dividend Growth PerfectedCintas ability to grow its business over long periods of time has laid the groundwork for the company to become a Dividend Aristocrat. Shareholders have received a dividend raise for 40 consecutive years.Shares of Cintas yield just 1%, which is less than the average yield of the S&amp;P 500. The stock has never been a high yielder as the 10-year average is just 1.2%. Shares of Cintas dont offer much in the way of income, but that is partially because the stock price has increased so much over the past few years.Its the dividend growth, and not necessarily the yield, that I find attractive. The growth has been equal parts aggressive and consistent over long stretches of time. For example, the dividend has a CAGR of 24% over the past five years, which is above the 10-year CAGR of 22%. More recently, the dividend was increased 21% for the Sept. 15, 2022 payment date., slightly below the medium- and long-term averages.Despite the size and consistency of the dividend increase, future growth looks to be likely as well. The current annualized dividend of $4.60 would represent a payout ratio of just 36% for the fiscal year using company earnings estimates. This is just ahead of the 10-year average payout ratio of 28%, but not to a level where high dividend increases are likely to be pulled back. The most recent increase is a reflection of Cintas ability to continue to provide 20%+ raises every year.Free cash flow shows the same. Cintas has distributed $412 million of dividends over the last year while generating free cash flow of $1.2 billion for a payout ratio of 34%. This is nearly in-line with the average free cash flow payout ratio of 30% since fiscal year 2019.Shares of the company arent cheap at 35 times forward earnings, but double-digit earnings and dividend growth rarely are.That said, even with the gains in the stock over the past few years, Cintas appears to be just reasonably valued based on the GF Value chart.Cintas: Dividend Growth PerfectedWith a current share price of $446.23, Cintas has a price-to-GF-Value of 1.02, making it fairly valued based on GF Value.Final thoughtsCintas has a proven itself over the long-term in its ability to produce high levels of growth in its business. This has resulted in dividend increases that are often above 20% per year. This is widely unheard of as growth typically slows down as the dividend becomes larger.This hasnt been the case for Cintas as the earnings and free cash flow payout ratios still remain in a very healthy range. In fact, the most recent increase shows that shareholders can likely expect similar type raises in the future, especially given the projected growth in the business for fiscal year 2023. In this way, I believe Cintas is the perfect dividend growth stock because the increases have not shown any sign of slowing down.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

25,2a328086-96e6-3f77-99e0-c4e002a3573d,HBAN,2023-01-14,Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huntington-bancshares-hban-earnings-expected-150003805.html,1673622003,STORY,['HBAN'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis regional bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.95 billion, up 18.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.53% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Huntington Bancshares?For Huntington Bancshares, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.33%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Huntington Bancshares will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Huntington Bancshares would post earnings of $0.38 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.39, delivering a surprise of +2.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Huntington Bancshares appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, Commerce Bancshares (CBSH), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.03 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +14.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $396.63 million, up 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Commerce has been revised 0.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.23%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Commerce will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230113005241/en/While there are over 90 million families with pets in the U.S. today, less than 3% of those pets are insured. The company’s partnership with Charlie Brown’s iconic dog aims to change this by educating the nation’s pet parents about the benefits of pet protection for safeguarding their personal finances and improving animal well-being.""MetLife is committed to building a more confident future for our customers and their loved ones – which we know also means their pets,"" said Brian Jorgensen, head of Pet Insurance at MetLife. ""As we grow, we’ve engaged an old friend and perhaps one of the world’s most well-known pets, Snoopy, to ensure we’re furthering this mission by raising pet insurance visibility and education.""The benefits of MetLife Pet InsuranceAmid growing economic uncertainties, pet owners have faced rising care costs and difficult tradeoffs leading many to struggle financially. According to MetLife research, 84% of pet parents reported increased pet care costs in 2022, and another 50% were concerned rising costs will prevent them from being able to be a pet parent in the future. In addition to rising prices for routine care and pet necessities, pet parents can find themselves faced with exorbitant bills they cannot afford following emergency vet visits, surgeries, or long-term hospitalizations.Since introducing MetLife Pet Insurance in 2020, MetLife has become the leading pet health insurance provider in the workplace, offering affordable products with a range of unique features, including 24/7 vet access over virtual chat, family plans covering multiple pets under one policy, and no breed exclusions or upper age limits. Plans also offer chronic condition care, coverage for exam fees, and no lifetime or per-incident limits. This extensive coverage means pets can get the care they need to live long, healthy lives – and pet parents can remain worry-free about affording their pet’s care.Story continuesAccessing pet insurance can be as simple as visiting www.metlife.com/petinsurance or reviewing the benefits offered at work. Employers are increasingly making pet health insurance available to employees to support the well-being of all family members and this distribution channel is projected to grow. According to MetLife’s 20th Annual Employee Benefit Trends Study (EBTS), 65% of employees with pets are currently interested in their employer offering pet insurance.The mission to increase pet insurance awarenessMetLife and Snoopy had a more than 30-year partnership through 2016. MetLife entered the pet insurance category in 2020, prompting a review of how to best address the need for consumer recognition of this fast-emerging category. Establishing a new relationship with the beloved beagle was a clear solution to addressing the significant need for driving awareness and understanding in the marketplace.""We are excited to reconnect with our friends at MetLife to focus on this new effort to drive awareness of pet insurance in the U.S.,"" said Tim Erickson, executive vice president, Peanuts Worldwide. ""The power of the Peanuts characters – especially Snoopy – endures, and we feel confident they will lend a helping hand to MetLife's Pet Insurance endeavors.""""Pet insurance protects pet owners against the unexpected – which means pets get the care they need, and pet parents can stay worry-free. The challenge is that not enough people know this benefit exists in their company plan,"" said Jorgensen. ""The interest is there – our research proves it. But there’s a clear lack of understanding of what pet insurance can do or help cover. This partnership aims to change that.""About MetLifeMetLife, Inc.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Carimin Petroleum Berhad's (KLSE:CARIMIN) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Carimin Petroleum Berhad:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = RM19m ÷ (RM300m - RM119m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Carimin Petroleum Berhad has an ROCE of 11%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Energy Services industry average of 8.4% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Carimin Petroleum Berhad roceHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Carimin Petroleum Berhad's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you'd like to look at how Carimin Petroleum Berhad has performed in the past in other metrics, you can view this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.The Trend Of ROCECarimin Petroleum Berhad has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 5,777% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesFor the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. The current liabilities has increased to 40% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.Our Take On Carimin Petroleum Berhad's ROCETo sum it up, Carimin Petroleum Berhad is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Since the stock has returned a solid 76% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Carimin Petroleum Berhad does have some risks though, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Carimin Petroleum Berhad  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Exxon has previously said the unit will start production in the first quarter of this year.""Construction of the new crude unit is completed. We have initiated startup procedures and commissioning is underway,"" said Exxon spokesperson Chevalier Gray in an emailed statement. ""The unit will add 250,000 barrels per day of all new supply for the refined products market.""U.S. stockpiles of diesel and gasoline are near five-year lows, and profit margins for producing motor fuels in the U.S. Gulf Coast region are near record levels.Refiners are earning about $35.40 per barrel using the industry's crack spread, a profit measure which compares the cost of crude oil to sale prices for gasoline and diesel, according to Refinitiv.""Right now, margins are sensational,"" said Garfield Miller, president of refining investment banker Aegis Energy Advisers Corp. ""These margins tell you that as far as the U.S. Gulf Coast is concerned, there is plenty of demand relative to supply.""SHALE OIL TO DIESELThe new CDU, called BLADE for the Beaumont Light Atmospheric Distillation Expansion project, was under consideration as early as 2014 and formally approved in 2019. It is planned to process Exxon's crude oil pumped from the Permian shale field in West Texas and New Mexico.Story continuesExxon said on Friday the total cost of BLADE is $2 billion. In a filing posted on Sept. 28 with the Texas Comptroller's office in support of property tax reductions, the company said its total cumulative investment was $1.2 billion.Turning on the new equipment will not immediately generate big new volumes of gasoline and diesel. Exxon plans to bring the new CDU up slowly to deal with potential startup problems, the people said.The new CDU, which will be the third at Beaumont, will increase the refinery's capacity by 68%. CDUs do the initial work of turning crude into feedstocks for all other units at the refinery.BLADE was constructed from modular sections over four years, a period that included the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020's massive decline in motor fuel demand that led to a record annual loss for the No. 1 U.S. oil firm.Operators at the Beaumont refinery this week were purging the new CDU of air in preparation to introduce its first crude, the people familiar with the matter said.The new CDU will make up for the refining capacity to be lost at the end of this year when Lyondell Basell Industries shutters its 263,776 bpd Houston refinery, said analysts.“Up until COVID, the U.S. added the equivalent of a world scale refining facility to existing capacity every year through expansions, de-bottlenecking, and tweaks,” Aegis Energy Advisers' Miller said.Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, six U.S. crude oil refineries have closed dropping U.S. capacity from 18.98 million bpd to 17.9 million bpd, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration report issued in June.POST-PANDEMIC MILESTONEExxon's Beaumont expansion marks a return to an era of steady refining capacity gains through processing tweaks and adding new equipment to existing plants.There are several major oil companies adding refineries outside the United States, said Matthew Blair, managing director of refiners, chemicals and renewable fuels research at energy banking firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Co.“Overall, there are quite a number of new refineries on the docket this year,” Blair said, citing projects in Kuwait, Mexico, Nigeria and China.“This will help rebalance global markets and bring down product cracks,” he added, using the industry term for processing margins.(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

However,  in 2023 demand for coal may suffer due to lesser coal utilization in the United States to produce electricity, planned retirement of coal units and utilization of more renewable sources for electricity generation. The ongoing transition, with utility operators steadily phasing out coal units, will adversely impact the coal industry. Then again, the persisting conflict between Russia and Ukraine is creating fresh demand from coal-importing countries. Hence, coal export from the United States is expected to improve in 2023 from the year-ago level.Even in case of a drop in coal production, low-cost coal producers like Peabody Energy Corporation BTU should benefit from their met coal and thermal coal production. With improvement in global steel production Alliance Resource Partners L.P. ARLP , CONSOL Energy CEIX and Warrior Met Col Inc. HCC are expected to gain.About the IndustryThe Zacks Coal industry comprises companies involved in the discovery and mining of coal. Coal is mined by either the opencast or the underground method. The commodity is valued for its energy content and used worldwide to generate electricity, and manufacture steel and cement. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report, the current U.S. estimated recoverable coal reserves are about 252 billion short tons, of which about 58% is underground mineable coal. Given the current production rates, coal resources are likely to last many more years. Five states in the United States contribute nearly 70% of yearly production and 60% of coal production from surface mining. Per EIA, the demand for coal will decline due to the usage of more renewable assets and a gradual shutdown of coal-powered generation units, hurting the prospects of the coal industry.3 Trends Likely to Impact the Coal IndustryNew Emission Policy to Hurt Coal Industry: The improvement in demand for coal is short-lived as the new environmental policy will target 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, which will significantly lower the demand for coal from the U.S. electricity space. Per EIA, coal-fired electricity generation would drop from 20% in 2022 to 18% in 2023 and further drop to 17% in 2024. Unless utility operators invest heavily in pollution-control measures to reduce emissions from power plants, domestic coal usage would fall significantly. Going forward, coal industry operators are likely to face many difficulties as a number of electric utilities have decided to become carbon neutral by 2050 and completely cut down coal usage. Per EIA, total coal consumption in the United States will drop 12.2% in 2023 to 458.5 MMst and further by 3.2% to 444.1 MMst in 2024.U.S. Coal Production Drops: As per EIA projection, coal production in the United States is expected to drop in 2023 and 2024 after showing an improvement in production volumes in the previous two years. EIA projects U.S. coal production to likely to decline by 11% to about 530 million short tons (MMst) in 2023 and a further 6% to 500 MMst in 2024 was due to an 11% reduction in coal consumption in the electric power sector in 2023 and a further reduction of 3% in 2024. This would hurt coal operators fighting a tough battle with the other sources of energy.Coal to Benefit From Rising Exports: The coal operators can benefit from the expected rise in coal export volumes. Coal, due to its economical prices compared to other energy sources, is still a viable energy option for many crucial industries across the globe. Per EIA, coal export volume may drop by 1.3% in 2023 to 83.3 MMst but would increase by 11.2% to 92.6 MMst in 2024. Steel production requires a lot of high-quality coal, and nearly 70% of global steel production depends on coal. The World Steel Association revised its 2023 steel demand outlook and now expects steel volumes to improve by 1% in 2023 to 1814.7 Mt. This expectation is lower than the prior expectation due to high inflation and rising interest rates globally, which may adversely impact coal export volumes in 2023. However, with the continued recovery in steel production, coal exports are expected to pick up from the end of 2023.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Coal industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil and Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #232, which places it in the bottom 7% out of 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong performance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since September 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have gone down by 24.2%.Before we present a few coal stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Coal industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the Zacks Oil and Gas sector over the past 12 months.The stocks in the coal industry have gained 54.4% compared with the Zacks Oil-Energy sector’s growth of 21.3%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has declined 16% in the same time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceCoal Industry's Current ValuationSince coal companies have a lot of debt on their balance sheet, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio.The industry is currently trading at a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.45X compared with the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s 12.03X and the sector’s 3.23X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 7.6X, as low as 2.34X and at the median of 4.8X.Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio vs S&amp;P 500Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio vs Sector4 Coal Industry Stocks to Keep a Close Watch OnPeabody Energy: St Louis, MO-based Peabody Energy engages in the coal mining business and has both thermal and metallurgical operations. In 2021, nearly 26% of the company’s revenues were derived from five customers with whom it still has 17 coal supply agreements (excluding trading and brokerage transactions) expiring at various periods from 2022 to 2026. This assures a steady flow of revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Peabody Energy’s 2022 earnings and revenues suggests a year-over-year rise of 118% and 34.3%, respectively.  The stock has gained 106.3% over the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 52.8%.Peabody Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The UAE is an OPEC oil producer that is sharpening its focus on the gas market as Europe seeks to replace Russian energy imports after supply cuts since Western sanctions were imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.The Qatari minister said he believed that Russian gas would eventually return to Europe.UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei, speaking on the same panel in Abu Dhabi, agreed that ""for a very long time, gas will be there"" and that while more renewable energy would be installed, more investment was needed in gas as a base load.""The whole world needs to think of resources and how to enable companies to produce more gas to make it available and affordable,"" Mazrouei said.Kaabi said it was unfair for some in the West as part of its green energy push to say African countries should not be drilling for oil and gas when it was important for their economies and the world needed more supply.Mazrouei said the ""unclear"" strategy of many countries made it difficult for them to commit to long-term gas contracts which in turn made it hard for energy companies to secure financing to invest in developing production capacity.Story continuesAs competition for LNG heated up, Germany last year struck a 15-year supply deal for Qatar LNG from 2026, the first of its kind to Europe from Qatar's North Field expansion project. QatarEnergy had signed a 27-year deal to supply China's Sinopec.Kaabi, who is also CEO of QatarEnergy, said negotiations were taking place with many players around the world.""There are a lot of European and Asian buyers, and there is a potential that by the end of the year, the entire Qatar expansion will be sold out,"" he said.Qatar's two-phase North Field expansion plan includes six LNG trains that will ramp up its liquefaction capacity from 77 million tonnes per annum to 126 million tonnes by 2027.(Reporting by Yousef Saba and Rachna Uppal; Writing by Ghaida Ghantous; Editing by Tom Hogue and Mark Heinrich)]"

CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa took a closer look at Bonk Inu:This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Called Bonk Inu, the project with a cute dog holding a bat as a mascot, launched with just a homepage and a “bonk paper” in the final weeks of 2022.But the lack of clear team information or even a dedicated community channel didn’t deter entrants from punting their hopes: The project’s token, BONK, ran up as much as 3,200% in just three weeks, almost single-handedly inciting activity in the Solana ecosystem, as previously reported.Bonk Inu is a team of 22 individuals with no singular leader, all of whom were involved in the inception of the project, CoinDesk learned from one of the several developers. All of them have previously built decentralized applications (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT) and other related products on Solana.The bonk airdrop – amounting to 50% of its token supply – likely drove massive community interest and instant hype. Some 20% of the total airdrop supply is going to Solana non-fungible token collections – comprising 297,000 individual NFTs – and 10% to Solana-focused artists and collectors. Airdrops refer to an unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses and are generally used as a tactic to gain users.Following Solana taking a hit after the FTX’s collapse, the 22 Solana developers wasted no time in distancing themselves from Sam Bankman-Fried’s dirt. They banded together to build a “community coin” – and decided that a dog-themed protocol was the way to go.The team does not see itself as a dogecoin or shiba inu rival and points out BONK is already different from the gazillions of dog-themed meme coins already on the market.Story continuesToken RoundupBitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value held strong at $19,800 Friday, rising 5% for the day and 15.7% for the week – the best weekly performance since March.

These areas often serve as levels of support and/or resistance, and help explain why BTC prices were mired between $16,000 and $17,000 for so long.Point two is illustrated via the BTC’s current Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 84. The RSI is a momentum indicator ranging from 0 to 100. Readings of 30 and below imply that an asset is overpriced. By contrast, readings of 70 and above imply that an asset may be overpriced.BTC’s current reading is its highest reading since January 2021. Since 2018, BTC’s RSI has been higher than 84 just 25 times. This isn’t to say that an asset can’t stay overbought for extended periods. The 91 RSI level reached on Jan 8, 2021, was followed by a 15% increase in price 30 days later.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Carimin Petroleum Berhad's (KLSE:CARIMIN) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Carimin Petroleum Berhad:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = RM19m ÷ (RM300m - RM119m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Carimin Petroleum Berhad has an ROCE of 11%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Energy Services industry average of 8.4% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Carimin Petroleum Berhad roceHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Carimin Petroleum Berhad's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you'd like to look at how Carimin Petroleum Berhad has performed in the past in other metrics, you can view this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.The Trend Of ROCECarimin Petroleum Berhad has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 5,777% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesFor the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. The current liabilities has increased to 40% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.Our Take On Carimin Petroleum Berhad's ROCETo sum it up, Carimin Petroleum Berhad is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Since the stock has returned a solid 76% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Carimin Petroleum Berhad does have some risks though, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Carimin Petroleum Berhad  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

It has pledged to stop deforestation in the Amazon, a vital biome whose health is considered vital in the fight against climate change. (Reporting by Marta Nogueira; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

And with Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year pushing prices into the stratosphere, producers kept adding drilling rigs.A warmer-than-expected start to the winter and the cooling of exports to Europe as inventories filled has cut U.S. futures prices by more than half since November, causing drillers to reduce the number of rigs drilling for gas to their lowest since May.""2023 is gearing up to be oversupplied by more than 5.0 bcfd(billion cubic feet per day), which justifies the downward trend in prices,"" said Ryan Smith, a senior director at energy consulting firm East Daley Capital.One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day.Gas futures at the Henry hub benchmark in Louisiana dropped from a recent high of $7.11 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in mid-December to $3.51 on Friday.That 51% price plunge over the past four weeks, the lack of enough pipeline capacity out of West Texas, and a projected decline in U.S. domestic gas consumption in 2023 and 2024 is forcing energy companies to rethink their outlook.Production is expected to climb to 100.3 bcfd this year and 102.3 bcfd next year from a record 98.0 bcfd last year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said this week.In November, shale gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp said it would rethink how much activity it would support if gas prices fell this year to $4 per mmBtu. As prices crossed that level, Chief Executive Nick Dell'Osso told investors this month it expected to reduce activity levels at prices in the mid-to-low $3 level.Story continuesThe EIA said the combination of falling domestic gas use and rising exports should keep total U.S. gas demand steady near 2022's record high in 2023 and 2024, even as production rises.One concern: rising production without much growth in demand could push U.S. gas storage toward peak capacity of around 4.2-4.3 trillion cubic feet by the second half of 2024, analysts at investment bank Mizuho told customers in a report this week.""The natural gas price plunge may throttle new production gains into the back half of the year - but any effect on 2023 pricing is likely to be marginal,"" said Eli Rubin, senior energy analysts at energy consulting firm EBW Analytics Group.

The special amenities include an on-site fitness center, five technology-enabled meeting rooms and two restaurants (one rooftop). The hotel is located near Westminster, which houses landmarks like the Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square and Big Ben, with Vauxhall as the nearby station for hassle-free transportation.Regarding the opening, Felicity Black-Roberts, vice president of development of Hyatt Europe, said, “London remains a priority market for our planned brand growth in the U.K., and we are delighted to add Hyatt Regency London Albert Embankment to our expanding list of properties in the capital.”Expansion to Drive GrowthThe company focuses on expansions across continents to drive business growth.

Also, focus on new hotel openings and acquisition initiatives bode well. As the pandemic has been subsiding, travel restrictions have been eased.

But that's what happened at the Dow Jones offices this week.News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson sent a note to staff on Thursday echoing demands for employees to return to the office—headquartered in Midtown New York—at least three days a week. The memo, leaked to Insider and in which Thomson called in-office attendance ""an absolute imperative,"" came the day after Dow Jones laid off a reported 2% of staff, including 22 union-represented employees.News Corp. declined to comment at this time.https://twitter.com/swodinsky/status/1613211102208204800Dow Jones is a division of News Corp. and operates the likes of the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, and MarketWatch. All the aforementioned publications, including the New York Post, are housed in the same building at 1211 Avenue of the Americas.The Wall Street Journal, which has followed the moves of its peer publication across Times Square, separately drew a line in the sand on RTO plans in September after the New York Times’ own RTO mandates floundered. The Journal told staff they would be expected to return to the office three days a week starting Nov. 1.It's rather apparent that hasn't happened to the extent the company hoped, because in Thomson's note this week, he called on executives across the entire company to consult with managers who would be expected to ""ensure full compliance.""""There is some room for flexibility in the work environment, but that flexibility is not boundless,"" he added.It should also be noted that News Corp.'s latest push to get folks back to their desks comes after it just renewed its lease agreement for its Midtown headquarters.Story continuesThe forceful hand of RTO mandate after laying off somewhere between 120 and 150 people isn't exactly a cheery message.Companies have tried to entice employees back with pizza, lunch boxes, happy hours, and any number of corporate out-of-touch isms. Thomson leaned heavily into the idea of a lost company culture and the idea that ""screens deny us the subtleties of body language and the nuances of knowing glances. The spontaneity and serendipity of a dynamic office environment.""Gallup consultants Nikki Morin and Heather Barrett wrote last year about the idea that bringing employees physically together cultivates some sort of important social bond that simply can't be replicated in a digital, virtual world.“The reality,"" they wrote, ""is that the office never equaled culture.

""I believe that the majority of digital content is going to start to be produced by AI.

""Generative AI can create across all media, so text, video, audio, pictures – every digital medium can be powered by generative AI.

""Although that's a fantastic story, there's no doubt Google is developing its own generative AI tools with the amount of data that they have, the amount of data they have.""Though it's complicated, the extent to which ChatGPT in its current form is a viable Google competitor, there's little doubt of the possibilities. Meanwhile, Microsoft already has invested $1 billion in OpenAI, and there's talk of further investment from the enterprise tech giant, which owns search engine Bing. The company is reportedly looking to invest another $10 billion in OpenAI.Ultimately, look for the generative AI space to start changing fast.""The pace of acceleration is so incredible that these tools – which are shocking and awing us at the beginning of 2023 – are going to seem quite quaint by the end of the year because the capabilities are just going to increase so powerfully,"" Schick said.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

I am Rachelle Akuffo, alongside Brad Smith. Now, a recent ""New York Times"" op-ed from Paul Krugman has taken aim at Elon Musk over increasingly shifting the perception of the Tesla brand from a plaything of the rich and woke to an emblem of Silicon Valley excess and Elon Musk's shift to the right. I discussed the impact of Musk on his brands with Nobel-- with the Nobel laureate and ""New York Times"" columnist. Take a listen.PAUL KRUGMAN: Yeah, and this is not a judgment on the quality of Teslas or on the quality of Elon Musk as a manager. You know, leave that-- I'm not a car guy, and I'm not going to try and give you my own opinions on the cars themselves. But the point is that this is an auto company. It's an electric vehicle company. But it's not the kind of company where you can expect an early mover, which Tesla has clearly been, to establish a sort of, you know, unchallengable monopoly position.This is-- Tesla is not going to be Microsoft, even if everything goes the way it should. It's not going to be Apple. This is not a network externalities, as the economist's jargon, where basically people use something because everybody else is using it, and it's very hard to break out of it. And so you get decades of extremely high profits. The car industry is not like that, and this is fundamentally the car industry.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, I mean, this is an increasingly crowded market, the EV space. And on top of that, I mean, a lot of people don't want to spend this kind of money. So we're not sure what that means for Musk at the end of the day. But you brought up Microsoft and Apple. And any time there's some sort of tech great, there's always going to be those comparisons to a Steve Jobs. But obviously, Steve Jobs had laser focus and a lot of discipline. So when you look at Elon Musk and the sort of culture that he's bringing into the company, what do you make of those comparisons?Story continuesPAUL KRUGMAN: Yeah. No, again, I have no inside information on how much Musk's other interests are affecting the management of the company, though it's not a good sign. But yes, Jobs had a vision. And also, let me say that at least a certain point, it mattered that Steve Jobs was perceived as a really cool guy, as somebody who-- you know, there was a certain-- you know, the guy in the black turtleneck and jeans with an amazing device in his hand, that was something that people wanted to buy into, which helped to establish his position.Now you have Musk, who, for a while, had something like the same image. You know, he takes us to outer space, he's-- and does interesting things. But he's now hurt that image. And that's-- again, I don't think-- and crucially, I don't think even if Musk had been as disciplined as Steve Jobs was, that Tesla was ever going to be a sustained profit machine the way that Apple has been. It's just-- it's not his fault. It's just not that kind of industry. But then, you know, the-- I don't know anyone who's done as much to hurt his image of cool in as short a time as Musk has done.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And it does raise that existential question, what does it actually mean to be a Tesla owner now versus when it first started? You had a lot of Democrats following along. You had a lot of liberal elite following along. And then as Musk got more political, as he sort of was more right-leaning, he became more vocal on Twitter, that seemed-- that narrative seemed to change. What does it mean now to be a Tesla owner?PAUL KRUGMAN: Well, that's a good question. I mean, there was definitely-- I mean, it's actually surprisingly hard to quantify. But, you know, it almost, for sure, if you want to think about who bought a Tesla, it would be somebody living in the wealthy suburbs of New York or San Francisco or LA, who was highly educated, high income, but also socially liberal. It's an electric vehicle. You're helping the environment. You're part of the future.And that's now saying, well, I'm helping make money for Elon Musk, is not going to appeal to that sort of person. There are wealthy people who buy luxury cars who don't have those concerns, but they probably weren't buying Teslas. And they probably aren't going to start buying Teslas now because electric vehicles and saving the planet isn't their thing.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And especially now perhaps, when people look at a Tesla, they don't necessarily think that anymore. It is very hard to separate the man from the brand, especially as he has become more vocal. I do want to ask about your comments. You've said that we're living in an era of petulant oligarchs. You've called Musk an insecure billionaire. Does it really matter at the end of the day for his brand?PAUL KRUGMAN: Well, it's-- you know, at the end of the day, meaning 15 years from now, it probably doesn't matter. Because it-- or put it this way, even if Musk had been everything that his fans imagined him to be, 15 years from now, Tesla was unlikely to dominate. But it's got to hurt now. I mean, these are-- it's kind of weird. We live in this high-tech age of all this stuff, but the probably personality celebrity image has never mattered more for business.You know, I don't think that anybody-- anybody who was buying a Chevrolet during the hegemony of General Motors thought much about what kind of a person Alfred Sloan was, and even Henry Ford was a character too. But still, the point is that we live in now-- maybe it's because we're a rich country and we're talking about semi-luxury goods. So the image of the figurehead for the company matters quite a lot. And, boy, Musk is not doing his business any favors.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, and certainly, when you look at some of the tweets, some of his reactions to criticism, sometimes it's great to get that direct reaction from a CEO, because sometimes if a story comes out, he's quick to correct it or add some nuance to it. But then some of the responses have ranged from sort of immature to spiteful as well. When you think of that picture that he paints for a brand like Tesla or some of his other companies, SpaceX, Twitter, and then you have this Twitter distraction, this idea of a distracted CEO, when, for some people, he can just do no wrong, he's a genius, how should we be-- what lens should we be viewing Elon Musk through?PAUL KRUGMAN: Well, I mean, it's got to be a bad thing. I mean, to a certain extent, for him to be highly visible was a good thing for the business. And look, there are two kinds of people who send me hysterical hate mail. And usually, it's not strictly political. There's crypto types, and there's Tesla fans, Elon Musk fans. And certainly, having that fan base was, in some ways, a good thing. But it clearly can be turned into a liability.And I have to say, I don't really understand it. I mean, I think if I had that much money, I really wouldn't much care what other people thought of me. I wouldn't be responding to random-- well, personally, if I responded to every random nasty thing somebody said on Twitter, I would have negative 30 hours in the day. And it's really amazing. But in any case, it's not a good sign. All the signals are exactly what you don't want to see in somebody who should be, like you said, laser-focused on building this business.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And so then when you look at some of this really core of diehard fans that support Musk, that doesn't necessarily mean that they're the ones buying his product. So if you could give him a message as to who he should really be listening to at this point? Because it does seem that he is revealing more of himself with every single tweet and every single reaction,PAUL KRUGMAN: Yeah, well, the trouble is, I'm not sure that there's useful advice to give. It would be one thing if he were acting out of character, and you could say, go back to the guy you were. This is probably who he always was. And what's happened is that he got himself wealth, and then the purchase of Twitter empowered him to sort of reveal more of his true self. And it's very hard to go back on that.I mean, I suppose it would-- if he were to actually go quiet about QAnon-ish stuff for a year, people might forget about it. But this is-- it is amazing. I mean, I've never-- and he isn't the first super rich head of a highly innovative company to kind of go off the deep end. The-- Henry Ford promoted the protocols of the Elders of Zion. He was a crazy conspiracy-minded anti-Semite. But they were different times, and it probably didn't matter as much. And now it does matter.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, that was Nobel laureate ""New York Times"" columnist and distinguished professor of economics at City University of New York Paul Krugman there. Obviously, some very interesting comments from Krugman there, Brad. He did raise a good point about the sort of cult of personality, because how many of us think, when we buy a jacket or something, about how the CEO's tweets or their feelings about things affect our ability to buy it? But Musk is a very sort of-- he's a very different CEO, and people have a very visceral reaction to him.BRAD SMITH: And here's the thing, for a lot of time, especially given what he's brought into the broader fold in the industry in automotive landscape, is this idea of how an electric vehicle can be sexy. I mean, just look at all of the different names that he tosses on his vehicle. It's the S. It's the 3. And you turn the three backwards, well, you got an E. He's got the X and the Y.And so all of that, he's tried to make it more sexy to have an electric vehicle. He started at the very kind of luxurious end of the market there. And then for how different he's been as a CEO, I think investors very much gravitated towards the stock in some cases because they saw the value attribution to having Elon Musk as a CEO. You had a CEO and a chief marketing officer all packaged up into one.And so with how he had been valued for many years and how he continues to be a major factor within Tesla, that is going to be a lingering question mark when you do have some of the succession planning that is necessary to take place for a company as large as Tesla as well. And so that perhaps something that investors will be paying close attention to in the future. But as of right now, no clear indication of who that next person would be.]"

But when then-Senator Richard Burr sold a bunch of stocks at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it caught the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Court filings suggest that the former North Carolina Senator sold $1.65 million worth of stocks on February 13, 2020, right before the pandemic-induced market tumble. The SEC was investigating whether Burr sold stocks “on the basis of material nonpublic information.”Luckily for Burr, the SEC ended its probe this month without taking action.“This week, the SEC informed me that they have concluded their investigation with no action,” Burr said in a statement. “I am glad to have this matter in the rearview mirror as I begin my retirement from the Senate following nearly three decades of public service.”Whether politicians should be allowed to trade stocks has always been a contentious subject. Some believe there’s a conflict of interest, while others argue that everyone has the right to invest their money as they see fit.Whichever side you’re on, it’s hard to deny that politicians can make some shrewd moves in the stock market.

The company raised its top-line expectations but lowered its operating margin and adjusted earnings guidance.Ravi Kumar recently served as president at Infosys until October 2022, leading Infosys Global Services Organization across all global industry segments.Cognizant also appointed Surya Gummadi as the president of Cognizant Americas, for which it had initially selected Ravi Kumar.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and Consensus Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and ConsensusCognizant Technology Solutions Corporation price-consensus-chart | Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation QuoteMoreover, Cognizant announced that Stephen J. Rohleder, a member of Cognizant’s board since March 2022, has been elected chair of the board.Cognizant Riding on Acquisitions &amp; PartnershipsCognizant shares have dropped 25.3% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s fall of 29% over the same time frame.Revenue-accretive acquisitions like OneSource Virtual, Utegration, and AustinCSI, as well as an expanding partner base that includes the likes of Microsoft MSFT, have been the key catalysts.OneSource Virtual is a leading provider of Workday WDAY services, solutions and products, while Utegration LLC is a full-service consulting and solutions provider, specializing in SAP’s SAP technology and SAP-certified products for the energy and utilities sectors.AustinCSI strengthens Cognizant’s footprint across the telecommunications, media, technology and automotive sectors. Utegration will help Cognizant to further benefit from the digital transformation megatrend, and increase market share in the energy and utilities sectors. The deal will help in implementing its SAP fintech solutions for its new clients.OneSource Vital’s offerings complement Cognizant’s existing finance and HR advisory implementation services with Workday. The transaction will expand Cognizant’s capabilities in consulting, deployment and post-deployment support across North America and the U.K. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.Acquisitions have been an integral part of Cognizant’s growth story in recent years. The company spent $715 million in 2021 on acquisitions. In the third quarter of 2022 (quarter ended Sep 30), acquisitions contributed 40 basis points (bps) to year-over-year revenue growth.Moreover, Cognizant’s expanding partnership with Microsoft is a key catalyst. The companies recently showcased a new solution — the Cognizant Sustainability Accelerator, powered by the Microsoft Cloud and Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability — at COP27. The solution combines Cognizant's deep experience in IoT and data analytics with Microsoft's cloud capabilities.Cognizant reported third-quarter 2022 revenues of $4.86 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.94%. The reported figure was within management’s revenue guidance of $4.90-$4.94 billion.Cognizant expects fourth-quarter 2022 revenues to be $4.8 billion (up from $4.72-$4.77 billion), indicating growth of 4.1% on a cc basis. Revenues for 2022 are expected to be $19.4 billion, indicating an improvement of 7.5% on a cc basis.The company expects the adjusted operating margin to contract by 30 bps (compared with the previous guidance) to 15.3% for 2022. This is primarily due to the impairment of certain capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with a Health Sciences customer.Adjusted earnings for 2022 are expected between $4.38 and $4.40 per share compared with the prior mentioned $4.43-$4.46.Cognizant, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is set to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 2.

64,a20076f8-a73a-390b-a8bc-08c88db27e1e,SIG,2023-01-14,4 Stocks With Robust Sales Growth for Assured Returns in 2023,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-robust-sales-growth-125112463.html,1673614272,STORY,"['SIG', 'CAG', 'CMS', 'COHR', 'CMS-PC']","[As the year 2022 ended on a grim note, it’s time for investors to re-assess their portfolio and investment strategy for 2023. While the recent economic data point to some effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors cautious, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. Therefore, a conventional stock-picking strategy is the need of the hour. One such way is selecting stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, stocks like Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG, Signet Jewelers Limited SIG, CMS Energy Corporation CMS and Coherent Corp. COHR are worth considering.While evaluating any company, revenues are often more scrutinized than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base. Steady or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate profit in the near term but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without robust revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continued bottom-line expansion usually requires strong sales growth.Yet, sales growth alone doesn’t show much about a company’s prospects. Hence, taking into account a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a practical investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.Selecting the Potential Winning StocksTo shortlist stocks with impressive sales growth and a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow of more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. Hence, we have added other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.P/S Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means that the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are four of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Chicago-based Conagra Brands is one of the leading branded food companies in North America. CAG offers premium edible products with a refined focus on innovation.Conagra Brands’ expected sales growth rate for fiscal 2023 is 6.8%. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present.Signet Jewelers, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, is a retailer of diamond jewelry, watches and other products. SIG is often considered the leading retailer of diamond jewelry.Signet Jewelers’ expected sales growth rate for fiscal 2024 is 1.4%. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.Jackson, MI-based CMS Energy is the holding company of Consumers Energy Company and CMS Enterprises Company. CMS operates largely in three business segments: Consumers electric utility, Consumers gas utility and Enterprises.CMS Energy’s sales are expected to rise 4.6% in 2023. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.Coherent, based in Saxonburg, PA, develops, manufactures and markets engineered materials, optoelectronic components and devices.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Cap Gemini SA and Paychex are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.CGEMY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.29, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 28.16. We also note that CGEMY has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.75.Another notable valuation metric for CGEMY is its P/B ratio of 3.16. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 13.48.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CGEMY's Value grade of A and PAYX's Value grade of C.Story continuesBoth CGEMY and PAYX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that CGEMY is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That’s what CEOs are increasingly telling remote workers who have grown accustomed to working from home—and who have ignored requests to resume working at the company building.On Wednesday, Starbucks announced that starting on Jan. 30, employees who live within commuting distance of its offices must return to working in them three days a week.Interim CEO Howard Schultz expressed annoyance that employees had ignored an earlier request to return to the office. While an agreement had been reached last year to work one to two days per week in the office, badge swipes indicated many employees “are not meeting their minimum promise,” he wrote in a blog post.Workers at Walt Disney Co. received a similar message this week from Bob Iger, who returned as CEO in November. In a memo sent Monday, according to Bloomberg, Iger wrote: “Employees currently working in a hybrid fashion will be asked to spend four days a week on-site, targeting Monday through Thursday as in-person workdays.”And at News Corp, parent company of Dow Jones, CEO Robert Thomson sent a memo on Thursday indicating that a return to the office will be mandatory, according to Talking Biz News.“I am asking the heads of our businesses to consult with their managers, and ultimately all of you, to ensure full compliance with in-office work schedules, so that what exists in theory happens in practice,” he wrote. “Those schedules will evolve in coming weeks, but the net result must be that more people return more frequently to our offices. Attendance is an absolute imperative as collaboration and cooperation are priorities for each of our businesses.”The remote-work normal that began with the pandemic has stretched on for years for many white-collar workers, many of whom have fought hard to keep working from home. But the latest missives from high-profile CEOs could point to a major new development in the return-to-office wars.Investment giant Vanguard Group, which requires employees to work from the office Tuesday through Thursday, sent a memo similar to Iger’s last month, noting that many employees had ignored a requirement to work in offices from Tuesday to Thursday, according to the Wall Street Journal.Story continuesSuch memos often argue that the company culture has suffered as a result of workers not collaborating in offices.At Starbucks, Schultz wrote, “I think many of us crave a bigger meaning to our work, and the camaraderie and joy from doing our best work together…Our culture depends on rituals—from coffee tastings to storytelling to seeing how our design experiences look end to end by putting the work up on a wall, and on and on.”At Disney, Iger reasoned, “In a creative business like ours, nothing can replace the ability to connect, observe, and create with peers that comes from being physically together, nor the opportunity to grow professionally by learning from leaders and mentors.”Vanguard, for its part, argued that the “inconsistent adoption” of the return-to-office mandate had “made it difficult to realize the benefits of in-person learning, collaboration and connection,” according to the Journal.At News Corp, Thomson wrote, “There is simply no way that true collective creativity can be consistently generated in not-so-splendid isolation. Screens deny us the subtleties of body language and the nuances of knowing glances. The spontaneity and serendipity of a dynamic office environment are crucial in creating and in iterating, so in-office attendance is vital to our future success.”Although he could be considered a bit of an outlier with his “extremely hardcore” work mandates, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, after taking over Twitter in late October for $44 billion, wrote in his first email to employees that remote work would be banned unless he personally approved it.In doing so, he became something of a figurehead for CEOs who’d grown weary of workers emphasizing work-life balance and disengaging from hustle culture.“I think every successful CEO, including myself, is tired of all the whining,” Michael Friedman, CEO at New York investment firm First Level Capital, told the Wall Street Journal in November.Schultz wrote in his memo that he wanted Starbucks headquarters and regional offices to become “vibrant hubs of great people doing great work, in person with each other.”He warned, “We are losing the art of collaboration…and we are having a hard time operationalizing decisions quickly and thoughtfully.”Fortune reached out to Disney and Starbucks for comment but received no immediate responses.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

The company is expected to deliver sales and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, indicating a 5.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For fiscal second-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $20.57 billion, suggesting a 1.8% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.We expect the company’s fiscal second-quarter total revenues to decline 4.6% year over year to $20,065.3 million and the bottom line to dip 5.4% to $1.57 per share.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 1.3%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 1.05%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price and EPS Surprise Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price and EPS SurpriseProcter &amp; Gamble Company The price-eps-surprise | Procter &amp; Gamble Company The QuoteKey Factors to NoteProcter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing higher freight, and commodity and input material cost inflation, which have been affecting its performance. The company’s gross margin for the fiscal second quarter is likely to have been under pressure, driven by the continued impacts of commodity and input material cost inflation, higher freight costs, negative product mix and other impacts, and increased product and packaging investments. Currency movements are expected to have negatively impacted all-in sales growth and earnings per share in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, Procter &amp; Gamble predicted higher commodity and freight costs to persist throughout fiscal 2023. Our estimate indicates a 4.7% year-over-year decline in gross profit for the fiscal second quarter, with the gross margin contracting 30 bps. We estimate a 6.1% decline in operating income in the fiscal second quarter, with the operating margin contracting 50 bps. This is likely to translate into a bottom-line decline in the to-be-reported quarter.Currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have weighed on the fiscal second-quarter performance. Our estimate indicates a 6% impact from currency headwinds in the fiscal second quarter.However, Procter &amp; Gamble has been gaining from improved productivity and persistent demand for cleaning products. The company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the benefits of continued strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which have been aiding organic sales growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for organic sales growth is pegged at 4.9%.The company has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans, which have been aiding its margins. PG has been witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of its business, driven by the productivity program. Its continued business investments and efforts to offset macro cost headwinds, and balanced top and bottom-line growth underscore its productivity efforts. Gains from productivity savings and pricing are expected to have aided margins and the bottom line in the fiscal second quarter.Moreover, the company is likely to have witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Procter &amp; Gamble this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, this is not the case here.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 26, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.62 a share.Archer Daniels Midland's Earnings ESP sits at 3.28%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.62 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57.ADM is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Corteva, Inc. (CTVA).Corteva, Inc. is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 1, 2023. CTVA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.08 a share 19 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Corteva, Inc. is $0.06, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 33.33%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ADM and CTVA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Closing bell on Wall Street. Let's check out how we finished out this week. It's been largely a pretty solid week. We talked about the CPI data earlier in the week, bank earnings today, and then possibly really turned on the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment number inflation. Expectations pretty solid, best since April 2021 in terms of the one-year outlook by the consumer. And there's your finish. The DOW gaining 0.3%, 112 points. The S&amp;P is up 0.4% and the NASDAQ also rising 78 points on the day. Seana.- All right. Let's take a look at Delta, because earnings were out soaring above expectations in the fourth quarter. But the airline continuing to see headwinds after trimming its guidance. Also citing profitability concerns. Here to discuss we want to bring in Savi Syth, Raymond James managing director. And Savi, when you take a look at the reaction here, some bit of concern from the street about what we saw from Delta. Fourth quarter numbers, though, look pretty solid to me. What do you think?SAVI SYTH: I think the fourth quarter number is solid, and it definitely beat expectations. I think it was the first quarter. And if you look at it, the revenue in the top line commentary is really strong. So I think there's a little bit more of an optics issue here, where some in consens-- in the consensus figures had costs that had the pilot deal.Some headed partially for the quarter, and some headed for the full quarter. So I think the reaction here has a little bit more to do with optics than reality. Also, if you take look at their 2023 cost guide, it hasn't changed. But the quarterly progression was a little bit different than we were thinking. And so I think it's more optics than-- than a really kind of disappointing update here.Story continues- Really just a lot to do with that new pilot contract that has not been ratified by the union yet. Ed Bastian saying he's never seen a more constructive backdrop for the industry. What do you make of that statement by the CEO?SAVI SYTH: I think if you look at third quarter 2022 and/or the second half of 2022, the airlines have fully recovered the-- the fuel price increase, which has doubled versus 2019, even though you have several components of demand that haven't recovered. You don't have a lot of large corporates still coming back. Some of the long haul international demand still coming back.So these demand, the avenue is still recovering and showing good progression on recovery, I think, they feel like the setup is pretty good. Obviously, you know, what everybody is worrying about is, you know, what the macroeconomic front will bring with some of the layoffs that you're seeing and what the Fed is trying to do, which is slow things down. But as it stands today, I think everything is looking quite strong from an airline demand perspective.- Savi, so that's Delta's story. I know you also cover American Airlines. And we saw the stock pop earlier this week hiking their revenue and their profit outlook. The position that American is in, comparing that to what we've seen from Delta, how do they stack up?SAVI SYTH: I think all these airlines are seeing a pretty similar environment. What I would say from a [INAUDIBLE] American, Delta, United, they are all benefiting from the fact that you still have long haul international that is recovering. You just started to see Japan open up. And a lot of the Pacific markets are finally in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter are recovering nicely.And you heard Delta today talk about in South America that's deep South America that's starting to finally recover and show good momentum. So this is really good for these [INAUDIBLE] that have international exposure. So I think the American revenue beat in the fourth quarter was stronger. But generally, I think they're all seeing a very positive environment here from a demand perspective. Admittedly, with one to three months of visibility versus what investors are worried about.- Yeah. All of them facing a couple of headwinds, including deliveries, and supply chains, and pilot shortages. Do you expect those to clear in the year ahead?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. For the [INAUDIBLE] I think the big thing is a training bottleneck as it comes to pilots. You're trying to train-- you're hiring four times as many pilots as you hired in the past. And the training footprints have been slow to expand. And it sounds like we should, as we head into the summer, be fully caught up, at least at the large airlines here. So that should start to ease.You're right about the supply chain. I think that's going to take longer. If you listen to the various OEMs, it sounds like something that's going to continue into 2024. Paradoxically, I think that might be good for the industry, because it will hold back capacity, especially in an environment where you might see some demand softening.- Savi, let's talk about Southwest, because I know you cover the stock. Certainly has been a rough couple of weeks for the company as they're trying to win back the trust in, really, consumers who were delayed and maybe never got on those flights during the holiday week. Talk to us just about the brand image that you think-- that you think Southwest is facing right now and whether or not you've changed your outlook on the stock as a result.SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I mean, it-- it's not good. And brand is something all these airlines protect jealously. And so they've definitely taken a hit here. What we've seen historically, though, is that consumers tend to have short memories. I think it will be important that Southwest doesn't repeat this again this summer. But as long as they kind of get their act together and-- and make sure they address this going forward, I think we'll see that for the most part collectively we'll have shorter memories. And the brand will over the longer term not-- not be as impacted. But they do have to take steps to make sure that this doesn't happen again.- Yeah. Estimate an $825 million hit, half of that due to lost revenue in those 16,000 canceled flights. Given what we saw from American and Delta, expectations for United who will report next week?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I mean, I-- I think you're going to see similar commentary about strong revenue environment. Again, they have greater exposure to international, and-- and that's the area that's recovering. So we-- we expect a kind of pretty good setup here. You know, they-- Similar to American, they hadn't updated their fourth quarter guidance.And so there could be kind of a-- a potentially stronger environment there. You saw both Southwest and American having some re-bookings from maybe Southwest customers that help offset the damage from the storms of their-- their own kind of revenue loss from the storms. So you might get that similar offset. So it looks like a pretty decent setup. Again, the question for United American is when are they going to get their pilot deals? And when-- when is that going to get reflected [INAUDIBLE]- No question about that. Every pilot is empowered right now to renegotiate with their union. They hold all the cards. So those salaries, certainly going up. Savi Syth, Raymond James, good to see you. Thanks so much. Enjoy the weekend.]"

We've been continuing to keep a close eye on the US major averages as we're lower across the board here. That, combined with some economic data, that's just come out at 10:00 AM. They're taking a look at the US major averages down right now fractionally for the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ. But to the breaking news, Julie.- Yeah, the economic news actually good. 64.6 the reading on University of Michigan's consumer confidence. This is the first reading we get for January, the preliminary reading for January, and it is better than estimated and an increase over the prior month. Current conditions at 68.6, much better than estimated. But even expectations are better than estimated at 62.So really interesting here. The projection for inflation a year from now is also coming down a little bit to 4% from 4.4% in the prior read. So, again, interesting here. A more positive read from consumer inflation, and is in line with-- some of the strategists and economists we've talked to said the consumer is actually OK for the moment. It's a question of what happens next.- Yeah, certainly. With regard to this reading, the current reading is the lowest since April of 2021, but the survey of consumers director, Joanne Chu, also points out that this remains well above the 2.3% to 3% range that they've seen within the two years prior to the pandemic.So that's some of the context on this, but the long run inflation expectations, they were little changed from December. And so, all of this considered, uncertainty both over inflation expectations and those measures remains high. They're pointing out as well changes in global factors in the months ahead may generate a reversal in some of those recent improvements they're noting here too.Story continues- Yeah, well nut that stuck to me here, guys, quickly is just the current assessments of personal finances up 16%. Really, the highest rating in eight months. Very interesting considering. And I know the survey pointed to easing inflation, but we were talking all week long about egg price inflation, rent price inflation, health care price inflation. So to see that increase was very interesting, especially stacked alongside what looks to be a disappointing holiday shopping season for a lot of retailers.- Yeah, but at the same time a lot of measures of inflation have eased, a lot of components of inflation have eased. Even as egg prices have gone up, some of the other protein prices have mitigated. And as we know, headline inflation was down a 1/10th of a percent month over month. So if people are watching like grocery prices, maybe that's, besides eggs, looks a little bit better.- Or maybe they're just not eating eggs. Maybe they're skipping eggs.- It also says in here it's also on the basis of higher income. So that is a factor as well, Sozz. So we're going to continue to watch these numbers. We also continue to watch what's going on with bank earnings this morning. ""Yahoo Finance's,"" Alexandra Semenova, has been tracking all of the numbers here. What has stood out to you thus far?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, guys, is just passing through some of these results, listening to some of these earnings call, the general takeaway is that it was a really lackluster quarter for Wall Street's big banks, as we can see from the market reaction today. Of course, the big themes are that investment banking revenue was down substantially, net interest income was up, and net loss reserves were up. Of course, these big banks were setting aside more rainy day funds for potentially sour loans.Let's start with JPMorgan. It is, of course, the largest consumer bank in the US by assets. So it's always a bellwether for how the economy is doing. And, of course, CEO, Jamie Dimon, is the most animated of bank CEOs. That was a really interesting call. The things that stood out to me was that $2.3 billion that they set aside for loan loss provisions. That amount was actually much higher than some of its peers, higher than Citibank and Bank of America.They attributed it to more credit card usage, people racking up those credit card debt due to inflation. They also attributed to the fact that they now forecast a mild recession. So they put a lot of reserves aside for that. Still though, CEO, Jamie Dimon, continued to say that the consumer is in good shape for now.Of course, people are eating away through those savings that they have allotted during the post-pandemic period. He did, however, point out a number of risks. The usual ones, as he highlighted in recent months, are continued worries about geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe. The war in Ukraine, of course, quantitative tightening what the Fed will do. So he warned about that. That's why the stock is down today.- Yeah, some of those warnings factoring into their modeling for a mild recession right now. What about Bank of America, Citi, Wells Fargo? What good nuggets were in there?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah. So Citigroup's profit actually fell because of those higher loan loss provisions and because of the slowdown in deal-making. However, it did have its best ever quarter for trading revenue. Citi CEO, Jane Fraser, actually said, ""That markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory."" Wells Fargo said that, ""It took a big hit on a $3.7 billion settlement with the CFPB to settle allegations that it harmed 16 million people with deposit accounts, auto loans, and mortgages.""And then Bank of America posted a modest increase in profits. It really reaped the benefits of higher interest rates. The bank reported a boost in net interest income, as well as higher trading revenue, specifically on fixed income. Bank of America has actually been expanding its fixed income business. And an interesting thing said on the call is the CFO said that they have no plans for any massive job cuts.That's, of course, different from what we're hearing from peers like Goldman Sachs, which is laying off more than 3,000 workers this week. And speaking of those job cuts, JPMorgan and Bank of America actually reported higher headcount. So really interesting to see that when we're hearing all this talk of Wall Street layoffs. They're actually still in hiring mode.- A busy morning for you. Alexandra Semenova, thanks so much. Appreciate it.]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +68.3%.Revenues are expected to be $7.83 billion, up 25.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger?For Schlumberger, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.46%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Schlumberger will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of $0.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering a surprise of +14.55%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.21, delivering a surprise of 10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, posted revenues of $3.92 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.02 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation shares have added about 5.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.7%.What's Next for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation?While The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

95,590974ed-7b1a-3d5a-b21c-5b25047fcb61,HOLX,2023-01-14,Why Hologic (HOLX) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-hologic-holx-could-beat-171005503.html,1673629805,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Hologic (HOLX), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This medical device maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 34.97%.For the most recent quarter, Hologic was expected to post earnings of $0.62 per share, but it reported $0.82 per share instead, representing a surprise of 32.26%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.69 per share, while it actually produced $0.95 per share, a surprise of 37.68%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Hologic, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Hologic currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.13%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 1, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

96,66242ddd-9a43-3830-bf6f-db058ecff379,HOLX,2023-01-14,What Makes Hologic (HOLX) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-hologic-holx-strong-momentum-170005905.html,1673629205,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Hologic (HOLX), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Hologic currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for HOLX that show why this medical device maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor HOLX, shares are up 4.04% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is up 2.44% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.48% compares favorably with the industry's 2.74% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Hologic have increased 29.66% over the past quarter, and have gained 14.16% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 11.88% and -14.35%, respectively.Investors should also take note of HOLX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, HOLX is averaging 1,543,124 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with HOLX.Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HOLX's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.46 to $3.48 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that HOLX is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Hologic on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

103,27407075-391d-30a4-b428-bb6ba52d2059,AMGN,2023-01-14,Investing in Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) five years ago would have delivered you a 66% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-amgen-nasdaq-amgn-five-110110038.html,1673694070,STORY,['AMGN'],"[If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) share price is up 44% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. Also positive is the 15% share price rise over the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 2.8% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Amgen the TSR over the last 5 years was 66%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Amgen has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 19% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 11% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Amgen , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.We will like Amgen better if we see some big insider buys.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this gold and copper miner have returned +17.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, to which Newmont belongs, has gained 11.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.35 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -55.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.79 points to a change of -39.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.30 indicates a change of +28.6% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Newmont is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Newmont, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.92 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -13.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.73 billion and $12.05 billion estimates indicate -4% and +2.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $2.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.59%. The EPS surprise was -6.9%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.4%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.33%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.1%.Coming into today, shares of the department store operator had gained 8.33% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 3.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.01%.Macy's will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Macy's is projected to report earnings of $1.62 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 33.88%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.22 billion, down 5.08% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.18 per share and revenue of $24.44 billion, which would represent changes of -21.28% and -0.06%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Macy's. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Macy's is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Macy's currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.45.

As an industry we’ve already bought them, at a cost of billions of dollars, a gift that’s genuinely priceless and always in style: the smug self-satisfaction of knowing they were always right.After all that happened in 2022, it would be nice to know that we’re busy learning all the right and important lessons. Don’t count on it. Thanks to the miracle of confirmation bias, those advocating proof of reserves, auditing or just the end of the crypto will see the events of the year as confirmation that we need to do whatever it was they were already pitching. I’m no exception: ya’ll need more audits.Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 package.As for myself, I write this in a dark mood not because exchanges and hedge funds have collapsed, nor because bad people are going free, having fully apologized on Twitter, and I’m not frustrated by the possibility that caution by customers and regulators could slow the growth of this amazing technology. No indeed. What I’m frustrated with is the slow progress of public blockchains, privacy technology and industrial applications. There’s so much more to blockchain than crypto and we’re just not getting there fast enough.As we move forward I see three challenges that we should have progressed past but somehow haven’t managed to do. The first is the blockchain program of speed-running the history of financial regulation by making all the mistakes and skipping any useful lessons that former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke may have learned, and for which he won a Nobel Prize. Over and over again we have seen compelling evidence that poorly regulated or unregulated financial entities are at risk for bank runs and that financial services pose systemic risks to the rest of the economic ecosystem.Every time one of these events happens the response of crypto purists is to declare that only decentralized finance works and that must be the path ahead. This is folly. Creating an ultra-low-risk financial system that runs only on-chain will defeat the entire purpose of capital markets: to channel capital to risk-takers who can use it to build businesses. The moment you take risk you enter in the space of human judgment and away from strict algorithms.Story continuesRead more: Paul Brody - Why Blockchains Are as Important as ERP for the Future of CompaniesThe second disappointment is our slow progress around the world on well-organized blockchain and cryptocurrency regulations. Enforcement actions against bad actors make sense, but in the absence of positive rules they also have a chilling effect on good actors who would like to enter the business but are afraid of finding themselves on the wrong side of rules that have yet to be set. I’m not speculating here. I know. EY serves multiple blue chip financial institutions that are waiting for clarity before they enter the stablecoin and crypto space.So, we’re now in a less than ideal situation. Bad actors are undeterred by the lack of regulation, but good actors are. The result: Bad actors face far less competition. It’s not, thankfully, zero competition. There are quite a lot of good actors in this space, but due to absent regulatory clarity and standards even those players are having a hard time differentiating themselves from the bad guys. Every bad actor claims they’re audited, professionally run and take compliance seriously, and few end-users know enough to tell the truth from fiction.Blue chip financial institutions are waiting for clarity before they enter the stablecoin and crypto space.Lastly, a looming recession and an endless stream of crypto failures is trimming budgets and enthusiasm for risk-takers in the industrial space. It’s hard enough convincing risk-averse chief investment officers to bet on emerging technologies; it gets even harder as they contemplate slashing budgets in the face of a potential recession.Read more: Jeff Wilser and Xinyi Luo - 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023If there is a silver lining to the probability that we will learn no useful lessons from this difficult time, it is that progress for public blockchains, for Ethereum and for privacy technology is inevitable. Nothing that has happened this year has made private and permissioned blockchains any more useful or interesting. Along the way, lots of good things are happening as well. I want to pick out three from 2022:First, the Merge. The people of Ethereum put to rest any more ideas that they can’t run globally important infrastructure. The orderly shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake blew away, with one stroke, two of the biggest complaints enterprises had about Ethereum: that there is no clear accountability to responsibly manage the system and that it generates too large a carbon footprint. The battle for layer one is over and Ethereum won.Second, non-fungible tokens. The market for speculative generative art has largely deflated, but the market for enduring and transferable personal digital trophies, proof of attendance and collectibles is just getting started. NFTs will soon be everywhere for everything from concert tickets to race medals. It’s not about making money. It’s about collecting the story of your life and accomplishments and sharing them with the world. NFTs have immense industrial applications as well. Most things companies make are unique, even if that’s just the batch number or serial number. That’s still an NFT, not a fungible token.Finally, DAOs. Decentralized autonomous organizations are a ray of sunshine in the blockchain ecosystem. They are emerging as a vehicle for people to build and organize just about everything, from new companies to shared investment vehicles to non-profit charities. This year they started to accelerate, with a wide range of tools and services making it easy for just about anyone to set up and start managing a DAO.2022 is over, and that’s a relief. The building goes on and the bad actors of this year will soon just be quiz show trivia questions. Onwards.]"

The peso slid 0.5% against the greenback, as prices of the red metal, of which Chile is a top producer, took a breather following their sharp rally this week. Latin American currencies have gained 2.8% so far this week and were on track for their second week of gains, in an upbeat start to January and 2023. Peru's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.75% on Thursday, as the nation battles the highest inflation in a quarter of a century. ""Although inflation has already shown signs of slowing, it has been without conviction, and the central bank will seek to ensure that inflation returns to the target range,"" said Mario Guerrero, deputy head economist for Peru at Scotiabank. Thousands took to the streets of Peru's capital Lima in a peaceful protest against the new government and president, after weeks of bloody clashes triggered by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo left at least 42 dead. ""In the near-term, the protests could put further upward pressure on inflation,"" William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note. ""Peru has been one of the fastest growing economies in the region over the past few decades, but it's hard to see that continuing."" The sol has lagged peers so far this year, up just 0.3%, compared to other Latin American currencies gaining nearly 3% each. Peru's economy likely grew slightly less than 2.9% last year, a senior central bank official said, suggesting that the South American country's economy expanded less than previously forecast, due in part to an explosion of social unrest that began in December. Brazil's real was flat against the dollar. Data showed economic activity in Brazil fell more than expected in November, in the fourth straight month of contraction. Shares of Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras fell more than 1%. The government has officially nominated Jean Paul Prates to serve as its chief executive officer and board member, the company said. The Colombian peso dipped 0.1% on Friday, and has added 3.5% so far this week. Emerging market bonds are off to a roaring start to the new year. Developing countries have sold $39 billion worth of international bonds since the start of 2023, with investors happy to pile into riskier debt as they bet global interest rates are nearing a peak.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, NextEra Energy Partners is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Bloom Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that NEP has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.NEP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 25.40, while BE has a forward P/E of 405.09. We also note that NEP has a PEG ratio of 2.54. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. BE currently has a PEG ratio of 16.20.Another notable valuation metric for NEP is its P/B ratio of 0.52. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BE has a P/B of 22.76.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, NEP holds a Value grade of B, while BE has a Value grade of F.NEP is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

The bottom line reflects a rise of 25% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for earnings was $1.09.Results have been aided by a rise in net interest revenues. However, asset balances witnessed a decline, which was a negative. Higher expenses and lower fee revenues have hurt the results to some extent.Net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $509 million or 62 cents per share, down from $822 million or $1.01 per share recorded in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for net income was $852.2 million.For 2022, adjusted earnings of $4.59 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.41. The bottom line reflects a rise of 8.3% from the prior-year period. Our estimate for earnings was $4.31. Net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $2.36 billion or $2.90 per share, down from $3.55 billion or $4.14 per share recorded in the year-ago period.

The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.75 billion.Quarterly net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, were $1.06 billion, up 55.4% year over year. The rise reflected higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding expenses.The net interest margin (FTE basis) expanded 48 basis points (bps) year over year to 1.19%.Total fee and other revenues declined 14.3% to $2.86 billion. The decline was due to a fall in investment management and performance fees, foreign exchange revenues, financing-related fees, and investment and other revenues. Our estimate for the same was $3.19 billion.Total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) were $3.21 billion, up 8.3% year over year. The rise was due to an increase in almost all cost components, except for sub-custodian and clearing costs, bank assessment charges, costs related to the amortization of intangible assets, and other expenses. Our estimate for expenses was $3.02 billion.Story continuesAsset Balances DeclineAs of Dec 31, 2022, assets under management were $1.84 trillion, down 25% year over year. The decline was due to lower market values, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and the divestiture of Alcentra, partially offset by net inflows. Our estimate for AUM was $2.12 trillion.Assets under custody and/or administration of $44.3 trillion declined 5%, primarily reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by client inflows and net new business.Credit Quality: Mixed BagAllowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, was 0.27%, down 2 bps from the prior-year quarter.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The Bassett financing program will form a part of Synchrony’s HOME Network and subsequently, get an opportunity to tap more than five million clients forming a part of the network.Shares of Synchrony lost 0.5% on Jan 12, replicating declines in broader markets.The program formed as a result of the latest partnership extends seamless and affordable payment options to avail promotional financing by consumers in any of the 92 self-owned or license-owned stores of Bassett Furniture.Additionally, the financing program will be backed with enhanced technology solutions of Synchrony, such as prequalification, Direct to Device and dApply. Prequalification can be utilized for monitoring credit eligibility by customers without affecting one’s credit score.Direct to Device enables the usage of a customer’s own device to apply for credit while making in-store purchases. Meanwhile, the dApply solution is backed with prefill technology to accelerate the credit application process for shoppers. On a daily basis, Synchrony will also engage in advanced data analytics sharing on vital customer information such as financing, shopping, and servicing preferences with Bassett.Integration of Synchrony’s credible solutions within Bassett’s financing program will ease the financing application process and inject security within the procedure, thereby bringing a hassle-free experience for customers. This, in turn, will boost the purchasing power of consumers.The recent tie-up reflects Synchrony’s continuous efforts to meet evolving customer expectations and deliver affordable financing options across diversified industries. Thus, these steady efforts result in stronger customer relationships giving way for higher card acquisitions, bolstered credit lines, increased repeat sales and a greater customer lifetime value.Story continuesAn enhanced payment and financing solutions portfolio of Synchrony has made it a preferred choice among those inclined to grow their business prospects and extend a seamless customer experience. Financing programs similar to the Bassett one, which is an addition to SYF's program agreements, are likely to boost fees received by Synchrony from its partners as compensation for the interest income bygone as part of the promotional financing offers.Shares of Synchrony have gained 11.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 0.7% growth.

As an industry we’ve already bought them, at a cost of billions of dollars, a gift that’s genuinely priceless and always in style: the smug self-satisfaction of knowing they were always right.After all that happened in 2022, it would be nice to know that we’re busy learning all the right and important lessons. Don’t count on it. Thanks to the miracle of confirmation bias, those advocating proof of reserves, auditing or just the end of the crypto will see the events of the year as confirmation that we need to do whatever it was they were already pitching. I’m no exception: ya’ll need more audits.Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 package.As for myself, I write this in a dark mood not because exchanges and hedge funds have collapsed, nor because bad people are going free, having fully apologized on Twitter, and I’m not frustrated by the possibility that caution by customers and regulators could slow the growth of this amazing technology. No indeed. What I’m frustrated with is the slow progress of public blockchains, privacy technology and industrial applications. There’s so much more to blockchain than crypto and we’re just not getting there fast enough.As we move forward I see three challenges that we should have progressed past but somehow haven’t managed to do. The first is the blockchain program of speed-running the history of financial regulation by making all the mistakes and skipping any useful lessons that former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke may have learned, and for which he won a Nobel Prize. Over and over again we have seen compelling evidence that poorly regulated or unregulated financial entities are at risk for bank runs and that financial services pose systemic risks to the rest of the economic ecosystem.Every time one of these events happens the response of crypto purists is to declare that only decentralized finance works and that must be the path ahead. This is folly. Creating an ultra-low-risk financial system that runs only on-chain will defeat the entire purpose of capital markets: to channel capital to risk-takers who can use it to build businesses. The moment you take risk you enter in the space of human judgment and away from strict algorithms.Story continuesRead more: Paul Brody - Why Blockchains Are as Important as ERP for the Future of CompaniesThe second disappointment is our slow progress around the world on well-organized blockchain and cryptocurrency regulations. Enforcement actions against bad actors make sense, but in the absence of positive rules they also have a chilling effect on good actors who would like to enter the business but are afraid of finding themselves on the wrong side of rules that have yet to be set. I’m not speculating here. I know. EY serves multiple blue chip financial institutions that are waiting for clarity before they enter the stablecoin and crypto space.So, we’re now in a less than ideal situation. Bad actors are undeterred by the lack of regulation, but good actors are. The result: Bad actors face far less competition. It’s not, thankfully, zero competition. There are quite a lot of good actors in this space, but due to absent regulatory clarity and standards even those players are having a hard time differentiating themselves from the bad guys. Every bad actor claims they’re audited, professionally run and take compliance seriously, and few end-users know enough to tell the truth from fiction.Blue chip financial institutions are waiting for clarity before they enter the stablecoin and crypto space.Lastly, a looming recession and an endless stream of crypto failures is trimming budgets and enthusiasm for risk-takers in the industrial space. It’s hard enough convincing risk-averse chief investment officers to bet on emerging technologies; it gets even harder as they contemplate slashing budgets in the face of a potential recession.Read more: Jeff Wilser and Xinyi Luo - 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023If there is a silver lining to the probability that we will learn no useful lessons from this difficult time, it is that progress for public blockchains, for Ethereum and for privacy technology is inevitable. Nothing that has happened this year has made private and permissioned blockchains any more useful or interesting. Along the way, lots of good things are happening as well. I want to pick out three from 2022:First, the Merge. The people of Ethereum put to rest any more ideas that they can’t run globally important infrastructure. The orderly shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake blew away, with one stroke, two of the biggest complaints enterprises had about Ethereum: that there is no clear accountability to responsibly manage the system and that it generates too large a carbon footprint. The battle for layer one is over and Ethereum won.Second, non-fungible tokens. The market for speculative generative art has largely deflated, but the market for enduring and transferable personal digital trophies, proof of attendance and collectibles is just getting started. NFTs will soon be everywhere for everything from concert tickets to race medals. It’s not about making money. It’s about collecting the story of your life and accomplishments and sharing them with the world. NFTs have immense industrial applications as well. Most things companies make are unique, even if that’s just the batch number or serial number. That’s still an NFT, not a fungible token.Finally, DAOs. Decentralized autonomous organizations are a ray of sunshine in the blockchain ecosystem. They are emerging as a vehicle for people to build and organize just about everything, from new companies to shared investment vehicles to non-profit charities. This year they started to accelerate, with a wide range of tools and services making it easy for just about anyone to set up and start managing a DAO.2022 is over, and that’s a relief. The building goes on and the bad actors of this year will soon just be quiz show trivia questions. Onwards.]"

The peso slid 0.5% against the greenback, as prices of the red metal, of which Chile is a top producer, took a breather following their sharp rally this week. Latin American currencies have gained 2.8% so far this week and were on track for their second week of gains, in an upbeat start to January and 2023. Peru's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.75% on Thursday, as the nation battles the highest inflation in a quarter of a century. ""Although inflation has already shown signs of slowing, it has been without conviction, and the central bank will seek to ensure that inflation returns to the target range,"" said Mario Guerrero, deputy head economist for Peru at Scotiabank. Thousands took to the streets of Peru's capital Lima in a peaceful protest against the new government and president, after weeks of bloody clashes triggered by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo left at least 42 dead. ""In the near-term, the protests could put further upward pressure on inflation,"" William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note. ""Peru has been one of the fastest growing economies in the region over the past few decades, but it's hard to see that continuing."" The sol has lagged peers so far this year, up just 0.3%, compared to other Latin American currencies gaining nearly 3% each. Peru's economy likely grew slightly less than 2.9% last year, a senior central bank official said, suggesting that the South American country's economy expanded less than previously forecast, due in part to an explosion of social unrest that began in December. Brazil's real was flat against the dollar. Data showed economic activity in Brazil fell more than expected in November, in the fourth straight month of contraction. Shares of Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras fell more than 1%. The government has officially nominated Jean Paul Prates to serve as its chief executive officer and board member, the company said. The Colombian peso dipped 0.1% on Friday, and has added 3.5% so far this week. Emerging market bonds are off to a roaring start to the new year. Developing countries have sold $39 billion worth of international bonds since the start of 2023, with investors happy to pile into riskier debt as they bet global interest rates are nearing a peak.

Expedia (EXPE), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This online travel company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 14.48%.For the last reported quarter, Expedia came out with earnings of $4.05 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 per share, representing a surprise of 4.11%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.96 per share, delivering a surprise of 24.84%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Expedia lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Expedia currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.03%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Per the terms of the deal, Bell-Boeing will offer continued flight test support for the V-22 aircraft.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. Work related to this deal will be executed in Patuxent River, MD.Growing Jet Demand &amp; V-22 JetsA rapid increase in terror attacks has compelled nations to strengthen their arsenal and bump up their defense budget. With the United States being the largest exporter of defense equipment across the world, there is a steady flow of contracts for its combat-proven weaponry from both Pentagon and its foreign allies. With military jets and helicopters constituting a major portion of a nation’s armaments, there is a steady flow of contracts for these.Bell-Boeing’s primary product, V-22 Osprey is a family of multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. Notably, the CV-22 is a variant of the V-22 family of jets and helps conduct long-range infiltration, exfiltration and resupply missions for special operations forces.Considering these features of the aforementioned family of tiltrotors and the growing demand for military aircraft, V-22 and its variants enjoy decent demand across the globe. The latest deal win is a bright example of that.Jet Manufacturers’ ProspectsPer a forecast made by Mordor Intelligence, the global military aviation market size is projected to register a CAGR of 5.4% during the 2022-2028 period. This surely is going to benefit major U.S. combat aircraft manufacturers like Bell-Boeing, Lockheed LMT and Northrop Grumman NOC, with North America dominating this market space.Lockheed Martin is one of the pioneers in the combat aircraft space, with its product portfolio constituting some of the most advanced military aircraft like F-35, C-130, F-16, F-22 and a few more. Of these, F-35 is the company’s largest program.Story continuesLockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. In the past year, the stock has gained 23.9%.On the other hand, Northrop is a renowned manufacturer of autonomous and manned aircraft like MQ-4C Triton and Global Hawk. These jets are used for battle management, strike and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.Northrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%. In the past year, the stock has gained 20.9%.Price Movement &amp; Zacks RankTextron’s stock has gained 21% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 9.8%.

Anjalee Khemlani back with us, second time in studio.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: I know.DAVE BRIGGS: Lucky for us on a Friday. What can you tell us?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, I can tell you that this slash in production is happening again. This is the second time that we've heard of Johnson &amp; Johnson slashing its production. But specifically this time around, according to reports, the company has cut back on its contracts with the manufacturers it was working with, including Catalent and Sanofi. We did hear earlier on last year from CFO Joe Wolk. Here's what he had to say then.JOE WOLK: Right now, we are, like we would do for any product, rightsizing our manufacturing footprint, our R&amp;D programs, to correlate better with the demand that's out there. And so we are tapering back. But we're still in the business. We're going to meet our regulatory as well as our commercial commitments, and just rightsizing it for, really, the business prospects that are out there.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That commercial commitment is really a key point there because that has been the focus of a few cases that have happened-- or, not really cases, but let's talk about it in terms of arbitration, specifically with Merck, one of the manufacturers that came in to help save Johnson &amp; Johnson at a time that it had manufacturing struggles early on in the pandemic.We don't want to go over the whole history, but it's safe to say that Johnson &amp; Johnson has really struggled with this COVID vaccine during the pandemic, first with issues with reports of blood clots, as well as the manufacturing concern. So this just looks more and more like the company could be close to, you know, maybe stopping. I don't know. I would love to ask them that. And I believe I've had in the past on whether or not they would actually stop producing the COVID vaccine, considering globally there's no demand for it now.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, you don't hear a whisper about it, do you? Anj, thanks so much. Great information. Enjoy the weekend.]"

At least nine companies agreed to help manufacture J&amp;J's shot. Wall Street Journal noted.Yet J&amp;J's vaccine hasn't been as widely used as the Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) or Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) shots.Manufacturing issues limited the shot's availability, and the risk of a severe but rare blood-clotting condition discouraged some people from using it.Roughly 400 million doses of the original Pfizer-BioNTech shot and nearly 250 million doses of the original Moderna shot have been administered in the U.S., compared with about 19 million J&amp;J doses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The pharma giant has terminated manufacturing agreements with companies that helped produce the shot during the pandemic, such as Catalent Inc (NYSE: CTLT) and Sanofi SA (NASDAQ: SNY).Also, a partnership with Merck &amp; Co Inc (NYSE: MRK) to help make the shots, forged at the U.S. government's urging, has fallen short of expectations. The companies are now engaged in arbitration.Catalent agreed to early termination of contracts with J&amp;J for fill-and-finish of vaccine vials. Catalent said it received payments of $54 million from J&amp;J to resolve the contracts in October.In June, J&amp;J planned to terminate its Covid-19 vaccine supply with Emergent BioSolutions Inc (NYSE: EBS), and both companies accused each other of breaching the agreement.In the most recent quarter, JNJ generated $489 million in COVID-19 vaccine sales during the quarter, with none from the U.S.In the Q1 earnings release, JNJ suspended its sales forecast for the COVID-19 vaccine due to global supply surplus and demand uncertainty.Price Action: JNJ shares are down 0.43% at $173.26 on the last check Friday.Photo via Wikimedia CommonsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Airbus said in a statement to Reuters it appreciated the FAA's recognition of Tidball's impartiality concerning safety but given ""the panel’s focus on a particular (Original Equipment Manufacturer, Tidball)... has decided to recuse himself from this working group.""The panel, which Congress required under a 2020 lawto reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes, has ninemonths to complete its review and issue findings andrecommendations. Congress directed the agency toappoint a panel by early 2021, but the FAA missed that deadline.A 2020 U.S. House report said the MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 ""were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing's engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing's management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.""Boeing last week declined to comment on the panel, but previously emphasized it has significantly reformed its safety culture after the MAX crashes cost it more than $20 billion.Last month, Congress voted to lift a Dec. 27 deadlineimposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for twonew versions of the 737 MAX aircraft that could have put thefuture of those new models at risk.In May, the FAA opted to renew Boeing's OrganizationDesignation Authorization (ODA) program for three years ratherthan the five years Boeing sought.The FAA continues to subject Boeing to enhanced oversight,inspecting all new Boeing 737 MAXs and 787s before they can be delivered.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

That comes after Elon Musk’s space conglomerate took in $250 million from investors in 2022 and $1.5 billion in 2021.“SpaceX is almost like a sovereign entity in their ability to raise capital endlessly,” says Chris Quilty, a space industry analyst.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureThe reason wouldn’t surprise Peter Thiel, the SpaceX investor and Musk collaborator, who has argued that the best business model is a monopoly. SpaceX dominates most sectors it plays in, but in a few—human spaceflight and launching large satellites—it’s the only game in town.Investors are handing Musk their money to fund ambitious projects like Starlink, the company’s satellite network, and Starship, its next rocket (more on that later). But one reason they can feel secure betting on those frontier technologies is how reliant the US government is on SpaceX.The US military’s secret satellitesThis weekend, the company will launch its Falcon Heavy rocket for the fifth time. The rocket, boasting three reusable boosters, is the second most powerful operating launch vehicle in the world after Boeing’s Space Launch System debuted last year, but it costs about ten times less. This weekend, SpaceX will use the rocket to launch classified spacecraft for the US Space Force.The most important satellites used by the US military to coordinate its forces around the globe live in high orbits some 27,000 miles above the Earth. It’s difficult to get there, by design—that keeps the satellites safe from attacks from the ground. And right now, only SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy can deliver those big satellites to geostationary orbits. The SLS is way too expensive, Boeing retired the Delta IV rocket that used to do that job, and the United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket still has yet to fly, though it is expected to do so later this year.Story continuesFor the foreseeable future, then, the US military is dependent on SpaceX for heavy lift. And SpaceX is taking advantage: While its first Falcon Heavy launch for the US military in 2019 cost just $130 million, this mission cost $316 million. Inflation and the complexity of the mission are part of the reason for the increase, but the other part is simply what a one-provider market can bear.There’s a similar situation when it comes to flying astronauts for NASA on the Dragon spacecraft. The space agency is waiting on Boeing to deliver its troubled Starliner vehicle to provide a second option for American space travelers. Until it does later this year, though, SpaceX is the only option. When the Russian Soyuz spacecraft currently at the International Space Station started to leak late last year, NASA turned to SpaceX in case it needed an extra spacecraft on station.Now, Russia is sending up an uncrewed replacement Soyuz, but if an emergency occurs before it arrives, NASA is counting on a Dragon currently docked at the ISS to carry five people safely back to Earth instead of the standard four.Competition is on the horizonSpaceX’s market position is akin to that of Tesla a few years ago. The only provider of electric cars on a mass scale, it was able to dominate its industry. In many ways, it still does. But other automakers are starting to catch up with their own electric vehicles. That, as much as Twitter controversies, is driving the recent plunge in Tesla’s stock price.SpaceX, meanwhile, is operating in an industry in which competing rockets are on the horizon. United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, plans to launch the Vulcan rocket for the first time later this year; it began its journey to Cape Canaveral from the factory in Alabama today. Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’ space company, has similar plans to debut its New Glenn vehicle in 2023. Those two rockets could offer stiff competition for the Falcon Heavy if they live up to their billing. In addition, companies like Rocket Lab and Relativity Space are developing new rockets that could compete with SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which launched a record 60 times in 2022.That’s why so much of SpaceX’s attention has been on its next rocket, the Starship, and its reusable booster.SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy booster on the launch pad in Boca Chica, Texas. SpaceX’s Starship and Super Heavy booster on the launch pad in Boca Chica, Texas.Starship would be even larger and more powerful than the Falcon Heavy or the SLS, and because it is built to be fully reusable, would be one of the most efficient rockets ever made. Musk said this week that he expected the first test flight of this vehicle to take place by early March, which is not an unreasonable assumption.Still, rocket development is slow, and any number of surprises could delay the Starship. If and when real competitors arrive for SpaceX’s existing launch vehicles, Musk could take a different page out of the Tesla playbook: Today, the carmaker said it is cutting prices as much as 20% across its line of vehicles. It won’t be good for the company’s profitability, but analysts think it could help protect the company’s market share.

That includes a reassessment of risk tolerance. Many people are moving to more conservative holdings, understandably shaken by the magnitude and velocity of declines in growth securities in 2022.This has created some unintended consequences to be aware of. Many safe haven companies in sectors such as consumer staples and utilities have run up significantly. The rush into safe dividend stocks has made valuations much less appealing in various sectors.However, there are still plenty of good values in the dividend stock-paying arena. Investors just need to be a little more picky to make sure they are picking up dividend stocks that are still selling at an attractive price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo be eligible for this list, a company needs to pay a decent starting dividend yield, 2.0% or more. And, it has to be undervalued. I’ll use Morningstar’s fair value price estimate as the benchmark there, with a dividend stock needing to trade at a meaningful discount to that Morningstar estimate to make this list. With the ground rules set, here are seven leading dividend-paying stocks trading at a discount today.TickerCompanyPriceVZVerizon Communications$41.70CSCOCisco Systems$48.88VFCV.F. Corp$29.81PKPark Hotels &amp; Resorts$11.88AVBAvalonBay Communities$162.85BKBank of New York Mellon$48.12EMNEastman Chemical$88.86Verizon Communications (VZ)Verizon (VZ) logo on the side of a gray building.Source: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is one of America’s three large telecom operators. It is the most appealing dividend stock of the three. That’s because AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) slashed its dividend not that long ago, while T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) pays no dividend at all. Verizon, by contrast, has continued offering its usual generous dividend without interruption.Verizon is an attractive dividend stock for several reasons. One, its industry is stable and recession resistant. People keeping paying their phone bills even in a recession after all.Story continuesThere are also massive barriers to entry. Verizon and its competitors spend tens of billions of dollars to maintain and modernize their telecom infrastructure. Lately, Verizon shares have underperformed due to this spending. 5G rollout hasn’t delivered the expected level of returns as quickly as anticipated.However, Verizon’s large investments over the past few years will eventually bear fruit. Meanwhile, shares trade for just 8x forward earnings and offer a 6.2% dividend yield. Morningstar currently assigns a $59 price target for VZ stock, which offers tremendous upside from today’s $42 share price.Cisco Systems (CSCO)A Cisco (CSCO) sign outside of a building.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the king of internet networking equipment. It was formerly a hot stock, with Cisco being one of the leading performers in the late 1990s internet boom.Nowadays, Cisco is more of a stable growth and income sort of company. It has evolved from a hypergrowth firm to a dividend stock. But don’t mistake that for a lack of investment appeal.Indeed, Cisco still generates more than $50 billion per year in revenues. And after a period of decline, Cisco is now growing revenues again. Its efforts to broaden its product offerings and earn more subscription revenues are starting to pay off.CSCO stock has traded down more than 20% over the past year. That’s not too surprising given the plunge in the tech sector more generally. However, with that decline, Cisco now goes for less than 14 times forward earnings and offers a 3.1% dividend yield.V.F. Corp (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comV.F. Corp (NYSE:VFC) is a leading multi-brand apparel company. Historically, the company’s strength is that it takes a conglomerate approach to the industry. It owns more than a dozen brands and is frequently buying and selling labels to maximize value for the firm.This provides the company with internal diversification. When one brand is struggling, another one is usually doing well. For example, in 2022, The North Face performed well while Vans was stuck in a sales slump.Investors have dumped VFC stock over the past 18 months or so, with shares now down 70% from their all-time highs. This seems like a dramatic overcorrection given VF Corp remains solidly profitable despite current supply chain and inflation headwinds.VF has proven it can deal with adversity. It has increased its dividend for an amazing 50 years in a row despite a variety of economic downturns along the way. VFC stock is now a high-yielding option at a 6.9% dividend today.Park Hotels &amp; Resorts (PK)a Park Hotels &amp; Resorts (PK) branded destinationSource: ShutterstockPark Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE:PK) is a real estate investment trust dedicated to the lodging sector. It operates 47 premium branded hotels and resorts that contain 30,000 rooms in total. Importantly, 88% of these rooms are in the luxury or upscale categories, which means Park can charge premium prices for its stays.Park is an intriguing asset as it has been in transition. It was spun out of a larger company in 2017. It subsequently made a large acquisition in 2019, and has sold off various assets since then to refocus its portfolio on premium domestic hotels.Park was supposed to begin to show the merit of this approach in 2020 and 2021. However, the pandemic hit, and demand for hotel rooms plummeted. Now, however, the travel industry has started to surge once again, with high-end travel faring particularly well. This should bode well for Park Hotels and Resorts.Morningstar’s analyst Kevin Brown assigns PK stock a price target of $28 per share. That’s tremendous upside from today’s $12 share price. Brown arrives that price target with a fairly conservative assumption of a 12 times forward funds from operations ratio for Park’s shares.AvalonBay Communities (AVB)AVB stock: an Avalon sign in a garden next to a roadSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.comAvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB) formed in 1998 with the merger of Avalon Properties and Bay Apartment Communities. In the ensuing 25 years, AvalonBay has become one of America’s largest landlords.Currently, the company directly or indirectly owns nearly 300 different apartment communities. These, in turn, contain 88,405 different apartments. This gives AvalonBay a considerable amount of scale in terms of maintaining properties, finding tenants and expanding into additional markets.Apartments are currently an attractive investment field. Rents have soared over the past few years as people have upgraded their living conditions. The surge in housing prices and rising interest rates, meanwhile, have made home ownership a more expensive prospect for many households. That causes folks to rent apartments from the likes of AvalonBay instead of buying their own single-family home.AvalonBay shares have fallen a shocking 35% over the past year. This is primarily due to fears around rising interest rates and a slowdown in the housing market. However, thanks to favorable demographics, demand for apartments should remain strong despite near-term jitters. AVB stock currently yields 3.9%.Bank of New York Mellon (BK)BK stock: Bank of New York Mellon logo on the side of a buildingSource: Chrispictures/Shutterstock.comBank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), more commonly called BNY Mellon, is one of the world’s largest custodian banks. It, along with just a couple of other American firms, hold a dominant position in this category.Custodian banks are attractive since they take minimal credit risk. Rather than relying on higher-risk loans for income, they earn a large portion of their revenues from charging fees for managing and safeguarding assets for governments, hedge funds, high net worth individuals and other such clients.As you might expect, returns on custodian banking tend to be lower, since it is a low-risk business. However, the sector is one of the leading beneficiaries of higher interest rates. Custodian banks get to earn more interest on certain types of funds, and also are enjoying things such as reduced fee waivers on some fixed income products. This should lead to rising profits for BNY Mellon as interest rates settle at much higher levels than we’ve previously seen.BK stock rallied to new highs in 2021. However, shares fell more than 23% last year, putting BNY Mellon back in the value bucket. Shares currently go for less than 10 times forward earnings and offer a 2.9% dividend yield.Eastman Chemical (EMN)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comEastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) is a specialty chemicals company. The firm came about as a spinoff from the film and photography leader Eastman Kodak. Over the years, Kodak has largely faded into irrelevancy, however, the Eastman Chemical business has remained a winner.Eastman Chemical has carved out a lane for itself by focusing on proprietary products where it has a technological edge and can charge higher prices compared to commodity chemicals.On top of that, American chemical suppliers have a big advantage in 2023. That’s due to how the industry works. Chemical companies rely on petroleum and natural gas as base ingredients for many of their products. Furthermore, chemical plants are energy-intensive and have high fuel expenses. American operators have a massive edge over European and Japanese rivals now that fuel prices have soared overseas, but natural gas remains cheap in the American heartland.Eastman Chemical is currently delivering tremendous profits thanks to advantageous conditions in the U.S. along with strong industrial demand. Regardless, EMN stock is down more than 25% over the past year as investors fret about a potential recession. This has put the stock at just 11 times forward earnings while offering a 3.6% dividend yield. Morningstar sees fair value way up at $130 per share versus today’s price of $89.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in VZ, EMN, VFC stock.

Why? A lot of that had to do with the outlook and the commentary that we got from CEOs on the call.So let's dig into some of these common themes. First up, we want to talk recession. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon shifting his tone. After warning of an economic hurricane last year, he's now calling for a mild recession, and he is far from the only one. We certainly heard that from Citi CEO Jane Fraser, also Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.Now Fraser went on to say that, ""We've built reserves in Personal Banking this quarter on the back of volume growth as well as that anticipation of a mild recession."" Moynihan went on to say that their baseline scenario contemplates a mild recession.So, Dave, recession was heard a number of times, but I guess if you want to take the optimistic view on this one, it's only mild.DAVE BRIGGS: What does that mean? Define that.SEANA SMITH: Hopefully it won't be that bad.DAVE BRIGGS: I suppose. I couldn't help but wonder if they coordinated this reference because you heard mild recession in just about all of the commentary from the big-bank CEOs. It seemed to be almost a coordinated message if you were just dropped down on this Earth.The one thing that really scared me, though, was Moynihan suggesting a 5% unemployment rate through '24 and a potential for a 5.5% unemployment rate, which is scary. Folks, we're at a 3 and 1/2% right now.JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon, we're all waiting on these words, and here's what he said. He's focused on geopolitical events. ""We still do not know the ultimate effect of headwinds coming from the geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine, the vulnerable state of energy and food supplies, persistent inflation that is eroding purchasing power and has pushed interest rates higher, as well as the unprecedented quantitative tightening.""Story continuesNow, what we didn't hear when he talked about geopolitical concerns is I wanted to hear something about reopening in China in terms of optimistic tailwinds. Didn't reference that when discussing all these events going on around the globe. Was a bit surprised. But again, he seems to agree on the side of mild recession.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and also the loan-loss reserves, right? That's a number that we've talked about--DAVE BRIGGS: That was a theme, yeah.SEANA SMITH: --very frequently over the last several quarters. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo all adding to that. JPMorgan actually adding $1.4 billion to loan-loss reserves in Q4. Bank of America provision for credit losses growing to $1.1 billion. Wells Fargo, $957 million. So there is some concern out there in terms of what we could see over the coming quarters.Consumer was another common theme just in terms of the strength of the consumer, maybe lack thereof. Although it was a little bit more upbeat and optimistic than I had anticipated that we would be hearing.DAVE BRIGGS: Wholeheartedly agree.SEANA SMITH: Dimon saying that the consumer's still in good shape. Brian Moynihan saying consumers, quote, ""have plenty of cushion left,"" although he did comment there, go further, saying that some of that spending growth is slowing a bit. When you take into account the higher prices, the looming recession, the fact that consumers have been holding up and actually stronger than we had anticipated, I think that's pretty good.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah. Moynihan did say credit-- outstanding credit balances up 14% year over year and did say delinquencies are beginning to rise.We expected-- at least I did-- expected to hear more about layoffs because we did hear the reporting that Goldman Sachs, who reports next week, will lay off 3,200. Didn't hear a whisper other than that, which I think was surprising and gives you some optimism going into the year when you thought you might follow suit from Goldman's.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly because I think a lot of us were bracing that we would hear about more cuts and layoffs here. But actually when you take a look at these headcount numbers, JPMorgan, Bank of America, both of those banks had higher headcounts than they did the previous quarter. Bank of America going on to say that they have no plans for job cuts at this point, so pretty optimistic when you take into account where we are today.DAVE BRIGGS: Absolutely. No question.]"

DCPH have rallied 70.2% in the past six months compared with the industry’s rise of 0.4%.The company’s sole marketed drug, Qinlock (ripretinib) is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (“GIST”) who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including Novartis’ NVS Gleevec (imatinib).NVS lost patent protection for Gleevec, which faces increasing generic competition in major markets.Qinlock has also been approved in Europe for treating fourth-line GIST, which is already generating incremental sales for the company.DCPH has made steady progress with Qinlock during this time, with the drug witnessing solid uptake so far. Qinlock contributes the majority of Deciphera’s revenues.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe initial uptake of Qinlock has been strong since its approval in May 2020. In the first nine months of 2022, Qinlock generated sales worth $92.6 million, reflecting an increase of 45.6% year over year.DCPH is also working to expand the label of Qinlock for the larger commercial opportunity in GIST. A potential label expansion for other indications will make the drug eligible to treat a broader patient population and drive sales further in the days ahead.Earlier this month, DCPH announced an outlook and planned corporate milestones for 2023.Per the outlook for 2023, the company plans to initiate the pivotal phase III INSIGHT study evaluating its sole marketed drug, Qinlock (ripretinib) compared with sunitinib for treating patients with GIST who were previously treated with Novartis’ Gleevec (imatinib) in the second half of 2023.This apart, Deciphera has a diverse pipeline and is advancing multiple drug candidates in various stages of clinical development.The company is evaluating its pipeline candidate vimseltinib in the phase III MOTION study to treat patients with tenosynovial giant-cell tumors, who are not amenable to surgery. Enrollment in the study is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023, with top-line data from the same expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.Story continuesDCPH plans to evaluate DCC-3116 in combination with Pfizer’s PFE Braftovi (encorafenib) and Eli Lilly’s Erbitux (cetuximab) for treating patients with colorectal cancer in the second half of 2023.Deciphera entered a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Pfizer for Braftovi.Per the above agreement, Deciphera will sponsor the study, whereas PFE will supply Braftovi free of cost.Deciphera currently has no approved product in its portfolio other than Qinlock. All of its candidates, including vimseltinib and DCC-3116, are still some time away from commercialization. As a result, the company is heavily dependent on Qinlock for growth. Any regulatory setbacks for the drug will hurt the company’s prospects.Qinlock also faces competition from Blueprint Medicines’ BPMC Ayvakit, which is approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic GIST, harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations in adults.Blueprint Medicines’ lead-marketed drug Ayvakit holds great potential. BPMC is also studying the drug in various label expansion studies for additional indications.Zacks RankDeciphera currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Paypal (PYPL).Paypal currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.56, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 32 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.56 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 32 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.8% and 6.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PYPLBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PYPLCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Paypal here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Paypal, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PYPL a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Paypal, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.08.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Paypal.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the same time, the Dow added 0.33%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.1%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the refiner had gained 9.15% over the past month. This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 5.03% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.01% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Marathon Petroleum as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 31, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Marathon Petroleum to post earnings of $5.88 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 352.31%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $32.19 billion, down 9.6% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Petroleum. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

GM wants to build 1 million EVs annually by 2025.Then there's Ford, the company already selling thousands of Mustang Mach-E's and Ford Lightning pickups right now. CEO Jim Farley splitting up the company through an EV business and a legacy gas power division to focus on the future. Ford says it aims to build 2 million EVs by 2026 when new factories come online. Then there's VW.The German giant leaning in hard with this ID sub-brand of cars, revealing the ID.7 just last week at CES. Volkswagen intends to have 25 new EVs in the market by 2025, and some of those models will be made right here in the USA, meaning they'll qualify for those all important federal tax cuts.BRAD SMITH: Now, in addition to competition, there's the issue of Elon Musk's empty promises in the past. So can he deliver on those, Pras?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, Brad, there's been a lot of vehicles here kind of brought up in the past-- Cybertruck. Cybertruck was debuted in 2019, was supposed to come out in 2021. We're going to-- but we will likely probably see it this year. We'll see.The Tesla Roadster, right-- this at least $200,000 supercar that came out-- again, debuted in 2019, we haven't heard much about when it's going to come out, and it's probably not going to come out for a while, and they've already taken huge deposits on that car. And, finally, the Gen 3 robotaxi, the cheap Tesla-- $25,000 Tesla that Elon Musk has talked about-- brought it up in 2020, said last year, actually, we're not going to make it, and now we're hearing that we're going to actually see a potential platform or what it actually might look like at their investor day on March 1. Again, if we see that, who knows when it will actually come out in the future?Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: Now, Pras, let's talk Tesla's car designs. Unpopular opinion-- I quite like the look of the Cybertruck. But while the overall designs are attractive for the other models, they are long due for a refresh, aren't they?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. Just looking at the models right now, they're all kind of long in the tooth. The Model S came out 10 years ago. Usually automakers every three to four years will have a refresh and then a full redesign in seven years, right? So the Model S came out 10 years ago.We saw a refresh of it last year. And the Model X SUV, that came out seven years ago-- again, a refresh last year. And the Model 3, it's been out for about six years or so. And we were hearing reports that they might actually update some interior components-- not a full refresh, a minor refresh.So these models are kind of still a little bit older. People are still buying them, but at a certain point when new cars come out, you might want to take a look at those.BRAD SMITH: Now, Pras, I'm old enough to remember when you scooped me from outside of our office in one of those luxury competitors out there in that Mercedes one. But there are plenty of other luxury competitors that are popping about. What do we know about those luxury competitors that are really entering into the fray?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, Brad, that's funny-- that was a fun day we had with the QS. But you know, Tesla doesn't break out the US sales, but ""Automotive News"" has new data that shows they actually passed BMW this year as the top luxury brand in the US overall, not just EVs.So, you know, Tesla's in a good, enviable spot there. But like you said, Mercedes with those EQS models-- Brad, I actually have the EQB SUV-- that's a small SUV, I'm picking it up later today to test that car. So that's a small EV SUV. So Mercedes coming on strong.BMW with the i4 and iX-- Audi with its E-trons, right? So there's a lot of competitors coming in the space, in the luxury EV space. And Tesla, like we said before, it used to have the run of the road by itself. Now, it's kind of being joined by a lot of new cars on the road itself.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And since this field is so crowded now, I mean, will people still be buying Teslas?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, Rachelle, I have to say, that is a, yes, because we've been just talking about earlier today about those big price cuts that are going to make these Model 3s and Model Ys come under that price cap for the IRA tax credit. That's a huge, huge kind of demand sort of push for them. You're going to see that happening just this quarter.But I think the biggest factor here, Rachelle is the charging network. The Tesla Supercharger network is still the best in the country, maybe even in the world. And I've been seeing a lot of reports people very upset with EV Go, Electrify America, all these other charging networks-- things broken, not enough chargers. You see plenty of Superchargers everywhere that you go, and they're usually empty, and they're pretty fast. So I think that's a huge factor here-- pricing and then also that charger network.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, great stuff-- Pras Subramanian there reporting for us.]"

195,850130e4-c68d-3f4d-a305-784eec9249d4,GM,2023-01-14,General Motors Company (GM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-company-gm-trending-140002455.html,1673618402,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this company have returned +1.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has lost 21.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of +21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.6%. This estimate has changed -3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of -17.9% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.54 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +23.7%. The $154.76 billion and $159.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.9% and +3.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $41.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.4%. EPS of $2.25 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.83 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +19.05%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

200,7e1f9b9b-bbea-37e4-b577-c14cafdb6e11,TGT,2023-01-14,The Returns At Target (NYSE:TGT) Aren't Growing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-target-nyse-tgt-arent-110118833.html,1673694078,STORY,['TGT'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Target's (NYSE:TGT) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Target:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$56b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Therefore, Target has an ROCE of 15%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for Target roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Target compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Target here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has employed 26% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 15%. 15% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Target has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.On a separate but related note, it's important to know that Target has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 43%, which we'd consider pretty high. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Target's ROCETo sum it up, Target has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 137% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Target   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should know about.While Target isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ISRG) At US$259?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-120106486.html,1673697666.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Intuitive Surgical’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical Is Intuitive Surgical Still Cheap?Intuitive Surgical is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Intuitive Surgical’s ratio of 66.39x is above its peer average of 34.03x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Medical Equipment industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Intuitive Surgical’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Intuitive Surgical generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 56% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Intuitive Surgical. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ISRG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ISRG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ISRG for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ISRG, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

The preliminary results drove down the shares of the company by 4.2% on Jan 11.The company is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter results on Jan 24, 2023.Per the preliminary report, fourth-quarter 2022 worldwide revenues are likely to be $1.66 billion, suggesting an increase of 7% year over year on a reported basis. The preliminary revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimates.The company’s instruments and accessories revenues are likely to be approximately $941 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% from the prior-year period. The da Vinci procedures increased 18% year over year.The instruments and accessories revenues were driven by higher procedure volume, which was partially offset by customer buying patterns and foreign currency impacts. Procedure volume was driven by growth in U.S. general surgery and cancer procedures in ex-U.S. markets. However, procedure volume was hurt in China due to resurgence of COVID-19 in the country. The company expects adverse impact of COVID-19 on procedure volumes to continue in 2023.Preliminary systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 is likely to be approximately $451 million, down 4% year over year.This compares to our projection of fourth quarter revenues of $460.8 million, representing a decline of 1.9%.The company placed 369 da Vinci Surgical systems in the fourth quarter of 2022, down from 385 systems in the year-ago period. Among the system placements during the fourth quarter, 153 were placed under operating lease and usage-based arrangements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.24 million lies above the preliminary figure.Story continuesThe instruments and accessories revenue for the full year is expected to be $3.52 billion, reflecting a growth of 13% year over year. Systems revenue declined 1% to $1.68 billion as the company placed fewer systems during 2022 compared to 2021.A Brief Q4 AnalysisIntuitive Surgical’s procedure volumes have increased in the past few quarter and the trend also continued into the fourth quarter. The company’s procedure volumes were primarily driven by general surgery and cancer procedures.However, COVID-19 continues to hamper demand in countries where it is still prevailing.

RCL has been benefiting from digital initiatives, expanded onboard offerings and fleet expansion efforts. Also, the rise in close-in bookings and better-than-expected load factors have been driving sales improvement over the last few quarters.Shares of Royal Caribbean have surged 40% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 24.4% growth. The price performance was backed by a solid earnings surprise history. Royal Caribbean’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 have moved up 3.5% in the past 60 days. This positive trend signifies bullish analysts’ sentiments and justifies the company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Factors Driving GrowthRoyal Caribbean continues using digital tools for marketing, product development and enhancing the consumer experience. The initiative plays a vital role in supporting the enhancement of customer preference, engagement, cruise frequency, guest experience and spending. The company has introduced new technological capabilities under its Project Excalibur. It has also rolled out a smartphone app to increase convenience and better serve guests. In addition to industry-wide trends, several unique factors are boosting the company’s numbers. Streaming WiFi, expanded onboard offerings, customized destination experiences and other ship upgrades are also paying off.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring the third quarter of 2022, the company reported early consumer engagement, with about 60% purchasing onboard experiences before the sailings. This represents an 8-point increase in penetration and much higher revenue (related to pre-cruise purchases) from 2019 levels. The company focuses on new innovative ships and onboard experiences to boost its offering and deliver superior yields and margins.On the supply front, the company is steadfast in increasing its capacity to meet rising demand. Moving into 2023, the company has three ships scheduled for delivery — Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova. The company stated that Icon will have eight distinct neighborhoods and that its stateroom configuration will allow for load factors to be accretive to the overall portfolio. Also, it reported a solid market response in terms of bookings for the ship. The company anticipates the ship to be significantly accretive to its key financial metrics.Royal Caribbean has been benefiting from strong demand for cruising, relaxation in COVID-related protocols and acceleration in booking volumes. During the third quarter, booking volumes for 2022 sailings were up 50% from the 2019 levels. During the third quarter, the company reported accelerating demand for sailings in 2023. It stated that booking volumes for 2023 doubled during the third quarter compared with the second quarter of 2022.The company noted better than expected load factors, owing to a rise in close-in bookings. It also stated that pricing (including and excluding FCCs) remains elevated from 2019 levels. As of Sep 30, 2022, the company had nearly $3.8 billion in customer deposits. During the quarter, the company witnessed a rise in new bookings and fewer FCC redemptions. Given the full fleet resumption and load factors (at approximately 95%), the company expects customer deposits to return to typical seasonality in the upcoming periods.Story continuesOther Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis holding company for Regions Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +47.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.94 billion, up 18.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.92% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regions Financial?For Regions Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.77%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Regions Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Regions Financial would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.56, delivering a surprise of -5.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Regions Financial doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, United Community Banks (UCBI), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.83 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +29.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $239.5 million, up 37.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for United Community Banks has been revised 3.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.73%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that United Community Banks will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As an industry we’ve already bought them, at a cost of billions of dollars, a gift that’s genuinely priceless and always in style: the smug self-satisfaction of knowing they were always right.After all that happened in 2022, it would be nice to know that we’re busy learning all the right and important lessons. Don’t count on it. Thanks to the miracle of confirmation bias, those advocating proof of reserves, auditing or just the end of the crypto will see the events of the year as confirmation that we need to do whatever it was they were already pitching. I’m no exception: ya’ll need more audits.Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 package.As for myself, I write this in a dark mood not because exchanges and hedge funds have collapsed, nor because bad people are going free, having fully apologized on Twitter, and I’m not frustrated by the possibility that caution by customers and regulators could slow the growth of this amazing technology. No indeed. What I’m frustrated with is the slow progress of public blockchains, privacy technology and industrial applications. There’s so much more to blockchain than crypto and we’re just not getting there fast enough.As we move forward I see three challenges that we should have progressed past but somehow haven’t managed to do. The first is the blockchain program of speed-running the history of financial regulation by making all the mistakes and skipping any useful lessons that former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke may have learned, and for which he won a Nobel Prize. Over and over again we have seen compelling evidence that poorly regulated or unregulated financial entities are at risk for bank runs and that financial services pose systemic risks to the rest of the economic ecosystem.Every time one of these events happens the response of crypto purists is to declare that only decentralized finance works and that must be the path ahead. This is folly. Creating an ultra-low-risk financial system that runs only on-chain will defeat the entire purpose of capital markets: to channel capital to risk-takers who can use it to build businesses. The moment you take risk you enter in the space of human judgment and away from strict algorithms.Story continuesRead more: Paul Brody - Why Blockchains Are as Important as ERP for the Future of CompaniesThe second disappointment is our slow progress around the world on well-organized blockchain and cryptocurrency regulations. Enforcement actions against bad actors make sense, but in the absence of positive rules they also have a chilling effect on good actors who would like to enter the business but are afraid of finding themselves on the wrong side of rules that have yet to be set. I’m not speculating here. I know. EY serves multiple blue chip financial institutions that are waiting for clarity before they enter the stablecoin and crypto space.So, we’re now in a less than ideal situation. Bad actors are undeterred by the lack of regulation, but good actors are. The result: Bad actors face far less competition. It’s not, thankfully, zero competition. There are quite a lot of good actors in this space, but due to absent regulatory clarity and standards even those players are having a hard time differentiating themselves from the bad guys. Every bad actor claims they’re audited, professionally run and take compliance seriously, and few end-users know enough to tell the truth from fiction.Blue chip financial institutions are waiting for clarity before they enter the stablecoin and crypto space.Lastly, a looming recession and an endless stream of crypto failures is trimming budgets and enthusiasm for risk-takers in the industrial space. It’s hard enough convincing risk-averse chief investment officers to bet on emerging technologies; it gets even harder as they contemplate slashing budgets in the face of a potential recession.Read more: Jeff Wilser and Xinyi Luo - 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023If there is a silver lining to the probability that we will learn no useful lessons from this difficult time, it is that progress for public blockchains, for Ethereum and for privacy technology is inevitable. Nothing that has happened this year has made private and permissioned blockchains any more useful or interesting. Along the way, lots of good things are happening as well. I want to pick out three from 2022:First, the Merge. The people of Ethereum put to rest any more ideas that they can’t run globally important infrastructure. The orderly shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake blew away, with one stroke, two of the biggest complaints enterprises had about Ethereum: that there is no clear accountability to responsibly manage the system and that it generates too large a carbon footprint. The battle for layer one is over and Ethereum won.Second, non-fungible tokens. The market for speculative generative art has largely deflated, but the market for enduring and transferable personal digital trophies, proof of attendance and collectibles is just getting started. NFTs will soon be everywhere for everything from concert tickets to race medals. It’s not about making money. It’s about collecting the story of your life and accomplishments and sharing them with the world. NFTs have immense industrial applications as well. Most things companies make are unique, even if that’s just the batch number or serial number. That’s still an NFT, not a fungible token.Finally, DAOs. Decentralized autonomous organizations are a ray of sunshine in the blockchain ecosystem. They are emerging as a vehicle for people to build and organize just about everything, from new companies to shared investment vehicles to non-profit charities. This year they started to accelerate, with a wide range of tools and services making it easy for just about anyone to set up and start managing a DAO.2022 is over, and that’s a relief. The building goes on and the bad actors of this year will soon just be quiz show trivia questions. Onwards.]"

The peso slid 0.5% against the greenback, as prices of the red metal, of which Chile is a top producer, took a breather following their sharp rally this week. Latin American currencies have gained 2.8% so far this week and were on track for their second week of gains, in an upbeat start to January and 2023. Peru's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.75% on Thursday, as the nation battles the highest inflation in a quarter of a century. ""Although inflation has already shown signs of slowing, it has been without conviction, and the central bank will seek to ensure that inflation returns to the target range,"" said Mario Guerrero, deputy head economist for Peru at Scotiabank. Thousands took to the streets of Peru's capital Lima in a peaceful protest against the new government and president, after weeks of bloody clashes triggered by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo left at least 42 dead. ""In the near-term, the protests could put further upward pressure on inflation,"" William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note. ""Peru has been one of the fastest growing economies in the region over the past few decades, but it's hard to see that continuing."" The sol has lagged peers so far this year, up just 0.3%, compared to other Latin American currencies gaining nearly 3% each. Peru's economy likely grew slightly less than 2.9% last year, a senior central bank official said, suggesting that the South American country's economy expanded less than previously forecast, due in part to an explosion of social unrest that began in December. Brazil's real was flat against the dollar. Data showed economic activity in Brazil fell more than expected in November, in the fourth straight month of contraction. Shares of Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras fell more than 1%. The government has officially nominated Jean Paul Prates to serve as its chief executive officer and board member, the company said. The Colombian peso dipped 0.1% on Friday, and has added 3.5% so far this week. Emerging market bonds are off to a roaring start to the new year. Developing countries have sold $39 billion worth of international bonds since the start of 2023, with investors happy to pile into riskier debt as they bet global interest rates are nearing a peak.

But that's what happened at the Dow Jones offices this week.News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson sent a note to staff on Thursday echoing demands for employees to return to the office—headquartered in Midtown New York—at least three days a week. The memo, leaked to Insider and in which Thomson called in-office attendance ""an absolute imperative,"" came the day after Dow Jones laid off a reported 2% of staff, including 22 union-represented employees.News Corp. declined to comment at this time.https://twitter.com/swodinsky/status/1613211102208204800Dow Jones is a division of News Corp. and operates the likes of the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, and MarketWatch. All the aforementioned publications, including the New York Post, are housed in the same building at 1211 Avenue of the Americas.The Wall Street Journal, which has followed the moves of its peer publication across Times Square, separately drew a line in the sand on RTO plans in September after the New York Times’ own RTO mandates floundered. The Journal told staff they would be expected to return to the office three days a week starting Nov. 1.It's rather apparent that hasn't happened to the extent the company hoped, because in Thomson's note this week, he called on executives across the entire company to consult with managers who would be expected to ""ensure full compliance.""""There is some room for flexibility in the work environment, but that flexibility is not boundless,"" he added.It should also be noted that News Corp.'s latest push to get folks back to their desks comes after it just renewed its lease agreement for its Midtown headquarters.Story continuesThe forceful hand of RTO mandate after laying off somewhere between 120 and 150 people isn't exactly a cheery message.Companies have tried to entice employees back with pizza, lunch boxes, happy hours, and any number of corporate out-of-touch isms. Thomson leaned heavily into the idea of a lost company culture and the idea that ""screens deny us the subtleties of body language and the nuances of knowing glances. The spontaneity and serendipity of a dynamic office environment.""Gallup consultants Nikki Morin and Heather Barrett wrote last year about the idea that bringing employees physically together cultivates some sort of important social bond that simply can't be replicated in a digital, virtual world.“The reality,"" they wrote, ""is that the office never equaled culture.

Management is on track with its Value Creation model.The company is working on its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives. The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs, beside helping Snap-on boost sales and margins, and generate savings. Savings from the RCI initiative reflect gains from continuous productivity and process improvement plans.Management intends to boost customer services, and enhance manufacturing and supply-chain capabilities through the RCI initiatives and further investments.Snap-on’s ability to innovate bodes well. The company has been investing in new products and increasing brand awareness across the world.Its robust business model helps in enhancing the value-creation processes, which improves safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation. The company’s growth strategy focuses on three critical areas, namely enhancing the franchise network, improving relationships with repair shop owners and managers, and expanding critical industries in emerging markets.Driven by these factors, Snap-on has been witnessing a robust surprise trend, which continued in third-quarter 2022. Its top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, marking the ninth straight earnings beat and the 10th consecutive sales surprise. Earnings and sales improved year over year. Adjusted earnings of $4.14 per share improved 16% from earnings of $3.57 reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales grew 6.2% to $1,102.5 million, driven by organic sales growth of 10.4%.Higher sales volume and gains from the RCI initiatives boosted margins in the third quarter. The company’s operating earnings before financial services totaled $223.5 million, up 11% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 90 bps to 20.3% in the third quarter. Consolidated operating earnings (including financial services) were $289.9 million, up 6.6% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings expanded 20 bps to 24.4%.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 18.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 20.3%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, the company continues to reel under potential threats of new COVID-19 variants and supply-chain headwinds. Rising cost inflation, stemming from higher raw material expenses and increased transportation costs, is likely to be a deterrent.Also, the unfavorable currency is concerning. In third-quarter 2022, the company’s sales were affected by an unfavorable foreign currency of $39.1 million. Sales in the Commercial &amp; Industrial Group, Tools Group, and Repair Systems &amp; Information Group segments included $20.8 million, $8.9 million and $11.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, respectively.Bottom LineSnap-on’s cost-cutting efforts, RCI plan and solid business momentum are likely to help sustain its momentum and offset inflation and currency woes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Snap-on’s 2022 sales and EPS suggests growth of 5.6% and 10.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Topping it, a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.9% reflects its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Hilton Grand Vacations HGV, World Wrestling Entertainment WWE and Hyatt Hotels H.World Wrestling Entertainment currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three stocks over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.AppleWe’re all familiar with the legendary Apple, the company that’s entirely changed the mobile phone landscape, among many others. Currently, the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Apple is one of the biggest cash generators within the S&amp;P 500; in its latest release, the company posted free cash flow of a sizable $20.8 billion, reflecting a sizable 23% Y/Y change.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company pays a small dividend, currently yielding 0.7% annually. While the yield is on the lower side, Apple’s 6.8% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to bridge the gap.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon CommunicationsVerizon, one of the largest wireless carriers, offers communication and data services in various forms. As it stands, VZ is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In Verizon’s Q3, the company generated $5.2 billion in free cash flow. As we can see in the chart below, the company’s free cash flow has started to recover from 2022 lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA significant perk of VZ shares is the dividend; Verizon’s annual dividend yields a sizable 6.2%, well above its Zacks Computer and Technology average.Story continuesAnd over the last five years, the company’s payout has grown by 2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlphabetAnother legendary company operating in the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Alphabet, has quickly become an investor favorite. GOOGL is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Google parent generated $16.1 billion in free cash flow in its latest quarter, good enough for a sizable 28% sequential increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company’s valuation multiples have pulled back extensively; GOOGL shares currently trade at an 18X forward earnings multiple, nowhere near the 26.3X five-year median and nicely beneath its Zacks sector average.Alphabet carries a Style Score of “B” for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineSearching for stocks can be overwhelming, with way too many options to sort through.However, focusing on a company’s cash-generating abilities is a great initial screen for those interested in filtering out companies with a weak financial standing.All three stocks above – Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, and Verizon Communications VZ – carry remarkable cash-generating abilities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TRV targets mid-teens ROE over the long term.Business TailwindsRiding on strong net earned premiums and an aggregate underlying combined ratio for Business Insurance and Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, strong underwriting results continued in the commercial businesses. High levels of retention, improved pricing, an increase in new business and a positive renewal premium change should continue to drive Travelers.TRV expects domestic automobile renewal premium change to be in double digits in the fourth quarter and be in the mid-teens throughout 2023.Travelers projected nearly $540 million on average per quarter in 2023 with an estimated $515 million in the first quarter.

(NYSE:APD)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-air-products-130037571.html,1673701237,STORY,['APD'],"[Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Air Products and Chemicals’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals What's The Opportunity In Air Products and Chemicals?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 30.81x is currently well-above the industry average of 15.06x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. In addition to this, it seems like Air Products and Chemicals’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Air Products and Chemicals generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Air Products and Chemicals' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 44%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? APD’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe APD should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on APD for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for APD, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.33%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.1%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the engine maker had gained 6.01% over the past month.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.34 billion, up 25.41% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Cummins.

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Investors in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 35%. That's well below the market decline of 15%. Even if you look out three years, the returns are still disappointing, with the share price down31% in that time. On the other hand, we note it's up 9.8% in about a month.On a more encouraging note the company has added US$10.0b to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the one-year loss for shareholders. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Walt Disney share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 58%. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Walt Disney managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalt Disney is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Walt Disney shareholders are down 35% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 15%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.5% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Before forming an opinion on Walt Disney you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.Story continuesWe will like Walt Disney better if we see some big insider buys.

We have Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Disney, and WWE. The big story-- stock stories of the week. So let's kick it off with Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Over the past five days, we're looking at gains of about 179%.Now these gains coming despite the fact that the retailer warned that it may need to file for bankruptcy. The New York Times reporting today that Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond is in talks with Sycamore Partners to sell assets, including its Bye-Bye Baby stores as part of a possible bankruptcy process. Yet the stock's still closing the week in the green. Now this excitement is spilling over to some of those other meme stocks.And take a look at this, GameStop, AMC, and Carvana on a five-day basis for the week. You're looking at GameStop up 24%, AMC up 31%, Carvana up 59%. Certainly not really trading when you take a look at those companies' fundamentals.Let's take a look at Disney, a big week here for the company, a proxy fight brewing between Nelson Peltz after denying the activist investor a board seat. Now Peltz's firm called Disney a, quote, ""company in crisis."" Also said that its problems are self-inflicted and that they need to be addressed. The push is for Disney to cut costs and also turn a profit for its streaming service. The company also named a Nike executive chairman, Mark Parker, to its next chairman. As its next chairman, he will replace Susan Arnold.And let's round it out with WWE, another big story for the week. The stock closing the week in the green, up just about 6%. Vince McMahon is now back at the company, getting appointed as executive chairman this week, as the WWE considers a possible sale. Now McMahon returns after stepping down last year amid sexual assault allegations. Vince's return comes as his daughter Stephanie McMahon leaves the company, announcing her resignation.So who could buy WWE? Something that we've been talking about this week, there's a number of names being rumored. And here are a couple of them. Saudi Arabia's public investment fund is one, Comcast, Endeavor, and the Jaguars owner Shad Khan there. So we will see, Dave, what happens with WWE, but some excitement that we saw in the stock, especially when we saw it peak on Tuesday. But again, closing the week at 89.40 a share.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it's a very interesting story to watch. I'm not ruling out the Saudis. It was not true earlier this week. It still feels likely they've hired Raine Group to sell potentially all of that company, a big performer.]"

HP recently overtook the 50-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.One of the three major moving averages, the 50-day simple moving average is commonly used by traders and analysts to determine support or resistance levels for different types of securities. However, the 50-day is considered to be more important since it's the first marker of an up or down trend.HP has rallied 5.8% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests HP could be on the verge of another move higher.Looking at HP's earnings estimate revisions, investors will be even more convinced of the bullish uptrend. There have been 8 higher compared to none lower for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Investors may want to watch HP for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is expected to deliver sales and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, indicating a 5.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For fiscal second-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $20.57 billion, suggesting a 1.8% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.We expect the company’s fiscal second-quarter total revenues to decline 4.6% year over year to $20,065.3 million and the bottom line to dip 5.4% to $1.57 per share.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 1.3%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 1.05%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price and EPS Surprise Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price and EPS SurpriseProcter &amp; Gamble Company The price-eps-surprise | Procter &amp; Gamble Company The QuoteKey Factors to NoteProcter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing higher freight, and commodity and input material cost inflation, which have been affecting its performance. The company’s gross margin for the fiscal second quarter is likely to have been under pressure, driven by the continued impacts of commodity and input material cost inflation, higher freight costs, negative product mix and other impacts, and increased product and packaging investments. Currency movements are expected to have negatively impacted all-in sales growth and earnings per share in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, Procter &amp; Gamble predicted higher commodity and freight costs to persist throughout fiscal 2023. Our estimate indicates a 4.7% year-over-year decline in gross profit for the fiscal second quarter, with the gross margin contracting 30 bps. We estimate a 6.1% decline in operating income in the fiscal second quarter, with the operating margin contracting 50 bps. This is likely to translate into a bottom-line decline in the to-be-reported quarter.Currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have weighed on the fiscal second-quarter performance. Our estimate indicates a 6% impact from currency headwinds in the fiscal second quarter.However, Procter &amp; Gamble has been gaining from improved productivity and persistent demand for cleaning products. The company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the benefits of continued strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which have been aiding organic sales growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for organic sales growth is pegged at 4.9%.The company has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans, which have been aiding its margins. PG has been witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of its business, driven by the productivity program. Its continued business investments and efforts to offset macro cost headwinds, and balanced top and bottom-line growth underscore its productivity efforts. Gains from productivity savings and pricing are expected to have aided margins and the bottom line in the fiscal second quarter.Moreover, the company is likely to have witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Procter &amp; Gamble this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, this is not the case here.

244,db2b3a2a-3558-3031-8692-99fc7d9ee852,CMCSA,2023-01-14,Shareholders in Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) are in the red if they invested a year ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-comcast-nasdaq-cmcsa-red-130031788.html,1673701231,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[While it may not be enough for some shareholders, we think it is good to see the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) share price up 30% in a single quarter. But in truth the last year hasn't been good for the share price. In fact the stock is down 25% in the last year, well below the market return.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Unfortunately Comcast reported an EPS drop of 62% for the last year. The share price fall of 25% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So despite the weak per-share profits, some investors are probably relieved the situation wasn't more difficult.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Comcast's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Comcast's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Comcast, it has a TSR of -22% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Comcast shareholders are down 22% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 15%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 0.5%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Comcast , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Sign-in options will appear for both Xfinity customers and non-customers.Xfinity Internet customers can sign in with their account credentials and they will be automatically connected to Xfinity WiFi hotspots in their range in the future. Alternatively, they can download the Xfinity WiFi Hotspots app and sign in with their account credentials.Non-Xfinity Internet subscribers need to look for the “Get Connected” section and agree to the Terms and Conditions to be connected. Non-customers will be able to renew their complimentary sessions every 2 hours.**Please note that if a user does not see the “Accept and Connect” button, the hotspot he or she is trying to connect to is in an Xfinity customer’s home and is not open to the public.There are also a few simple, easy things customers can do now to prepare and stay connected, even in bad weather. They can start by downloading Comcast’s free mobile apps:Xfinity My Account — Get updates on outages and report service interruptions.Xfinity Stream — View live TV, get weather updates, and download shows and movies beforehand to watch offline in case you lose power.Xfinity WiFi Hotspots — Xfinity Internet customers can access millions of Xfinity WiFi hotspots available nationwide.Comcast may also send text alerts to customers with information about service interruptions or with tips for restoring their services. Customers can log in to the Xfinity App to make sure their mobile phone numbers are added.Story continuesHere are a few additional helpful tips and safety precautions:Customers should plug TV’s, modems, and cable boxes into a surge protector to protect them from damage in case of lightning or a sudden power outage.Emergency management procedures dictate that electricity must be restored first and Comcast must receive clearance that it is safe for our crews to begin any restoration work. Should customers experience a loss of service due to a power outage, local power must first be restored before Xfinity video, phone or internet services can begin working again.If customers have electricity but not Xfinity services, Comcast recommends restarting or resetting devices, including wireless gateways, modems, routers, and cable boxes.In some cases, customers may have power back but not their Xfinity services because commercial power has not been restored to our network in that area.Customers should always stay clear of downed power and cable lines in the interest of safety.Forward a home phone number to a mobile phone number so that customers can receive emergency calls even if they are not home.Tips for Comcast Business customers:Download the Comcast Business App and enable Be Anywhere to allow another device to make calls with a business’s Caller ID.Enable Call Forwarding so business calls can be received on mobile devices.Check that the battery backup is working so Voice Services will still be available during a power outage.Make sure Connection Pro services are set up correctly.

The bulls are now fighting to push the S&amp;P 500 back above its 200-day moving average. This technical level proved to be a stubborn point of resistance for much of 2022, and now the market faces the unknowns of the fourth quarter earnings season.U.S. inflation fell to 6.5% in December to match Wall Street expectations and come in below November’s 7.1%. The recent CPI reading marked the sixth straight monthly deceleration after inflation hit 9.1% in June.  Wall Street upped its bet that the Fed will only lift its core interest rate by 0.25% at its next FOMC meeting at the end of January from 77% on Wednesday to 95% on Friday.Wall Street appears to be growing increasingly confident that the Fed won’t have to do much more to cool inflation. Still, it is always worth considering the dissenting views, and remember that Jay Powell remains steadfast in his mission to drag inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target range.Given how far inflation is from the Fed’s target range and how much the 2023 earnings outlook has already faded could mean investors should stick to stocks that proved themselves during last year’s turbulent market.Here are two highly-ranked value stocks that crushed the market in 2022 and are poised to post sales and revenue growth next year as well. And both stocks just hit fresh highs amid the market volatility.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Jabil (JBL) Jabil provides manufacturing services to companies in telecommunications and other industries. The firm’s client list includes the likes of Apple, SolarEdge, and other giants in critical and game-changing industries.Jabil prides itself on operating in the background. The firm works with hundreds of the biggest brands in the world to help make everything from smartphones and home appliances to high-tech healthcare equipment. JBL is also set to benefit from a broader onshoring/reshoring push from U.S. companies and the federal government.Story continuesJabil’s diversification helped it grow steadily for years, including 14% growth in its fiscal 2022. JBL topped our Q1 FY23 earnings and revenue estimates on December 15 and upped its guidance once again, which continues to be highly impressive given the economic outlook. JBL’s bottom-line positivity helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks estimates call for JBL’s revenue to climb 3% in both FY23 and FY24 to hit $35.5 billion. This growth comes on top 12% average sales expansion over the last five years. Jabil’s adjusted earnings are projected to climb by 9% and 6%, respectively during this same stretch.Jabil’s industry currently ranks in the top 1% of over 250 Zacks industries, and six of the seven brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys.” Jabil’s dividend yields 0.4% at the moment. Plus, JBL shares surged to new highs on Friday, up 50% in the last six months and 70% in the past two years vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s -17% drop.Despite trading at new highs and its long-term and recent outperformance, Jabil trades at a 50% discount to the Zacks Tech sector at 9.8X forward 12-month earnings. This also represents a 15% discount to its own 10-year median and 45% below its highs.United Rentals (URI)United Rentals is one of the world’s largest equipment rental firms. URI’s portfolio allows its customers, which include construction firms, utility companies, municipalities, and beyond, to rent scissor lifts, towable light towers, generators, and nearly everything else under the sun. The firm’s revenue was booming prior to the pandemic, with sales up between 15% to 21% for three straight years until they slipped in 2020.United Rentals quickly bounced back to post 14% growth in 2021 to see it top its pre-pandemic totals. Despite the economic slowdown, Zacks estimates call for URI’s sales to soar 20% in 2022 and another 12% in 2023 to reach $13 billion as it is able to grow its customer base and raise its rental prices to adapt to inflation.  United Rentals is also projected to post 48% adjusted earnings growth in 2022 and another 15% higher EPS in 2023. Plus, it has continually upped guidance over the last year, with its improved EPS outlook for FY22 and FY23 helping it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI shares have climbed 20% over the past 12 months vs. its industry’s -17% fall. This run includes a 41% surge in the past three months that saw it hit fresh highs on Thursday, January 12. United Rentals stock has also crushed the market and its industry over the last decade, up a whopping 680% vs. its industry’s 120% and the market’s 170%.Even though United Rentals sits right near fresh highs, it trades at a 40% discount to its own decade-long highs at 10.5X forward 12-month earnings and right at its own median. URI also trades at a 37% discount to its own industry despite its huge outperformance.Plus, URI authorized a new share repurchase program back in October. United Rentals also completed its acquisition of Ahern Rentals in early December to boost its reach, customer base, and beyond. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about McDonald's (MCD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 52.2% and 13% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying McDonald's, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in MCD?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $9.93.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for McDonald's may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Subject to customary closing conditions, the acquisition is likely to get completed by the first quarter of 2023.Following the buyout, American Express intends to leverage the power of Nipendo’s workforce, technology and capabilities to construct an innovative business payments network.AXP seems to be prudent in its decision of acquiring Nipendo, owing to the lucrative benefits fetched by the platform of the latter. Without requiring a company’s payment infrastructure to undergo any change, Nipendo’s platform boasts the capability to inject additional automation within a company’s current systems.The buyout announcement is indicative of American Express’ continuous efforts to bring about simpler, speedier and transparent B2B payments. Simultaneously, AXP keeps an eye to bolster its suite of B2B offerings through the latest acquisition.The strength of Nipendo’s platform will also offer an opportunity for more business clients to interact and increasingly engage in transactions across the Amex network. Consequently, more business customers will turn to leverage the B2B offering portfolio of AXP, which in turn, is expected to boost its customer base. Time and again, American Express has resorted to moves in the form of new product launches, mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) as well as collaborations to build a powerful end-to-end B2B platform. Its acquisitions of acompay back in 2019 and partnerships with BillTrust and Versapay (both of which are Average Receivable companies) last year bears testament to the same.In December 2022, American Express launched a B2B payments solution Amex Business Link to enable its network participants to conduct seamless B2B payments, thus saving time and costs.In an evolving digital era wherein businesses are compelled to infuse digitization into their operations, the decision to take the help of the cloud-based platform of Nipendo to integrate automation within the systems of business clients seems to be time opportune. Apart from bringing about accelerated B2B payments, the latest buyout can also help American Express to save time and costs stemming from age-old paper-based processes related to management of order processes and supply chain as well as addressing disparities and invoice reconciliation.Story continuesShares of American Express have gained 13.5% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 2.4% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAXP currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked stocks in the Finance space are Civista Bancshares, Inc.

256,a26b288c-c61a-3776-bafd-6033012e55c9,AXP,2023-01-14,"Credit card points, miles, and cash back—how to choose the best rewards program for your needs",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-card-points-miles-cash-173200058.html,1673631120,STORY,['AXP'],"[Cash back cards allow cardholders to earn a percentage of cash back on every dollar you spend, usually anywhere between 1% and 5%, although some cards may go even higher for specific purchases at qualifying merchants. These rewards are typically offered in one of three ways:Flat-rate cards: This is the simplest kind of cash back system. Cash back cards that offer the same percentage rate, no matter the purchase. The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, for example, offers 2% cash rewards on all eligible purchases.Tiered-rate cards: These cards tend to offer higher cash back rates, but only for certain categories. For example, the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express gives cardholders 3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets, on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%), 3% on U.S. online retail purchases on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%), and 3% on gas at U.S. gas stations, on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%). All other eligible purchases earn 1% cash back. This card has no annual fee. (Terms apply, see rates and fees.)Rotating categories: These cards offer different bonus categories that rotate monthly or quarterly and may require the cardholder to manually activate these offers online or via mobile app. The Citi Custom CashSM Card offers 5% cash back on your top spend category per billing cycle up to $500, then 1% cash back thereafter.So, say you spend $100 at the grocery store and your card offers 2% cash back for those kinds of purchases. You’d earn $2 cash back. That may not sound like a lot, but it adds up over time especially when you’re making frequent trips to the grocery store.Sometimes you can earn extra cash back during the first year of card membership. The Chase Freedom Unlimited®, for example, is offering new cardholders an additional 1.5% on all purchases up to $20,000 spent in the first year: unlimited 3% cash back on all eligible purchases, 4.5% on dining and at drugstores, and 6.5% on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.Story continues“These cards typically allow cardholders to redeem in the form of a statement credit, check, or transfer to a bank account. Some cards are also linked to the issuer's rewards program and can be converted to points,” says Paramita Pal, head of U.S. bankcard product management and external acquisition at TD Bank.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comPro: Cash can be used for any purchase. Earning cash rewards for your purchases offers a lot of flexibility and lets you decide how and where you want to spend your rewards. “Cash back rewards are often enjoyed by consumers looking for ease, simplicity, and flexibility,” says Pal. “We saw an uptick in interest in cash back cards during the pandemic, when consumer spending shifted from travel and experiences to at-home activities and purchases. The flexibility provided consumers an opportunity to earn rewards while spending across categories as their priorities changed.”Con: There may be a cap on how much cash back you can earn. Some cards may have limits on how much you can earn in cash back over a certain period of time. It’s important to read the fine print when comparing cards to determine how quickly you might reach that limit depending on your spending habits.What are credit card points?Credit card points work similarly to cash back in that you typically earn a certain number of points per dollar on specific purchases. For example, the Platinum Card® from American Express offers 5X Membership Rewards® Points on flights booked directly with airlines or through American Express Travel, on up to $500,000 on these purchases per calendar year, 5X points on prepaid hotels booked with American Express Travel, and 1X points on all other purchases. The Platinum Card has a $695 annual fee. (Terms apply, see rates and fees.)Points work differently than cash back, because you typically get the most value when you redeem them for specific purchases, like travel.“Miles are most frequently redeemed toward airline loyalty programs, and spending on travel related purchases can accelerate the process of earning miles. Whereas points have a wider array of redemption possibilities inclusive of hotels, dining, entertainment, fuel, online merchandisers, and more,” says John Lazzati, managing director, consumer cards at Goldman Sachs.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comPro: Credit cards that offer rewards points could save you more than if you’d redeemed cash. Depending on your specific card, your credit card points could be worth more than $1 per point—offering you more value than if you’d been rewarded in cash.Con: Some rewards cards have higher annual fees. While there are some rewards cards that have no annual fee, there are many that have fees upwards of $500.What are miles? When you use a miles-based credit card you earn a certain number of miles for every dollar you spend or every dollar you spend within a certain category. Some major airlines like American Airlines and Delta have co-branded credit cards with credit card issuers like Citi and American Express. The American Airlines AAdvantage MileUp℠ Card offered by Citi rewards cardholders with 2X AAdvantage miles for each $1 spent at grocery stores, including grocery delivery services, as well as 2X AAdvantage miles for every $1 spent on eligible American Airlines purchases, and 1X AAdvantage mile for every $1 spent on other purchases. There’s no annual fee.The Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card rewards cardholders with 2X miles on Delta purchases, at U.S. supermarkets and at restaurants worldwide (including takeout and delivery in the U.S.), as well as 1X mile on all other eligible purchases. There’s $0 introductory annual fee the first year, then $99. (Terms apply, see rates and fees.)If you want a miles card that’s not tied to a specific airline, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card offers cardholders 5X miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel and unlimited 2X miles on all other eligible purchases. The card has a $95 annual fee.""For those who intend to use their rewards primarily for travel, miles are a great choice as they can often be used to cover the cost of flights, hotels, car rentals, cruises, dining and status upgrades,” says Pal.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comPro: You can be rewarded for brand loyalty. If you have a preferred airline or hotel chain that you regularly book with, a miles-based rewards system can help you save and earn perks from those specific merchants.Con: Maximizing the value of your miles requires you to be a frequent traveler. If you like to travel, but don’t get to do it that often, it could take you some time to rack up enough rewards to see significant savings.How to choose the right type of card for yourself When comparing credit card options, you’ll want to consider a few different factors to make sure you select the right card.Potential fees and other limitations: Shop around and read the fine print associated with each card you’re considering. Learn about what kinds of fees you may incur, if there are caps on the cash, points, or miles you can earn, or minimum amounts to redeem those rewards.Each card’s APR: Rewards credit cards tend to have higher annual percentage rates (APR) than other credit cards. If you’re the kind of cardholder who carries a balance from month to month, you’ll want to consider how having a rewards card could potentially impact your budget and credit score.Your unique spending habits: To fully maximize your rewards, you’ll need to examine your current spending habits and nail down the categories where you spend the most money. Perhaps you spend a lot of money on travel or you dine out frequently. Selecting a card that rewards that spending through cash back or redeemable points within those specific categories can help you get the most out of your card. “In the current inflationary environment, it's more important than ever for consumers to be savvy spenders, and that can include using a card that will reward them while they spend—as long as they are managing their credit responsibly,” says Pal.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

(ARHS) and Tractor Supply (TSCO). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Arhaus, Inc. and Tractor Supply are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ARHS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ARHS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.85, while TSCO has a forward P/E of 21.21. We also note that ARHS has a PEG ratio of 0.92. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TSCO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.07.Another notable valuation metric for ARHS is its P/B ratio of 11.21. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSCO has a P/B of 12.56.These metrics, and several others, help ARHS earn a Value grade of B, while TSCO has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesARHS stands above TSCO thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that ARHS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock bears a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).During the thirdquarter of 2022, NuVasive’s revenue missed the consensus mark by 0.8%. The company’s performance continues to be challenged by inflationary costs, supply chain disruptions, volatility in foreign exchange rates and the persistent COVID-led impact.In the reported quarter, Selling, general and administrative expenses climbed 5.4% year over year to $154 million, whereas research and development (R&amp;D) expenses rose 1.1% year over year to $23.7 million. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by variable expenses on higher net sales, freight costs and continued R&amp;D investments to advance core spine and enabling technologies product portfolios.The company believes its 2022 guidance is appropriately conservative, considering macroeconomic pressures on net sales and operating profit experienced till the third-quarter earnings release. NUVA expects to experience similar levels of impact throughout the year.NuVasive, Inc. Price NuVasive, Inc. PriceNuVasive, Inc. price | NuVasive, Inc.

The orthopedic industry, in particular, is highly competitive with the presence of bellwethers like Zimmer Holdings, Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s DePuy. In terms of pricing, the company experiences declining prices for its products due to increasing competition in the spine market.On a positive note, NuVasive exited the third quarter of 2022 with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong sales performance across the U.S. Spinal Hardware and U.S. Surgical Support businesses instill optimism. Robust international performance is encouraging. The continued demand for the Simplified Cervical Disc and the Pulse platforms is also encouraging. The expansion of both margins is an upside.Story continuesNuVasive is undertaking efforts to advance its position in the $2.6-billion cervical sub-segment. The company’s C360 portfolio currently features the NuVasive ACP system with Advanced Material Science interbodies and the Simplified Cervical Disc.During the third quarter earnings call, the company mentioned the recent commercial launch of Reline Cervical.

(ARHS)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 35.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $13.06 in the previous session. Arhaus, Inc. has gained 32% since the start of the year compared to the -22% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the -8.5% return for the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 10, 2022, Arhaus, Inc. reported EPS of $0.27 versus consensus estimate of $0.15 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 9.19%.For the current fiscal year, Arhaus, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share on $1.23 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.08 per share on $1.36 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 1.36% and 10.69%, respectively.Valuation MetricsArhaus, Inc. may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Arhaus, Inc. has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 14.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 14.8X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 17.1X versus its peer group's average of 6.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.92. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Arhaus, Inc. currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Arhaus, Inc. fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Arhaus, Inc. shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does ARHS Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ARHS have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA). ULTA has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of A.Earnings were strong last quarter. Ulta Beauty Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 30.56%, and for the current fiscal year, ULTA is expected to post earnings of $24.17 per share on revenue of $9.98 billion.Shares of Ulta Beauty Inc. have gained 8.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 21.5X and a P/CF of 21.22X.The Retail - Miscellaneous industry is in the top 30% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ARHS and ULTA, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When asked if the hikes would take place in other markets, he said, ""Right now, we're not quite sure.""The decades-long promise of 99-cent cans was part of the decision to raise that price, he said.""We have this distinctive 99-cent can, and our goal is to hold that price. Sometimes you have to offset it with other things you do within the portfolio of a product,"" Vultaggio said.Taken by Janna Herron, Yahoo Finance Editor.A rise in the cost of plastic was another reason behind the increase. ""We've kind of wrung out all the opportunities from speeding up lines and changing bottles and doing the things that we can do behind the scenes, so that we don't have to affect price, but we ran out of options, so we were forced to make a move there,"" Vultaggio said.Other rising costs hit the family-owned company, too. ""Things like freight ... and sugar ... energy ... electric gas and and labor costs are out of our control.""'Until something drastic happens, we're gonna hold that price'Though the price of the 99-cent can will remain, the can itself recently became one ounce smaller.""The 23-ounce can is now 22 ounces.

WMT, and Procter &amp; Gamble PG – have seen their earnings outlooks shift positively over the last several months.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn top of improved earnings outlooks, all three reward their shareholders via dividends. Let’s take a closer look at each one.Walmart Inc. Walmart, a titan in the retail space with an extensive product catalog, operates through various retail channels, including brick-and-mortar and an e-commerce platform. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWMT’s annual dividend yield currently stands at 1.5%, a few ticks above its Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average. In addition, dividend growth is apparent; the company’s payout has grown by 2% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite a challenging business environment, WMT has recently posted strong quarterly results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back quarters.In its latest release, the retail titan reported earnings more than 13% above expectations and penciled in a 3.6% sales surprise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Coca-Cola CompanyThe Coca-Cola Company is an American multinational corporation best known for its flagship Coca-Cola beverage. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Impressively, KO is a Dividend King, showing an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 50+ consecutive years of increased dividend payouts.Story continuesThe company’s annual dividend presently sits at 2.9%, modestly above its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSimilar to WMT, Coca-Cola has consistently posted better-than-expected earnings, exceeding top and bottom line estimates in seven consecutive quarters.In its latest release, Coca-Cola raised its organic revenue forecast for its current fiscal year, now expecting growth of 14% - 15% (previously 12% - 13%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchProcter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble is a branded consumer products company that markets its products in more than 180 countries. Like the stocks above, PG’s earnings outlook has recently improved, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The consumer staples titan rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend, currently yielding 2.4% paired with a payout ratio sitting at 63% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, the company’s valuation multiples could steer away more value-conscious investors; currently, PG shares trade at a 25.7X forward earnings multiple, above the 23.9X five-year median and Zacks sector average.PG carries a Style Score of “D” for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineLow-beta stocks are less sensitive to the market’s movements, helping provide investors with a valuable level of stability and defense.And after a rough showing from the market in 2022, many are undoubtedly considering adding more defensive stocks to their portfolios.All three low-beta stocks above – The Coca-Cola Company KO, Walmart Inc. WMT, and Procter &amp; Gamble PG – could be considerations for those looking to heighten their portfolio’s defense.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank and reward their shareholders, undoubtedly a strong pairing.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the end of 2022, there was a chart making the rounds on Twitter that compared Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation performance over the last 5 years with Berkshire Hathaway’s.As you might have guessed, Berkshire Hathaway is outperforming thanks to ARKK’s terrible 2022. Over the last 5 years, Berkshire Hathaway is up 76.3% while ARKK is down 18.9%.Meanwhile, many investors are diving into Berkshire Hathaway’s stock in search of safety. Over the last three months, Berkshire’s B shares are up 19.3% versus the S&amp;P 500’s gain of 10.5%.But is Berkshire Hathaway itself even a value stock?Should value investors be investing in the stock, and its large holdings?Is there Value in Berkshire Hathaway? 1.       Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Berkshire Hathaway is a large cap holding company that owns dozens of businesses, cash and equity investments. Reminder: it’s not a mutual fund or an ETF fund. It’s a corporation with Warren Buffett as Chairman and CEO.Berkshire Hathaway trades with a forward P/E of 19, which is more expensive than the S&amp;P 500 and is not in the normal range for most value investors. Tracey usually looks for companies trading under 15.What about its PEG ratio? Berkshire Hathaway has a PEG of 2.7, which does not indicate value either. A PEG under 1.0 indicates a company has growth and value.Story continuesHowever, Berkshire does have a P/B ratio of 1.5, which is under 3.0, and indicates value.Is a low P/B ratio enough for value investors or should they wait for a sell-off in the Berkshire Hathaway shares?2.       Apple Corp. AAPLApple is Berkshire’s largest equity holding. It was cheap when Buffett first bought it in 2016, with a forward P/E of around 10.But in 2023, it is trading at 21x, which is much higher than the S&amp;P 500 which is trading around 18. Apple has a PEG of 1.7.Additionally, earnings are expected to rise just 1% in fiscal 2023 so there isn’t much growth there either.Should value investors take a pass on Apple?3.       Bank of America BACBank of America is Berkshire’s second largest holding, and has been for several years. Warren Buffett has been patient with Bank of America, even while selling many of his other bank stocks.Shares of Bank of America are down 30% in the last year. It’s cheap with a forward P/E of 9.5. But with banks, investors should also look at P/B ratio. Bank of America’s is 1.15. With banks, a P/B ratio near 1.0 indicates there’s value.Should investors join Buffett and add Bank of America to their own short list?4.       Chevron Corp. CVXChevron suddenly became the third largest position in Berkshire’s portfolio, at 8%, last year when Buffett went all in on the energy stocks.Chevron shares surged in 2022, rising 36.9% as energy was the best performing sector for the second year in a row. But it remains cheap as earnings have also risen. Chevron is trading with a forward P/E of just 10.8.It’s yielding 3.2% now.Should you follow Buffett into the energy trade, or is it too late to jump into Chevron?5.       The Coca-Cola Company KOCoca-Cola has been in the Berkshire portfolio since the first quarter of 2001. Berkshire has held it through the Great Recession and the pandemic. It’s still the fourth largest position in the portfolio.Coca-Cola shares are up 25% over the last 2 years, versus just 5.4% for the S&amp;P 500.But shares aren’t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 24.4. And Coca-Cola has a PEG ratio of 3.9.Is Coca-Cola too expensive for value investors in 2023?What Else Should You Know About Berkshire Hathaway to Start 2023?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns BAC in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

278,e6f90289-8a1d-3c18-8e93-cf3a89becaf0,WHR,2023-01-14,7 Oddball Stocks to Buy That Can Surprise Investors in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-oddball-stocks-buy-surprise-155817671.html,1673366297,STORY,"['WHR', 'LIND', 'PETWW', 'VVV', 'HRB', 'CRH']","[If you follow the advice of legendary investor Warren Buffett literally and religiously, you might not appreciate this list of oddball stocks to buy. Chances are, at least one of these names features an area that does not meet your core area of competency. And that would be a no-no for Buffett, who essentially stated to invest only in what you know.However, I think even someone as astute and accomplished as the Oracle of Omaha will appreciate another attribute: flexibility. With many bizarre (and sometimes horrifying so) incidents occurring since the coronavirus pandemic, oddball stocks to buy have their place. By that, I’m referring to publicly traded enterprises that don’t always capture mainstream attention. Maybe they’re boring or simply appear to lack relevance.Still, with so many transitions occurring in society, the key word here is variability. Right now, we’re facing a math question with very few constants provided. We’re going to need to be flexible, adaptable, and yes, creative. Below are the oddball stocks to buy that can surprise investors in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHRBH&amp;R Block$35.68WHRWhirlpool$151.50VVVValvoline$34.19CRHCRH.$43.34PETWag! Group$2.70PLNTPlanet Fitness$80.31LINDLindblad Expeditions$9.17H&amp;R Block (HRB)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comIf you’re like arguably most Americans, you hate doing your taxes. Generally speaking, I’m not a big fan of busy paperwork and so I never liked doing my taxes, even when I filed relatively simple W-2 tax forms. However, as an independent contractor filling out 1099 forms, taxes are much more complicated. And that’s why I peg tax advisory firm H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) as one of the oddball stocks to buy.Sure, taxes might not be the first place to look for market opportunities. However, in the trailing year, HRB gained over 60%. And while it’s down about 12% in the trailing month, I believe HRB is simply offering a temporary discount. Should H&amp;R Block rise higher from here, you can thank the burgeoning gig economy.Story continuesWith the pendulum of power swinging back to employers, many if not most companies will recall their workers. Naturally, some corporate employees will revolt, choosing to branch out on their own as freelancers. That’s all fine and well until they get to tax time. I’m almost certain that the complexities will drive these gig workers to H&amp;R Block, making it one of the oddball stocks to buy.Whirlpool (WHR)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockRecently, I’ve been discussing appliance manufacturer Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR), which will surely catch a lot of folks by surprise; that is if they don’t understand the context. Let’s face it, Whirlpool represents a boring entity among oddball stocks to buy. Nor has its performance provided much encouragement, shedding 32% of equity value in the trailing year.However, here’s the vital factor to keep in mind about WHR stock. Essentially, the underlying paradigm shifted back in early 2020. And because equipment breaks down over time (and quicker through additional usage), Whirlpool has a date with destiny.If that was cryptic, think of it this way. When employers sent their workers home during the initial onslaught of Covid-19, home appliances collectively incurred much greater usage. Therefore, if an appliance under normal conditions were to have failed in 2024 or 2025, the increased usage may push this failure date to sometime this year. Yes, it’s wild to talk so much about WHR as if it’s an innovator. It’s not. However, equipment always breaks down. And that’s why Whirlpool ranks among the oddball stocks to buy.Valvoline (VVV)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comOne of the companies that fade into the background, Valvoline (NYSE:VVV) is an American manufacturer and distributor of its namesake automotive oil, additives, and lubricants. Sure enough, during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis – and throughout most of the new normal – Valvoline may as well have been nonexistent. That’s because with white-collar workers no longer commuting to work, VVV suffered a relevancy crisis.Frankly, Valvoline’s annual revenue trek tells all you need to know. In 2019, the company posted $2.39 billion in top-line sales. In the next year, it posted only $727 million. I’m sorry but society must return to normal for these office-adjacent businesses to survive. Fortunately, as discussed above, the workplace may soon normalize. Personally, I believe it’s an inevitability.I don’t want to beat the topic to death. However, remote work caused problems, such as enhanced cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the gentrification of more rural areas. While worker bees might not be happy about it, workplace normalization translates to heavy commuting. And that’s going to be a lifesaver for Valvoline. Therefore, it’s one of the oddball stocks to buy.CRH (CRH)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAlthough not the most talked-about enterprise in the capital market, CRH (NYSE:CRH) may soon be a top player. Indeed, for the business week that ended Jan. 6, CRH gained over 10%. Moving forward, I easily see this company as one of the oddball stocks to buy.A building materials specialist, CRH covers everything from bridges to highways to communications and utilities. Fundamentally, then, the enterprise enjoys two major upside catalysts. First, the Biden administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) earmarks investments toward rebuilding and repairing the nation’s roads and bridges. Obviously, this plays into CRH’s hands, making it one of the oddball stocks to buy.On another related note, the transition to electric vehicles should increase wear and tear on our roadways. That’s because research from the Delft University of Technology discovered that the extra weight of EVs resulted in greater asphalt wear. Cynically, this dynamic should bolster CRH stock. To be fair, some experts state that heavier EVs won’t cause roads to crumble faster. Of course, you’re free to make up your mind, though if everyone transitioned to EVs, I struggle to understand how that won’t impact asphalt durability.Wag! Group (PET)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7An American pet care company, Wag! Group (NASDAQ:PET) offers a technology platform to connect pet owners with independent pet professionals for on-demand and scheduled services. These include dog walking, training, and other pet care services arranged through a mobile application. Essentially, Wag! Group represents the ride-sharing platform of the pet care market.Fundamentally, PET may represent one of the oddball stocks to buy because of two core tailwinds. First, as discussed above, the gig economy could expand the number of pet professionals. After possibly years of drudgery in the cubicles of Corporate America, some white-collar workers may need a change of pace. Working with dogs may be just the ticket.Second, America loves her pets. In 2021, the American Pet Products Association noted that the total pet and pet care industry rang up $123 billion in sales. That set a new benchmark. It also confirmed that in many cases, Americans probably love their furry friends more than their human ones. That’s a positive for PET stock. Of course, the drawback for Wag! Group centers on volatility. In the trailing year, it’s down nearly 73%. Still, recent upside momentum suggests that PET could rank among the oddball stocks to buy for speculators.Planet Fitness (PLNT)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBack during the initial impact of the Covid-19 crisis, physical fitness center Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT) suffered a catastrophic loss. Of course, at the time, government agencies began cracking down on non-essential activities. And even if gyms were open back then, arguably few wanted to mix it up with strangers. Therefore, 2020 revenue fell to $406.6 million, down from 2019’s tally of $688.8 million.Unsurprisingly, certain home-fitness equipment providers enjoyed banner years during the new normal. However, we probably stand on the cusp of normalization in the fitness ecosystem. Today, it’s the home-fitness specialists that find themselves struggling. On the other hand, PLNT is on a recovery trek, making it one of the oddball stocks to buy.In the third quarter of 2022, Planet’s revenue hit $244.4 million, up over 58% against the year-ago quarter. Much of this renewed enthusiasm focuses on the desire for socialization. During the pandemic, the Pew Research Center reported that 40% of U.S. adults faced “high levels of psychological distress.” Almost certainly, loneliness played a significant role. Now, Planet Fitness stands to benefit from Covid’s unique consequences.Lindblad Expeditions (LIND)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comWhen it comes to oddball stocks to buy, Lindblad Expeditions (NASDAQ:LIND) may well be the ringleader. While most people probably dream about standard vacations such as visiting Paris, Lindblad offers a much more distinct opportunity. From circumnavigating the Baltic Sea to sailing to the Galapagos Islands to shipping out to Antarctica, the company jumps to a whole new level.Of course, these exotic vacations don’t come cheap. On that basis alone, some folks might steer clear of LIND stock. Another negative factor that comes quickly to mind is Lindblad’s poor market performance. In the trailing year, shares gave up over 48% of equity value. Still, in the business week that ended Jan. 6, LIND skyrocketed over 20%. What’s up with that?Fundamentally, what could be going on is the manifestation of the wealth gap. With the biggest winners of the Covid-19 pandemic being the ultra-rich, this exclusive demographic is the only one that can afford such extravagance. And because the elite did so well during the last roughly three years, they might splurge on Lindblad’s services.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Strengthening air dimensions business is driving its Precision &amp; Science Technologies segment.The company has been strengthening and expanding its businesses through asset additions for a while.

283,ffe25952-1987-3d90-9d1d-7e10190180ab,UNH,2023-01-14,Is Weakness In UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-nyse-110102960.html,1673694062,STORY,['UNH'],"[With its stock down 7.2% over the past month, it is easy to disregard UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study UnitedHealth Group's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:24% = US$21b ÷ US$86b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.24 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 24% ROETo begin with, UnitedHealth Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, UnitedHealth Group was able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the last five years.Story continuesWe then compared UnitedHealth Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 16% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for UNH? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is UnitedHealth Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 30% (implying that the company retains 70% of its profits), it seems that UnitedHealth Group is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, UnitedHealth Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 27%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that UnitedHealth Group's future ROE will be 28% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with UnitedHealth Group's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

292,8eb658de-79a2-3a55-99b5-b7bc66523d44,PG,2023-01-14,Only Four Days Left To Cash In On Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-four-days-left-cash-122454775.html,1673699094,STORY,['PG'],"[The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Procter &amp; Gamble's shares before the 19th of January in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 15th of February.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.91 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.65 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Procter &amp; Gamble has a trailing yield of approximately 2.4% on its current stock price of $150.88. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Procter &amp; Gamble paid out 60% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 67% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that Procter &amp; Gamble's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Procter &amp; Gamble earnings per share are up 9.7% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Procter &amp; Gamble has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Procter &amp; Gamble has lifted its dividend by approximately 5.0% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayHas Procter &amp; Gamble got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. To summarise, Procter &amp; Gamble looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.So if you want to do more digging on Procter &amp; Gamble, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Procter &amp; Gamble that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

The company is expected to deliver sales and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, indicating a 5.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For fiscal second-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $20.57 billion, suggesting a 1.8% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.We expect the company’s fiscal second-quarter total revenues to decline 4.6% year over year to $20,065.3 million and the bottom line to dip 5.4% to $1.57 per share.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 1.3%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 1.05%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price and EPS Surprise Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price and EPS SurpriseProcter &amp; Gamble Company The price-eps-surprise | Procter &amp; Gamble Company The QuoteKey Factors to NoteProcter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing higher freight, and commodity and input material cost inflation, which have been affecting its performance. The company’s gross margin for the fiscal second quarter is likely to have been under pressure, driven by the continued impacts of commodity and input material cost inflation, higher freight costs, negative product mix and other impacts, and increased product and packaging investments. Currency movements are expected to have negatively impacted all-in sales growth and earnings per share in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, Procter &amp; Gamble predicted higher commodity and freight costs to persist throughout fiscal 2023. Our estimate indicates a 4.7% year-over-year decline in gross profit for the fiscal second quarter, with the gross margin contracting 30 bps. We estimate a 6.1% decline in operating income in the fiscal second quarter, with the operating margin contracting 50 bps. This is likely to translate into a bottom-line decline in the to-be-reported quarter.Currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have weighed on the fiscal second-quarter performance. Our estimate indicates a 6% impact from currency headwinds in the fiscal second quarter.However, Procter &amp; Gamble has been gaining from improved productivity and persistent demand for cleaning products. The company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the benefits of continued strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which have been aiding organic sales growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for organic sales growth is pegged at 4.9%.The company has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans, which have been aiding its margins. PG has been witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of its business, driven by the productivity program. Its continued business investments and efforts to offset macro cost headwinds, and balanced top and bottom-line growth underscore its productivity efforts. Gains from productivity savings and pricing are expected to have aided margins and the bottom line in the fiscal second quarter.Moreover, the company is likely to have witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Procter &amp; Gamble this time around.

297,e17fe445-b070-36ac-9053-196cdc62757c,VNO,2023-01-14,Should We Be Cautious About Vornado Realty Trust's (NYSE:VNO) ROE Of 2.4%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cautious-vornado-realty-trusts-nyse-123633764.html,1673699793,STORY,"['VNO', 'VNORP']","[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Vornado Realty Trust How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vornado Realty Trust is:2.4% = US$174m ÷ US$7.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.02 in profit.Does Vornado Realty Trust Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Vornado Realty Trust has a lower ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry classification.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.  Our risks dashboard should have the 3 risks we have identified for Vornado Realty Trust.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesVornado Realty Trust's Debt And Its 2.4% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Vornado Realty Trust, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.18. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Vornado Realty Trust may not be the best stock to buy.

300,35406173-8bd3-30a6-9f55-4c46fefad4ae,AAL,2023-01-14,"Airlines: The ‘setup is pretty good’ as travel sector continues to recover, analyst says",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/airlines-setup-pretty-good-travel-212734098.html,1673645254,VIDEO,"['DAL', 'AAL', 'LUV']","[Raymond James Managing Director Savi Syth joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss earnings for the major airlines and how the travel sector has rebounded since COVID.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]- There we go. Closing bell on Wall Street. Let's check out how we finished out this week. It's been largely a pretty solid week. We talked about the CPI data earlier in the week, bank earnings today, and then possibly really turned on the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment number inflation. Expectations pretty solid, best since April 2021 in terms of the one-year outlook by the consumer. And there's your finish. The DOW gaining 0.3%, 112 points. The S&amp;P is up 0.4% and the NASDAQ also rising 78 points on the day. Seana.- All right. Let's take a look at Delta, because earnings were out soaring above expectations in the fourth quarter. But the airline continuing to see headwinds after trimming its guidance. Also citing profitability concerns. Here to discuss we want to bring in Savi Syth, Raymond James managing director. And Savi, when you take a look at the reaction here, some bit of concern from the street about what we saw from Delta. Fourth quarter numbers, though, look pretty solid to me. What do you think?SAVI SYTH: I think the fourth quarter number is solid, and it definitely beat expectations. I think it was the first quarter. And if you look at it, the revenue in the top line commentary is really strong. So I think there's a little bit more of an optics issue here, where some in consens-- in the consensus figures had costs that had the pilot deal.Some headed partially for the quarter, and some headed for the full quarter. So I think the reaction here has a little bit more to do with optics than reality. Also, if you take look at their 2023 cost guide, it hasn't changed. But the quarterly progression was a little bit different than we were thinking. And so I think it's more optics than-- than a really kind of disappointing update here.Story continues- Really just a lot to do with that new pilot contract that has not been ratified by the union yet. Ed Bastian saying he's never seen a more constructive backdrop for the industry. What do you make of that statement by the CEO?SAVI SYTH: I think if you look at third quarter 2022 and/or the second half of 2022, the airlines have fully recovered the-- the fuel price increase, which has doubled versus 2019, even though you have several components of demand that haven't recovered. You don't have a lot of large corporates still coming back. Some of the long haul international demand still coming back.So these demand, the avenue is still recovering and showing good progression on recovery, I think, they feel like the setup is pretty good. Obviously, you know, what everybody is worrying about is, you know, what the macroeconomic front will bring with some of the layoffs that you're seeing and what the Fed is trying to do, which is slow things down. But as it stands today, I think everything is looking quite strong from an airline demand perspective.- Savi, so that's Delta's story. I know you also cover American Airlines. And we saw the stock pop earlier this week hiking their revenue and their profit outlook. The position that American is in, comparing that to what we've seen from Delta, how do they stack up?SAVI SYTH: I think all these airlines are seeing a pretty similar environment. What I would say from a [INAUDIBLE] American, Delta, United, they are all benefiting from the fact that you still have long haul international that is recovering. You just started to see Japan open up. And a lot of the Pacific markets are finally in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter are recovering nicely.And you heard Delta today talk about in South America that's deep South America that's starting to finally recover and show good momentum. So this is really good for these [INAUDIBLE] that have international exposure. So I think the American revenue beat in the fourth quarter was stronger. But generally, I think they're all seeing a very positive environment here from a demand perspective. Admittedly, with one to three months of visibility versus what investors are worried about.- Yeah. All of them facing a couple of headwinds, including deliveries, and supply chains, and pilot shortages. Do you expect those to clear in the year ahead?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. For the [INAUDIBLE] I think the big thing is a training bottleneck as it comes to pilots. You're trying to train-- you're hiring four times as many pilots as you hired in the past. And the training footprints have been slow to expand. And it sounds like we should, as we head into the summer, be fully caught up, at least at the large airlines here. So that should start to ease.You're right about the supply chain. I think that's going to take longer. If you listen to the various OEMs, it sounds like something that's going to continue into 2024. Paradoxically, I think that might be good for the industry, because it will hold back capacity, especially in an environment where you might see some demand softening.- Savi, let's talk about Southwest, because I know you cover the stock. Certainly has been a rough couple of weeks for the company as they're trying to win back the trust in, really, consumers who were delayed and maybe never got on those flights during the holiday week. Talk to us just about the brand image that you think-- that you think Southwest is facing right now and whether or not you've changed your outlook on the stock as a result.SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I mean, it-- it's not good. And brand is something all these airlines protect jealously. And so they've definitely taken a hit here. What we've seen historically, though, is that consumers tend to have short memories. I think it will be important that Southwest doesn't repeat this again this summer. But as long as they kind of get their act together and-- and make sure they address this going forward, I think we'll see that for the most part collectively we'll have shorter memories. And the brand will over the longer term not-- not be as impacted. But they do have to take steps to make sure that this doesn't happen again.- Yeah. Estimate an $825 million hit, half of that due to lost revenue in those 16,000 canceled flights. Given what we saw from American and Delta, expectations for United who will report next week?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I mean, I-- I think you're going to see similar commentary about strong revenue environment. Again, they have greater exposure to international, and-- and that's the area that's recovering. So we-- we expect a kind of pretty good setup here. You know, they-- Similar to American, they hadn't updated their fourth quarter guidance.And so there could be kind of a-- a potentially stronger environment there. You saw both Southwest and American having some re-bookings from maybe Southwest customers that help offset the damage from the storms of their-- their own kind of revenue loss from the storms. So you might get that similar offset. So it looks like a pretty decent setup. Again, the question for United American is when are they going to get their pilot deals? And when-- when is that going to get reflected [INAUDIBLE]- No question about that. Every pilot is empowered right now to renegotiate with their union. They hold all the cards. So those salaries, certainly going up. Savi Syth, Raymond James, good to see you. Thanks so much. Enjoy the weekend.]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. American Airlines (AAL) earns a Zacks Rank #2 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 26, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.63 a share.American Airlines' Earnings ESP sits at 5.86%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.63 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.60.AAL is one of just a large database of Transportation stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is JetBlue Airways (JBLU).Slated to report earnings on January 26, 2023, JetBlue Airways holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.20 a share 13 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JetBlue Airways is $0.17, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 19.12%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, AAL and JBLU could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The company aims to establish a structured reduction strategy and further assist consumers in achieving their reduction objectives.By disclosing the findings of the study, LMR Naturals is inviting its customers to contribute to global mitigation efforts.LMR Naturals collaborated with a consulting company that specializes in low-carbon strategy and climate change adaptation, Carbone 4, to complete a Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) study of LMR Naturals. The study went beyond the assessment of Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (which are direct and indirect emissions from purchased energy), and integrated Scope 3 emissions.Scope 3 activities account for 95 percent of LMR's carbon footprint. Therefore, the analysis provides a comprehensive perspective by combining Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions across the entire value chain.The team used a life-cycle approach to generate a matrix filled with data to evaluate the carbon footprint of ingredients. The analysis reveals the significant impacts of the initial transformation (typically distillation or solvent extraction) on the overall footprint and strategies for lowering it.LMR conducted a study for each of its chemicals because the carbon footprint of fragrance ingredients might vary by three orders of magnitude. Customers can determine the carbon footprint of a perfume or aroma formula with data on an ingredient basis due to the accuracy of the method. This data permits customers to assess the impacts of LMR Naturals by IFF product in its formula.International Flavors is well-poised to benefit from the increasing demand for various consumer products containing flavors and fragrances. In the third quarter of 2022, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.36 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. The bottom line declined 7% from the year-ago quarter. IFF’s total revenues were $3,063 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,026 million. The top line was flat year over year.Story continuesInternational Flavors expects fiscal 2022 sales between $12.4 billion and $12.5 billion, lower than the earlier stated $12.6-$13 billion.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this food and beverage company have returned -2.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has lost 2.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of +7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.27 indicates a change of +7.5% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate of $26.79 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.1%. The $85.18 billion and $87.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.2% and +3.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $21.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.8%. EPS of $1.97 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.24%. The EPS surprise was +6.49%.Over the last four quarters, PepsiCo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo.

In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That includes a reassessment of risk tolerance. Many people are moving to more conservative holdings, understandably shaken by the magnitude and velocity of declines in growth securities in 2022.This has created some unintended consequences to be aware of. Many safe haven companies in sectors such as consumer staples and utilities have run up significantly. The rush into safe dividend stocks has made valuations much less appealing in various sectors.However, there are still plenty of good values in the dividend stock-paying arena. Investors just need to be a little more picky to make sure they are picking up dividend stocks that are still selling at an attractive price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo be eligible for this list, a company needs to pay a decent starting dividend yield, 2.0% or more. And, it has to be undervalued. I’ll use Morningstar’s fair value price estimate as the benchmark there, with a dividend stock needing to trade at a meaningful discount to that Morningstar estimate to make this list. With the ground rules set, here are seven leading dividend-paying stocks trading at a discount today.TickerCompanyPriceVZVerizon Communications$41.70CSCOCisco Systems$48.88VFCV.F. Corp$29.81PKPark Hotels &amp; Resorts$11.88AVBAvalonBay Communities$162.85BKBank of New York Mellon$48.12EMNEastman Chemical$88.86Verizon Communications (VZ)Verizon (VZ) logo on the side of a gray building.Source: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is one of America’s three large telecom operators. It is the most appealing dividend stock of the three. That’s because AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) slashed its dividend not that long ago, while T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) pays no dividend at all. Verizon, by contrast, has continued offering its usual generous dividend without interruption.Verizon is an attractive dividend stock for several reasons. One, its industry is stable and recession resistant. People keeping paying their phone bills even in a recession after all.Story continuesThere are also massive barriers to entry. Verizon and its competitors spend tens of billions of dollars to maintain and modernize their telecom infrastructure. Lately, Verizon shares have underperformed due to this spending. 5G rollout hasn’t delivered the expected level of returns as quickly as anticipated.However, Verizon’s large investments over the past few years will eventually bear fruit. Meanwhile, shares trade for just 8x forward earnings and offer a 6.2% dividend yield. Morningstar currently assigns a $59 price target for VZ stock, which offers tremendous upside from today’s $42 share price.Cisco Systems (CSCO)A Cisco (CSCO) sign outside of a building.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the king of internet networking equipment. It was formerly a hot stock, with Cisco being one of the leading performers in the late 1990s internet boom.Nowadays, Cisco is more of a stable growth and income sort of company. It has evolved from a hypergrowth firm to a dividend stock. But don’t mistake that for a lack of investment appeal.Indeed, Cisco still generates more than $50 billion per year in revenues. And after a period of decline, Cisco is now growing revenues again. Its efforts to broaden its product offerings and earn more subscription revenues are starting to pay off.CSCO stock has traded down more than 20% over the past year. That’s not too surprising given the plunge in the tech sector more generally. However, with that decline, Cisco now goes for less than 14 times forward earnings and offers a 3.1% dividend yield.V.F. Corp (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comV.F. Corp (NYSE:VFC) is a leading multi-brand apparel company. Historically, the company’s strength is that it takes a conglomerate approach to the industry. It owns more than a dozen brands and is frequently buying and selling labels to maximize value for the firm.This provides the company with internal diversification. When one brand is struggling, another one is usually doing well. For example, in 2022, The North Face performed well while Vans was stuck in a sales slump.Investors have dumped VFC stock over the past 18 months or so, with shares now down 70% from their all-time highs. This seems like a dramatic overcorrection given VF Corp remains solidly profitable despite current supply chain and inflation headwinds.VF has proven it can deal with adversity. It has increased its dividend for an amazing 50 years in a row despite a variety of economic downturns along the way. VFC stock is now a high-yielding option at a 6.9% dividend today.Park Hotels &amp; Resorts (PK)a Park Hotels &amp; Resorts (PK) branded destinationSource: ShutterstockPark Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE:PK) is a real estate investment trust dedicated to the lodging sector. It operates 47 premium branded hotels and resorts that contain 30,000 rooms in total. Importantly, 88% of these rooms are in the luxury or upscale categories, which means Park can charge premium prices for its stays.Park is an intriguing asset as it has been in transition. It was spun out of a larger company in 2017. It subsequently made a large acquisition in 2019, and has sold off various assets since then to refocus its portfolio on premium domestic hotels.Park was supposed to begin to show the merit of this approach in 2020 and 2021. However, the pandemic hit, and demand for hotel rooms plummeted. Now, however, the travel industry has started to surge once again, with high-end travel faring particularly well. This should bode well for Park Hotels and Resorts.Morningstar’s analyst Kevin Brown assigns PK stock a price target of $28 per share. That’s tremendous upside from today’s $12 share price. Brown arrives that price target with a fairly conservative assumption of a 12 times forward funds from operations ratio for Park’s shares.AvalonBay Communities (AVB)AVB stock: an Avalon sign in a garden next to a roadSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.comAvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB) formed in 1998 with the merger of Avalon Properties and Bay Apartment Communities. In the ensuing 25 years, AvalonBay has become one of America’s largest landlords.Currently, the company directly or indirectly owns nearly 300 different apartment communities. These, in turn, contain 88,405 different apartments. This gives AvalonBay a considerable amount of scale in terms of maintaining properties, finding tenants and expanding into additional markets.Apartments are currently an attractive investment field. Rents have soared over the past few years as people have upgraded their living conditions. The surge in housing prices and rising interest rates, meanwhile, have made home ownership a more expensive prospect for many households. That causes folks to rent apartments from the likes of AvalonBay instead of buying their own single-family home.AvalonBay shares have fallen a shocking 35% over the past year. This is primarily due to fears around rising interest rates and a slowdown in the housing market. However, thanks to favorable demographics, demand for apartments should remain strong despite near-term jitters. AVB stock currently yields 3.9%.Bank of New York Mellon (BK)BK stock: Bank of New York Mellon logo on the side of a buildingSource: Chrispictures/Shutterstock.comBank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), more commonly called BNY Mellon, is one of the world’s largest custodian banks. It, along with just a couple of other American firms, hold a dominant position in this category.Custodian banks are attractive since they take minimal credit risk. Rather than relying on higher-risk loans for income, they earn a large portion of their revenues from charging fees for managing and safeguarding assets for governments, hedge funds, high net worth individuals and other such clients.As you might expect, returns on custodian banking tend to be lower, since it is a low-risk business. However, the sector is one of the leading beneficiaries of higher interest rates. Custodian banks get to earn more interest on certain types of funds, and also are enjoying things such as reduced fee waivers on some fixed income products. This should lead to rising profits for BNY Mellon as interest rates settle at much higher levels than we’ve previously seen.BK stock rallied to new highs in 2021. However, shares fell more than 23% last year, putting BNY Mellon back in the value bucket. Shares currently go for less than 10 times forward earnings and offer a 2.9% dividend yield.Eastman Chemical (EMN)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comEastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) is a specialty chemicals company. The firm came about as a spinoff from the film and photography leader Eastman Kodak. Over the years, Kodak has largely faded into irrelevancy, however, the Eastman Chemical business has remained a winner.Eastman Chemical has carved out a lane for itself by focusing on proprietary products where it has a technological edge and can charge higher prices compared to commodity chemicals.On top of that, American chemical suppliers have a big advantage in 2023. That’s due to how the industry works. Chemical companies rely on petroleum and natural gas as base ingredients for many of their products. Furthermore, chemical plants are energy-intensive and have high fuel expenses. American operators have a massive edge over European and Japanese rivals now that fuel prices have soared overseas, but natural gas remains cheap in the American heartland.Eastman Chemical is currently delivering tremendous profits thanks to advantageous conditions in the U.S. along with strong industrial demand. Regardless, EMN stock is down more than 25% over the past year as investors fret about a potential recession. This has put the stock at just 11 times forward earnings while offering a 3.6% dividend yield. Morningstar sees fair value way up at $130 per share versus today’s price of $89.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in VZ, EMN, VFC stock.
