This compares to earnings of $1.47 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 22.22%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurance data provider would post earnings of $1.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Verisk , which belongs to the Zacks Business - Information Services industry, posted revenues of $630.4 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.36%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $766 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Verisk shares have lost about 2.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.7%.What's Next for Verisk?While Verisk has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Verisk: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.23 on $624.78 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.58 on $2.58 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Business - Information Services is currently in the bottom 17% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Advantage Solutions Inc. (ADV), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on March 1.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -40%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Advantage Solutions Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $1.07 billion, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The increase in income from continuing operations is primarily due to an impairment loss incurred in 2021 related to the disposition of our Financial Services segment, offset by a reversal of a litigation reserve.Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations (diluted EPS) were $1.37 for the fourth quarter of 2022, up 87.7%.

The increase was primarily related to a non-cash impairment charge of $134.0 million associated with our Financial Services reporting unit in 2021 and the release of the previously established $50.0 million litigation reserve during the fourth quarter of 2021.

This includes, but is not limited to, our expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our common stock in the future, subject to the determination by our Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation determinations, and other factors, risks, and uncertainties.

You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.Other factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this release reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses: EBITDA represents GAAP net income from continuing operations adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense; and (iv) provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparison.Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income from continuing operations adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items.Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.Organic: Organic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale) that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP). Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent dispositions, for which results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.Organic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar; accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.See page 10 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and a segment results summary and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA. See page 11 for a reconciliation of segment adjusted EBITDA margin, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses, and a reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS. See page 12 for a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.Attached Financial StatementsPlease refer to the full Form 10-K filing for the complete financial statements and related notes.VERISK ANALYTICS, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021  2022  2021   (in millions, except for share and per share data) ASSETS: Current assets:        Cash and cash equivalents $112.5  $111.9 Accounts receivable, net  290.1   299.9 Prepaid expenses  83.7   87.8 Income taxes receivable  44.2   41.4 Other current assets  32.0   31.4 Current assets held-for-sale  362.6   335.0 Total current assets  925.1   907.4 Noncurrent assets:        Fixed assets, net  541.5   531.4 Operating lease right-of-use assets, net  182.0   224.0 Intangible assets, net  504.8   482.3 Goodwill  1,676.0   2,047.6 Deferred income tax assets  31.7   1.8 Other noncurrent assets  371.4   409.4 Noncurrent assets held for sale  2,728.6   3204.2 Total assets $6,961.1  $7,808.1          LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Current liabilities:        Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $292.8  $262.1 Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt  1,392.9   971.3 Deferred revenues  321.7   347.8 Operating lease liabilities  29.5   31.7 Income taxes payable  -   3.0 Current liabilities held-for-sale  282.3   232.10 Total current liabilities  2,319.2   1,848.0 Noncurrent liabilities:        Long-term debt  2,343.2   2,342.8 Deferred income tax liabilities  145.6   290.3 Operating lease liabilities  189.9   231.3 Other noncurrent liabilities  17.9   43.3 Noncurrent liabilities held-for-sale  177.6   209.90 Total liabilities  5,193.4   4,965.6 Commitments and contingencies        Stockholders’ equity:        Common stock, $.001 par value;

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Range Resources (NYSE:RRC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Range Resources Range Resources' Improving ProfitsStrong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that Range Resources' EPS went from US$1.65 to US$4.95 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Range Resources shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 18% to 41%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Range Resources' future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Range Resources Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$6.4b company like Range Resources. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Holding US$71m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Is Range Resources Worth Keeping An Eye On?Range Resources' earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Range Resources very closely.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's Year-End Earnings Call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Degner, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Scucchi, Chief Financial Officer. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation, that we've posted on our website. We may reference certain of those slides on the call this morning.

With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.Story continuesJeffrey L. VenturaThanks, Laith, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this morning's call. While front month natural gas prices have no doubt wavered over the past couple of months, Range's operations have remained consistent. We've made steady progress on key objectives, and our business is more resilient today than at any point in the company's history. In 2022, Range successfully managed a great opportunity the natural gas markets presented us with. We delivered our operational plans safely and with peer-leading efficiencies. We generated record free cash flow, materially strengthened our financial position and returned significant capital to shareholders. At the end of the year, we had reduced debt by over $1 billion, marking our fifth consecutive year of debt reduction, repurchased $400 million in shares and established an annualized dividend of $0.32 per share. We captured much of the upside presented to us in 2022, with a deliberate fit-for-purpose hedging program. Ultimately, every natural gas E&amp;P company would have preferred to have been unhedged last year, as the natural gas market moved higher. But when looking back at our results, Range's hedge program retained more of the upside on a per Mcf basis, than any of our natural gas peers. Looking forward into 2023 and 2024, the natural gas market is in a different place, but our hedge program is once again positioned for success. Our hedging activity is not aimed at picking tops and bottoms, but our program is aimed at supporting durable free cash flow through the cycles, while retaining exposure to improving longer-term natural gas and NGL fundamentals. Looking at our 2022 results and projections for the next 2 years, I believe we have struck that balance quite well. Our business generates free cash flow down to very low prices, and for 2023, we believe Range has among the best annual breakevens in the industry, well below $2 per Mcf. The resilience that our business has in a lower price environment, like we find ourselves in today is a positive differentiator for Range. Having hedges in place to cover our fixed cost and capital commitments is part of it, but the business model over the long run is really underpinned by Range's sustaining capital requirements. Our relatively low capital requirements are the result of Range's class-leading drilling and completion costs, coupled with our shallow base decline in large blocky core inventory. Altogether, these result in a peer-leading all-in maintenance that is approximately $0.76 per Mcfe. This provides Range a solid foundation for consistently generating significant free cash flow and returns to shareholders. Further bolstering, Range's durability is our liquids production. NGLs and Condensate are approximately 30% of Range's production. Through the cycles, our liquids revenue has provided an uplift to natural gas prices. And using today's strip pricing for 2023, that uplift is meaningful. For context, Range's NGL pricing would currently be priced around $26 per barrel, using strip prices for 2023. That is the equivalent to a 40% or $1.30 per Mcf premium to current Henry Hub strip pricing for 2023. When we roll all of that together: our low maintenance capital, our leading hedge program and our liquids optionality, you get the lowest breakeven amongst natural gas producers and the most durable free cash flow in 2023. As we show in our slides, Range is still generating several hundred million dollars in free cash flow at $2.50 natural gas prices. Importantly, our leading efficiencies and low breakevens are sustainable because of Range's large blocky acreage position that provides us decades of core inventory. A portion of the value of this massive inventory can be found in our year-end reserves. The after-tax PV-10 of our reserves using $4 NYMEX, which is approximately where the 10-year strip is, equates to over $40 per share, net of debt, over 50% higher than Range's current share price. For added context, our reserve report includes our proved developed wells and only 367 undeveloped locations out of approximately 3,000 undrilled core locations, we have in the Marcellus. Simply put, we do not believe the significant resource value is currently reflected in today's market, presenting Range the opportunity to create meaningful long-term per share value for equity holders through our buyback program, which has $1.1 billion of availability remaining. As a reminder, we set a target in the spring of 2021 to reduce debt by more than $2 billion by the end of 2023. Today, we are 90% of the way towards that target. It's been a successful repositioning of our balance sheet within a short period of time and clears the path for meaningful returns of capital to shareholders in the years ahead. Before turning it over to Mark and Dennis, I'll reiterate what I've said on the last many calls. Range is in the best position in the company's history. As the world continues to move towards cleaner, more efficient fuels, natural gas and NGLs will be the affordable, reliable and abundant supply that help power our everyday lives, while also helping billions of others improve their standard of living. We believe Appalachian natural gas and natural gas liquids are positioned to meet that future demand. And within Appalachia, Range will be among those leading the way on capital efficiency, emissions intensity and transparency, which are all core to generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders. Range has derisked a massive inventory of high-quality wells in the Marcellus, measured in decades, and translated that into a business capable of generating free cash flow through the cycles. With the resilient business plan for 2023 and '24, and favorable long-term fundamentals for natural gas and natural gas liquids, Range is well positioned to generate healthy returns on and returns of capital to shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Dennis to cover operations.Dennis L. DegnerThanks, Jeff. I'll start with capital. All-in CapEx for the year totaled $492 million. Included in our fourth quarter activity were 9 additional top holes as we were able to secure drilling equipment in December in advance of our 2023 program. This added $11 million to our original capital plans.Production for the fourth quarter averaged 2.2 Bcf equivalent per day, resulting in an annual average daily production just above 2.12 Bcf equivalent per day for the year. This was achieved despite a cumulative production loss of 2.7 Bcf equivalent, and a few well turn-in lines being moved into January during the cold weather, Appalachia experienced in late December. As we look forward into 2023, our all-in capital spending is expected to be between $570 million and $615 million, with this year's activity weighted more towards our liquids-rich acreage versus last year. Approximately 2/3 of the lateral footage turn to sales this year will be in the wet and super-rich acreage positions with the remainder in Range's dry gas footprint, including 3 wells in Northeast PA. This plan delivers a similar production level as last year, at 2.12 to 2.16 Bcf equivalent per day, while adding lateral footage to our expected inventory at year-end. The incremental inventory being added is underpinned by the drilling team's successes in late 2022. And so far in 2023, they are off to an incredible start, setting daily footage records, that I will touch on in just a moment. As a result, our 2023 capital plan includes approximately $30 million associated with this lateral inventory, providing us with increased optionality as we think about our 2024 and 2025 operational plans. Approximately 95% of this year's capital is slated to be allocated towards drilling and completions-related activity, with the remaining balance directed towards leasing and support functions. Similar to prior years, the 2023 program is front-end loaded with 3 horizontal rigs tapering off by year-end, while completions will continuously utilize a single electric frac crew, with a second crew performing planned spot work. 68 horizontal wells are expected to be drilled with 61 wells turning to sales during the year. Our average horizontal lengths for wells completed and turned to sales during the year will be approximately 11,000 feet per well, with more than half of the wells developed on pads with existing production, similar to prior years. Our production is expected to be back-half weighted in 2023, similar to last year, which fits nicely with the current shape of the natural gas forward curve. A review of our 2022 operational highlights begins with drilling. In the fourth quarter, we drilled 13 top holes and 5 horizontals with an average drilled horizontal length for the quarter of approximately 14,700 feet. As part of these results, we also added 4 new wells to our top 15 long lateral list, with each of the 4 laterals drilled in excess of 18,300 feet. This success continued into 2023, where the team has set a new range record by drilling in excess of 7,300 feet in a single day. And then beat that record again at 7,900 feet in a single day and the days that followed. These results so far this year, represent a 20% increase versus the prior record, showing the team's continued efforts to improve efficiencies after drilling over 1,200 wells. Continuing with the flexibility afforded by our large, contiguous acreage position and the practice of returning to existing pads, 75% of top holes drilled in the fourth quarter were on pads with existing production. In addition to the efficiency gains by returning to pads, 90% of the wells drilled in Southwest PA in 2022 were drilled with dual fuel rigs, which successfully displaced more than 480,000 gallons of diesel fuel. The fuel savings equated to nearly $2 million while improving emissions from our operations. As a result of our fourth quarter long lateral development, drilling costs were approximately $230 per lateral foot, which was a 15% improvement versus the prior quarter. On the completion side, we reached 8.8 frac stages per day in the fourth quarter and completed over 3,100 total fracs for the year. Looking back on 2022, completion efficiencies continued to improve while setting several new records. The first new record involved averaging 9 frac stages per day for a given quarter. Second, a new benchmark of 15 frac stages completed in a 24-hour period. And third, averaging 8.2 frac stages per day for the full year. One area driving these efficiency improvements is our return trips to existing pads and the data-driven decisions enhancing each consecutive completion job. For example, operations returning to pads has seen the average frac stages per day increase by 33%, versus the first wave of development. Applying data from prior completions, coupled with our use of strategic logistical planning and utilizing existing surface equipment, has supported our recent records and continued leadership amongst peers on well cost and overall capital efficiency. Water recycling efforts for Range's water operations and logistics teams resulted in saving $2.8 million for the fourth quarter with our full year savings reaching a total of $12.9 million. Looking back on the past 3 years, the average savings per year is $12.4 million. And looking back even farther to 2018, the 5-year average is $11.8 million in savings per year. Once again demonstrating the repeatable components that underpin Range's operations. In addition to our standard production procedures, new technology is playing a role in our base production management. This past year, Range pilot tested the use of artificial intelligence in our production operations. Working in conjunction with our AI technology provider, an algorithm was created to monitor well production, and make automated changes to perimeters within our flow logic that enhance production and reduce downtime. The trial was completed last year, and based upon the results, the project will be expanded this year, with the potential to add approximately 1 Bcf of gross production for the year. This production addition may appear small versus our total production, but it is this type of project that demonstrates our team's continued focus on production optimization and the use of technology to further support our low base decline and improved returns. In addition to our operational highlights, Range saw similar advancements for our safety performance in 2022 through collaborative efforts with our range employees and contractors, a 50% reduction in our OSHA incident rate was achieved versus last year. While reaching a program record low for days away or restricted duty and making it our best safety performance in our program history. Shifting over to marketing. Range's pre-hedge NGL price for Q4 was $27.17 per barrel, which was approximately $0.75 per barrel below the Mont Belvieu equivalent, showing the differential improvement mentioned on our prior earnings call. In November, Shell Chemical announced that operations had begun at its Pennsylvania project. The facility includes an ethylene steam cracker that will consume an estimated 100,000 barrels per day of ethane, when it ramps to full production. Representing a significant increase to in-basin ethane demand. As we've stated previously, Range's NGL logistics and marketing program is designed to provide flexibility across seasons, markets and phases of the business cycle. I'm pleased to report that the Range team made uninterrupted deliveries to our customers with improved NGL pricing versus the prior quarter. Looking ahead, Range is poised to benefit from improving NGL export economics in the first half of 2023 as China's reopening proceeds, ocean freight rates stabilize, and exports via the Marcus Hook terminal continue to command a price premium versus the Mont Belvieu index. Looking at this year, Range's NGL differential guide for 2023 is between $1 below and $1 premium relative to a Mont Belvieu equivalent barrel. For natural gas, Range reported a better-than-expected differential of $0.29 below NYMEX for full year 2022, which beat the low end of our guidance. As seen in our fourth quarter numbers, and over the past several years, Range's natural gas marketing process and active basis hedging program helped to mitigate some of the swings experienced in the daily markets. Similar to our guidance at the start of last year, Range is setting 2023 natural gas differential guidance at $0.35 to $0.45 below NYMEX. As we wrap up our operations and marketing update, I'd like to congratulate our team for their accomplishments discussed today. And their dedication to our continued improvements. Thanks for your hard work and commitment to delivering on our safe, efficient operations. We look forward to the exciting things we'll achieve in the year ahead. I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials.Mark S. ScucchiThanks, Dennis. On the earnings call a year ago, we spoke of a transformational year. We defined target debt levels and discussed the priority of debt reduction alongside our return of capital program. So in 2022, how did the actions and results compare to our stated objectives? I believe the results speak for themselves, that we met or exceeded stated objectives. It was a record year for Range Resources in nearly every respect. Safe, efficient operations led to planned production levels. Our on-plan production levels sold through a diverse portfolio of sales point, yielded strong realized prices. A constant focus on costs helped translate strong pricing into record cash flow and net income. That cash flow was strategically deployed to reduce debt, repurchase common stock and to reinitiate a cash dividend. In summary, we executed on the plan communicated a year ago, exceeded goals and enhanced the resilience of the company, so the business can thrive throughout commodity price cycles, generating strong returns and free cash flow. Let's start with a discussion of the balance sheet. During 2022, Range reduced debt by approximately $1.1 billion. This brings total debt reduction since 2018 to approximately $2.3 billion. Debt reduction, combined with the timely refinancing in January of last year, reduces current annualized interest expense by approximately $35 million, with additional savings expected, as debt is further reduced. Leverage, debt-to-EBITDAX, stood at 0.8x at year-end, the lowest in company history. Equity holders gain value from debt reduction, as well as through return of capital programs, including our share repurchases and cash dividends. In 2022, Range repurchased $400 million in common equity. Since initiating the share repurchase program, Range has repurchased $430 million in stock, reducing share count by 24 million shares or nearly 10%. Additionally, a sustainable dividend was reinitiated midyear, at an annualized rate of $0.32 per share, returning an additional $39 million to shareholders during the second half of the year. In total, capital returned to stakeholders in 2022 alone was more than $1.5 billion, equating to roughly 1/4 of current market cap. With $1.1 billion remaining under the existing share repurchase program, we have ample capacity to prudently reinvest free cash flow in shares of the business. As a reminder, our priority remains further improving the balance sheet to within our stated target range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion net debt, which we have the potential to reach in coming months based on recent strip pricing. As debt declines, we have incremental latitude to deploy free cash flow, as evidenced by our actions in 2022. Driving balance sheet improvement and shareholder returns was the tireless operating team focused on safety and efficiency. The team delivered planned production at a competitive all-in capital cost of $0.64 per unit of production. When measuring capital efficiency and a maintenance profile, dividing capital expenditures by total production offers good perspective on relative performance, both in terms of cost and production profile. Not all capital dollars invested are equal. With perhaps the lowest decline rate of comparable companies, Range's capital efficiency stands out in terms of cost per Mcfe, as well as the required reinvestment rate of cash flow to maintain production. At $0.64 per Mcfe or less than 30% of cash flow reinvested is maintenance capital in 2022, Range was at or near best in the industry. We expect the same to be true in 2023. Fourth quarter operating results achieved cash flow of $513 million compared to $112 million in capital spending resulting in free cash flow of approximately $400 million. Significant improvements in fourth quarter free cash flow were driven by a combination of lower expenses, and a 5% improvement in hedged realized prices per unit of production versus the prior year period, with realized price per unit reaching $4.33 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter cash margins per unit of production were $2.49, an increase of $0.39 or 18% compared to fourth quarter last year. Lease operating expenses remain in the historic range and in line with guidance at $0.11 per unit. Recurring cash G&amp;A expense was approximately $32 million or $0.15 per unit, roughly in line with preceding quarters despite inflation. Cash interest expense declined to less than $36 million. With the redemption of 2023 notes in December totaling $528 million, combined with debt reduction and refinancing earlier in 2022, annualized net interest expense run rate is estimated at $35 million lower than last year. Further significant interest savings should follow as we retire additional debt. As we discuss each quarter, Range's gas processing cost is linked to NGL prices, such that gathering, processing and transportation expense decreased during the fourth quarter, serving as a right-way risk relationship between costs and pricing. Also reducing costs in Q4 were lower fuel and electricity costs and some cost savings from winter weather downtime. Additionally, rising commodity prices have improved the value of our contingent derivative assets, such that the 2022 installment was maximized at $24.5 million, leaving an additional $21 million, as a potential remaining balance for 2023. Taxes have become a relevant topic with company profitability. In 2022, Range's total cash taxes or at state level were total roughly $15 million for the year. At year-end 2022, Range had federal NOL carryforwards totaling $2 billion. These NOLs will serve to reduce taxable income in coming years, subject to utilization limitations. For some added understanding, the first layer of federal NOLs totaling $375 million can be used to reduce up to 100% of taxable income. The remaining $1.7 billion of federal NOLs can be used to reduce up to 80% of a given year's taxable income. At current strip pricing and Range's expected profitability, we believe we will benefit from the full utilization of these NOL carryforwards in coming years. Turning from 2022 accomplishments to where the company is headed in 2023. Given the strong foundation provided by high-quality assets, paired with low financial leverage, we expect Range's strategic focus will remain consistent going forward: generate free cash flow, reduce debt, prudently return capital and reinvest in the business. This plan is reinforced with a thoughtfully constructed hedge book with that in principle is the same risk management process we have always used. We seek to thoughtfully retain participation and improved long-term market pricing while increasing confidence in near-term forecasted cash flow, all in support of a consistent and efficient operations, preserving the balance sheet and thereby preserving optionality around returns of capital. We believe Range's results demonstrate a thoughtful approach to hedging has served the company well and will continue to do so in the future. Presently, Range has approximately 55% of 2023 natural gas hedged with an average floor price of $3.57. And in 2024, approximately 35% hedged with an average floor price of $3.75, which is at or near the head of the class among natural gas producers. Range's business plan continues to be executed on what we believe is the largest high-quality asset in Appalachia, paired with a transport and sales portfolio delivering production across the U.S. and internationally, all underpinned by a strong financial foundation. We have the team, assets and balance sheet to succeed through price cycles, and we believe the Range business can and will continue to deliver significant value to investors. Jeff, back to you.Jeffrey L. VenturaOperator, we'll be happy to answer questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Jacob Roberts of TPH &amp; Company.Jacob Phillip RobertsJust looking at the Q4 results, I noticed the liquids percent is a tiny bit higher than the 30%, and it scaled throughout the year. And then comparing that to the turn-in line plan, you've laid out for 2023. I'm just curious if you could provide some guardrails around that 30% either through the year or as we might see it progress over the quarters?Dennis L. DegnerJacob, this is Dennis. When you look at a given quarter's results, there's some things that could move that percentage factor around, as we kind of take a step back and put some color around it. And one could be variations in ethane extraction, just given what's taking place at the market at that particular time. Timing of vessel loadings, that's something we've also clearly referenced, as a variable that can move some of our percentages around. But when you look at 2023 versus 2022 or even Q4, half of our activity in our turn-in lines is going to be clearly in the wet portion of our field. And when you look at it from wet through super-rich, you're going to see really variations just even between those 2 areas from amount of NGLs and also overall liquids production that will be generated from that activity. As you start to look through the balance of the year though, that production profile, as we touched on, in the prepared remarks, will be more back-half weighted. So we'll see some fluctuations throughout the given quarters as we move from dry, wet through the super rich profile of our activity program.Jacob Phillip RobertsGreat. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, and I echo the commentary about the great work your marketing team does, results as well as the disclosures you guys give. I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about longer term, how you guys are approaching the market, 2025-plus, as new opportunities might present themselves and any conversations that are happening now, that we might think about longer term?Dennis L. DegnerYes. This is Dennis again, Jacob. I'll dive in on this one. As we start to think about 2025 and beyond, clearly, the topic that starts to service is really the LNG second wave expansion that will start to come into service and beyond, and potential additional infrastructure. When you look at the way our program is shaped today, a couple of things we think about. One, our organization has, what we would say is from a marketing team perspective, experience in not only transacting conventional indices and markets here, the Lower 48, but also is we've also got exposure to international indices as we currently sit with our liquids exposure, and we like that -- the way that has diversified our program. Our transport, as we've touched on before, we get -- essentially 25% of our gas gets to the Gulf. The other 25% of that 50% that gets there is already transacting in the LNG space today. And we would continue to look at participating in that space further, as we go forward, but it also has to compete on a returns basis, as Mark's touched on with our financial objectives. So those are 2 key items. As we think about what the program will look like in the future, we want to continue to have conversations with varying -- we'll just say, we're going to have -- continue to have diversity as a part of our transportation portfolio and our customers that we transact with, whether it's on the NGL side or it will be on the Nat Gas side as well. And we think, when you look at -- this all ties back to our inventory conversation. We know that the expansion of infrastructure in the future, these are multi-decade financial investment decisions for our organizations. And we think that our inventory and our transport aligns really well with the ability to participate in this infrastructure and opportunities as they further materialize.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Umang Choudhary of Goldman Sachs.Umang ChoudharyI wanted to get your -- I wanted to get your updated thoughts on the natural gas and the NGLs macro as we see today. And then, I also had a follow-up on your thoughts around free cash flow allocation towards debt reduction and share repurchase, given you have line of sight towards the $1.5 billion number. So what are your thoughts around both those topics?Dennis L. DegnerUmang, I'll start with the natural gas and NGL market -- or macro, sorry, and then hand over to Mark for the financial questions. But as we think about the natural gas macro, I think through this earnings season, it's been fairly apparent that you're seeing companies like -- that have had maintenance level programs continue that effort this year. Range is clearly in that category as well. It's something we've talked about a lot. But also, you're starting to hear about rig activity potentially starting to slow in other basins like the Haynesville example. We think that bodes well for the go-forward outlook for natural gas. You've got Freeport LNG, now starting to see feedgas come through the facility and ships start to leave the docks. And we think that's also no doubt constructive and positive for the go-forward look. And then we've, of course, got the next wave of LNG that will be coming online starting some time in the balance of 2024. So we think all of this aligns well, as we look forward. You couple that with the demand outlook that's still going to be materializing in the background through '23 and '24. You're still talking about something, as you kind of link all this back to a day supply from a natural gas perspective that's not too dissimilar before we were at, before going into this winter. So we think that this still could have, no doubt, a constructive outlook as we start to see activity start to modulate through the balance of the year, especially in the basins that have had a higher level of activity going forward. NGL piece, Alan touched on it a number of times in prior calls, but as you start to look at the number of exports, barrels that are leaving the docks from a propane perspective as an example and LPG, we're still seeing some record level exports occur today, which is really encouraging. And of course, we're all watching the reopening of China take place. And we know that, that will translate into further supporting of reducing stock levels and continuing to support a back half of the year constructive outlook for further NGL price improvements. And I'll turn it over to Mark for the financial piece.Mark S. ScucchiI think the nature of your question is in and of itself important, that at Range this year, as we look at prices, obviously off somewhat from the last year or so, our story remains the same. We're talking about free cash flow and the same business plan that we've talked about for the last couple of years: Generate free cash flow, reduce debt, return capital to shareholders, all while executing on a really efficient capital program. Looking at full cycle cost structure, looking at our line items, unit costs remain extremely competitive. And certainly on the capital front, if you take CapEx dollar per Mcfe, it will be best in the business. So with that, we're talking about free cash flow generation and degrees of free cash flow generation. So to your question more directly, how do we think about the allocation between debt and share repurchases? We haven't hardcoded that with a specific percentage. But what I'll say is -- or reiterate is, our priority is debt reduction. But we're very close to coming within our targeted net debt range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We're just a couple of hundred million away from that. And free cash flow examples we have on Slide 7 of the investor relations deck provides some hypothetical context around that. So free cash flow generation this year could quite easily put us within that range, in the coming quarter or 2, which gives us latitude on share repurchases and certainly keeps us in firm support of our dividend going forward and keeping that an integral part of the program. So we have incremental latitude, as we get within that range. In 2023, as we get within that net debt range, we've got incremental latitude on how to execute on the share repurchase program. So, I would give you the example of what we did in 2022. Over the course of the year, as we pay down debt, we ratably increased share repurchases. We were responsive to prices in our overall free cash flow generation, and in principle, will be the same in 2023 and going forward.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of John Abbott of BofA.John Holliday AbbottI'm on for Doug Leggate. Our first question is -- there was some obvious M&amp;A chatter last week. If anything might have missed -- might have highlighted the misvaluation in Range's shares. What can you do at this point to further bolster recognition of the value opportunity for Range?Jeffrey L. VenturaWell, I would argue just consistently execute. Stick on the plan we are on, which is, I think, a really strong story of having best-in-class inventory, really long core inventory. We put some new data in the deck to kind of highlight that, and give you more color. Having the lowest cost per Mcfe added, being able to do that for a long, long time into what we think are better markets. So I think it's just consistent execution. Mark just talked about our strategy and return of capital, and prioritization of that.John Holliday AbbottAppreciate it. And then, Jeff, for the second question, you highlighted the inventory and you've had the benefits of 15,000-foot laterals. I mean, just sort of when you look at your inventory in general, what is the opportunity on the 15,000-foot lateral plus, going forward?Jeffrey L. VenturaI mean it's the beauty of our position being a first mover, having a big blocky position, which we think is the best area of stack pays, and with the really talented team that keeps finding ways to add value. So extending laterals, landing, loading, et cetera, I think our team has demonstrated year in and year out, that we can add value and do it -- just get a little bit better each year. And you'll see when you look at the recoveries per thousand and things like that in there, the team -- we're one of the few companies in the industry that consistently be able to replicate those results, or improve when others are seeing core exhaustions. Dennis, do you want to add anything to that?Dennis L. DegnerYes, I think if you look back, I'll just add one quick item. If you look back over, what your question was, what's the opportunity there? We see it's a long runway. A year ago, I believe at this call or at the April call, we kind of walked through an example of where the pad sites we had returned to versus the pad sites we have not yet returned to. And it was -- the pads we've returned to only represented a small percentage of the overall data set. This past year, we returned to a pad site again for the third time, and we drilled more lateral footage in that third return, than we did in the prior 2, showing the further continual incremental development of drilling long laterals, having some of our most efficient D&amp;C development costs, and utilization of those roads, infrastructure, gathering system, et cetera. So we see a long runway, as we think about our inventory total and the ability to return to those pad sites and have further capital-efficient leading cost structures.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Paul Diamond of Citi.Paul Michael DiamondJust a quick question here. So you place our expectations through the year, obviously, still trending directionally upward. Are you guys -- in your conversations, are you guys seeing any of those -- or just in the aggregate, anything particularly starting to break? Or anything in particular where those concerns are softening?Jeffrey L. VenturaYou're specifically talking about cost and inflation? Just to clarify your question.Paul Michael DiamondI'm sorry. Yes, that's correct.Jeffrey L. VenturaGo ahead, Dennis.Dennis L. DegnerYes, as we -- I'll kind of take a half a step back and what we're not seeing is questions or requests to increase cost today. What we have seen is, we'll call it, a stabilization. As you start to look through the balance of this year, though, we would expect with some of the announcements of rig activity, starting to maybe slow in other basins, these maintenance level programs that have been announced, we would expect that as you get deeper into the year, there would be further opportunities that will surface for us to reduce service costs -- and that could come in a variety of forms and fashions. I think, if you look at where as an example, where fuel prices are today versus maybe where they were in the back half of 2022, that could present an opportunity to shore up, let's just say, some savings for the balance of the year, along with tubular goods starting to see some relief. So we would expect the deeper you get into the year, there would be some opportunities that would further present themselves for service cost reductions.Paul Michael DiamondUnderstood. And, I just have one quick follow-up. Given the volatility that we're seeing in the market in Nat Gas -- natural gas pricing, is there a point directionally, either upward or downward, that would kind of have you guys revisiting your operational plan for the year? Or is it pretty much locked in?Mark S. ScucchiThis is Mark. I'll kick that one off. I think, as we've each mentioned in various forms throughout our discussions for this morning, we're talking about degrees of free cash flow. So I'll bring it back to our waterfall and capital allocation. First is reinvesting cash flow to maintain production levels, that maximizes margins. We have a well utilized infrastructure system that delivers production to a diverse set of locations. 90% of our revenue roughly is outside the Appalachian Basin, across gas and natural gas liquids. So we're coming into this market, where prices may be softer this year, but we're still generating extremely competitive returns and able to reduce debt and return capital to shareholders. So, I think, being at a maintenance level of spend again this year, still is prudent reinvestment to the cash flow of the business. And, as far as being adapted to prices, we've also got a good base set of hedges that further insulate cash flow and provide us greater predictability near and medium term. And then of course we'll be responsive to any severe moves. We clearly are not going to look away from prices and the realities of realized netbacks. But all that being said, under virtually any reasonable pricing scenario, we've got a variety of scenarios down to $2.50, for example, on Page 7 of our deck, Range is generating extremely competitive levels of free cash flow. So we feel good about the program, and don't expect there to be any material alteration. That said, we remain nimble and we'll adapt as need be.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities.Neal David DingmannHope you can hear me, a little bit loud here. My question is on oilfield services. I'm just wondering you've seen, a bit of a decline now in some of the gas areas like here. I'm just wondering, has that shown through on, maybe not rigs yet, but maybe some of the other oilfield services? Or is it maybe still too early to tell?Dennis L. DegnerYes. Thanks for the question, Neal. I'd say it's a little bit early, I think, for those service cost reductions to at this point, fully surfaced. But again, I kind of tried to touch on this just a little bit earlier. The good news is we're not seeing any further requests for increases at this time. We've seen, in some ways, a good strong stabilization of the service cost market. But we fully expect, as rigs fully materialize and being dropped in the months ahead, and we start to get deeper into the year, there to be further opportunities for us to evaluate service cost reduction opportunities. And I'll throw this on. I mean, we also -- service cost is always one component of our cost structure, but our efficiencies are the other. As we look at, how we are attacking the program this year, we would further expect to repeat our efficiencies and continue to build upon them, further reducing that cost structure. So as you kind of dial all this back, we kind of feel like, at the end of the day, and Mark has touched on it this morning as well in his remarks. But we expect, regardless of the outcome to be at the leading edge of what that dollar per M efficiency value looks like at that 76 level.Neal David DingmannGood point. And one follow-up. Just I think you and Jeff talked about this, but on the additional inventory to inventory you see for the next year or 2, is most of that -- will that be the longer laterals? Or could you just -- may be possible a little color on the type of wells you anticipate there? It seems like they will -- it seems like you're insinuating that you could see a bit bigger -- better margins on that pipe. I'm just wonder if that's because of the long potential laterals? Or is there more things to that?Dennis L. DegnerYes. As we think about the inventory that we're adding this year, it's really to do a couple of things. One, it allows us to have some optionality as we think about 2024 and 2025. But if you really take a step back, we're really talking about adding somewhere between 1 to 2 pad sites of wells and wellbores. And so again, that's going to allow us to further operationally derisk the program, not only maintain our current efficiency levels, but also to build upon them. And as we kind of look at the drilling efficiencies and records that the team said already in 2023, by having some of those efficiencies that we're already capturing, plus completion efficiency improvements from last year, you can see some of that activity then further making it into this year's program. But again, we also like the optionality that it has for next year, and that can be capital that comes out of next year program, or become still a part of the base program in 2024 and '25.Neal David DingmannThank you, that you all spending that now.Dennis L. DegnerCan you repeat that, Neal?Neal David DingmannAppreciate really good to see that you all spending that now for next year's bill.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.Arun JayaramJeff, Mark, I wanted to get your thoughts on just potentially unlocking value. It's clear that you think the stock is undervalued based on your PV-10 update at strip. And I was wondering your thoughts, on how you unlock value beyond using the buyback? And if someone came knocking on the door, what type of approach would you take in terms of evaluating some sort of bid? And just frame that relative to your views on what's an appropriate call it, mid-cycle natural gas price?Jeffrey L. VenturaYes, I'd just say you're talking about if somebody came knocking on the door. So clearly, you're probably referring to the Reuters article. And the good news there is pioneer confirmed their position that they're not considering a deal. And then the good part is the position we're in. We're extremely confident in our inventory life and in our assets, and our ability to deliver shareholder value. So we're in a great position, we don't need to pursue any sort of M&amp;A. And again, back to -- we can talk about unlocking value. I think just consistently executing, you're seeing again, if you look at in your work that you put out in some of your research, you see declining productivity in most basins and in most companies across the U.S., no matter what basin it's in. We're unique in that we're one of the few companies that doesn't see that, that you're seeing consistent results year after year. In fact, when you look at Page 30 and our future projections of drilling, like in a wet area, EURs per 1,000, over 3 Bcf per 1,000, we're confident in those numbers. We're one of the few companies that had positive reserve revisions 15 years in a row. So I think just consistently executing into what we think is a better environment will add value. But Mark, do you want to comment?Mark S. ScucchiYes. I think Arun, you asked a question about basically, I'll rephrase it. When does the market recognize the value of Range? Or even more broadly, just energy? I think you've got a slow return of investor dollars into the sector. You have the energy sector had gone down to what, roughly 2% of S&amp;P 500. We're getting back close to 5%-ish ZIP code. As you look at what free cash flow yields are for energy, specifically upstream. And then more specifically, Range, you're talking teens of north of greater than 20% free cash flow yield, for Range under whatever your price expectations are. Those are valuations of a company with a multi-decade inventory, with 15 years of production history to prove it and audited reserves to back that up, that it simply can't be ignored over the long haul. It -- does it take a few more quarters? Does it take some stability in commodity prices to allow perhaps more generalists to come back in, and begin to step in? Perhaps. And that's fine. That is something that the consistency of the Range program, the stability of our drilling program, the diversity of our outlets, I think, allows us to prove up over time, in the interim, just simply generating significant cash flow and reinvesting in our business proves our point. So, I think, we can continue to highlight that. We have very constructive dialogue with investors. In fact, the volume of that dialogue, in number of phone calls is as high as we've ever seen it. So we feel very good about the state of Investor Relations, and the general trend of our shareholder base. And I think the premium of our inventory, both the quality and the depth of that inventory, is recognized in our relative valuation to our closest peers. So we'll continue to highlight that. And I think over near and medium term, that will continue to be rewarded and better recognized in the price of the stock. So, we have a great stand-alone plan, a great business to operate here, and a lot of value yet to deliver.Arun JayaramAppreciate the fulsome answer. My follow-up is, I don't know if Alan is on the line, but I wanted to get some thoughts. You gave us a $15.1 billion approved reserve PV-10 value, using the strip. I was wondering if you could break out maybe the PDP value embedded in that number. And, I noted that you made some minor tweaks to your type curves. You raised your wet area type curve by about 7%. And dry gas came down a little bit. Is it just maybe you could address some of the changes to the type curves as well.Alan W. FarquharsonSure. Let me address the type curve first, and I'll take it in reverse order. I think, if you look at the last several years, from '20 through '22 well results, I think really dictate the increase in terms of the wet gas area. Well performance continues to remain strong. We continue to drill really high-quality wells. If you notice some of the wells in '21, we're probably some of the best wells that we've ever drilled in the play, as a matter of fact. So it really suggests that there's a high quality of locations left when you look at the slide of our inventory slide, you see very low breakeven costs on a portion of our well they would reiterate and support, extremely great well performance. So, I think what you see is just recognition. Historically, we have never gone out and after a year, increase the type curve. We look at a little bit longer term. Support data to be able to increase it. And of course, the development plan that we have identified for the next 5-plus years, we'll also support that as well. Minor tweak down on gas, just once again, kind of looking at where the well results have been, and recognizing that and looking at where the well performance of what we can expect to see going forward. So we have a much larger position in the wet gas portion, than what we do to the [drug], so there's a lot more of the inventory that's going to be wet, so it's going to be sustainable for a longer period of time. On the first part of the question, I don't remember what the PDP percentage is. So we will get back with you. I'll get with Laith and the team, and we'll get back with you on that as well. I just don't recall on the top of my head.Jeffrey L. VenturaOn Slide 5, kind of is a new slide with more of that color and detail that Alan was referring to, in the deck.OperatorWe are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to David Deckelbaum of Cowen for our final question.David Adam DeckelbaumCan you hear me?OperatorYes, we can hear you.Jeffrey L. VenturaYes, we can.David Adam DeckelbaumI just wanted to ask about the lateral length progression first. It sounds like 2022 was kind of like a landmark year in terms of average lateral length. Obviously, the till count goes up a bit in '23, as lateral lines comes down, it seems like there's still some potential to increase that throughout the year. How does that look when you get beyond '23, into the '24 and '25? Or should we see the program kind of conforming towards this 10,000-foot kind of standardized lateral, that you have assumed in long-term costs?Dennis L. DegnerDavid, I would say, as we look forward, we have yet to experience the technical limit of our horizontal lateral capacity. But we also take a very methodical, data-driven approach to how we extend laterals because I know you've heard us talk about this on prior calls, but in order to be successful, we know we need to be repeatable. And so making big leaps is something that we're not opposed to doing, but we try to incrementally extend our lateral lengths and operationally take those learnings, so that we can do it in a very cost-effective way, we can also be very repeatable. I think, if you look back over the last couple of years, as you point out, we continue to make a progression to -- as we just touched on in our prepared remarks, we drilled some of our top 15 longest laterals in the balance of the fourth quarter, and we have more wells like that planned for the 2023 program. As we look at our, internally, our 5-year plan and outlook of well inventory, where we would move rigs to gathering system, and how that would complement that activity level there are lots of wells that we would consider to be at or beyond that 15,000-foot level. But as you move throughout the field, there will be cases, where maybe you have some lease limitations that would pervade you from always drilling in excess of 15,000 feet or which then creates more of an average of 10,000. We know that our long laterals create our most capital-efficient opportunity. And so we see a really, really long runway with our inventory to be able to drill extended reach laterals, and we'll continue to do so.David Adam DeckelbaumAnd then as my second question, this, Jeff, maybe to close out the call on something a little bit more exciting. Just it sounds like you confirmed that perhaps there were not conversations around M&amp;A last week. But longer term, does the Board or management believe that there is perhaps a philosophical goal of getting towards, perhaps some sort of combination with an oil-weighted company to create a differentiated investment proposition as an organization? Or given your constructive view in gas macro, do you think your best path forward is the focus on core natural gas development in the U.S.?Jeffrey L. VenturaYes. To answer that, I would just say we're really in a great position. We have, what we believe is the largest core inventory in the best gas field in the world. Big, blocky position. We have the new disclosure on Page 5 or whatever talking about the quality of the wells and the longevity. So we can -- we've got the lowest decline rate. We've got the lowest cost structure into what we think is going to be a much better natural gas story long term. I think natural gas is going to be a great place to be. There's a lot -- we think -- and there's a slide in the back. LNG, we talked about the next wave -- big wave in 2025. Dennis says it starts in 2024. But when you look at our slide in the back, we see that by the end of '27, LNG exports 29 Bcf per day, and there's a slide in there, and that describes them. So when you -- we've got the ability to access those markets. So we think we're in a great position where -- we can just -- and we will consistently execute and create value that we're in great shape. We want to just continue to do what we're doing.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.Jeffrey L. VenturaYes. I just want to thank everybody for taking time to be on the call this morning. And feel free to follow up with our team, if you have additional questions. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.]"

The inflation is turning out to be more “sticky” than expected. This has increased the chances that the Federal Reserve will continue raising the interest rates and then keep the rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.Higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in the latter part of 2023. This has resulted in bearish investor sentiments. Under such a scenario, it is difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns.One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like State Street Corporation STT, Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. UVE and Ralph Lauren Corporation RL are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They precisely assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Selecting the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help you in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (Four Weeks) of 1% or More: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price Greater Than $5: The stocks must trade above $5.Average 20-Day Volume Greater Than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank Equal to #1 or 2: Despite good or bad market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven record of success. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are three of the five stocks that qualified for the screening:Boston, MA-based State Street is a financial holding company. STT provides a range of products and services for institutional investors worldwide through its subsidiaries.The company’s earnings for 2023 are expected to increase 16.2%.

BIG is likely to report a decrease in the top and the bottom line from the last fiscal year’s quarterly reading in its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Mar 2, before the market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter’s bottom line is currently at a loss of 57 cents per share, wider than the loss of 29 cents pegged 30 days ago. The company delivered earnings of $1.75 per share in the year-earlier quarter.The consensus mark for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1,553 million, indicating a 10.6% drop from the last fiscal year’s quarterly reported number.We expect revenues to fall 12% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally to $1,523.6 million and the adjusted loss to decline 117.8% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s level to 31 cents per share.This Columbus, OH-based player delivered a negative earnings surprise of 37.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Key Factors to NoteBig Lots’ quarterly performance might have been hurt by a challenging macroeconomic landscape, including headwinds like supply-chain challenges and inflationary pressures. Any deleverage in SG&amp;A costs might have been added deterrents. The increased outbound transportation expenses and occupancy costs are adding to deleveraged SG&amp;A costs In addition, Big Lots has been witnessing increased freight costs for a while. All these factors might have hurt BIG’s performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.On its last earnings call, management had projected the top-line performance to remain challenging. It anticipated a comparable sales decline in the low-double-digit range for the fiscal fourth quarter. Big Lots highlighted that the gross margin is likely to be hurt by additional markdowns related to accelerated store closures and continued efforts to reduce inventory. However, it expected a sequential gross-margin improvement for the fourth quarter, resulting in a gross margin rate in the mid-30s.Further, management had forecast SG&amp;A expenses to remain flat year over year in the quarter under review due to accelerated depreciation from fourth-quarter store closures, higher occupancy costs, elevated outbound transportation expenses and costs related to two incremental forward distribution centers.On the flip side, Big Lots’ Operation North Star initiative and e-commerce business appear encouraging. BIG’s Broyhill and Real Living brands are performing well. Management is also consistently taking steps to control expenses.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Big Lots this time around.

QuoteFactors to NoteAaron’s has been gaining from solid customer demand, strategic investments in centralized lease decisioning, robust e-commerce business, strength in the GenNext store program and the BrandsMart buyout. The company has been on track with its efforts to enhance customers' in-store and digital experiences.It has been witnessing strength in its e-commerce platform, driven by enhanced digital payment and servicing platforms. Also, the rising website traffic and a higher conversion rate are likely to have acted as upsides. Some other notable efforts include increased investments in digital marketing, improved shopping experience, same-day and next-day delivery facilities, personalization of products, and a broader assortment, including the latest product categories. Its express delivery program also bodes well.The sturdy performance in GenNext stores is expected to have been a key growth driver. Aaron’s newly acquired appliance and electronics retailer, BrandsMart, is likely to have strengthened its market position and expanded the customer base. The deal is expected to have aided Aaron’s top line in the fourth quarter.Consequently, management, in its last earnings report, raised its 2022 guidance. The company anticipated revenues of $2.23-$2.27 billion, up from the earlier mentioned $2.19-$2.27 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was predicted to be $160-$170 million compared with the prior stated $150-$170 million.

Adjusted EBITDA was forecast to be $190-$195 million compared with the prior mentioned $180-$195 million. Same-store revenues were predicted to decline 7-6%, up from the earlier stated 8-6% decline. In BrandsMart, revenues were anticipated to be $550-$565 million, up from the prior mentioned $545-$565 million. Adjusted EBITDA was expected to be $20-$25 million.However, the company has been witnessing dismal margins and a higher provision for lease merchandise write-offs at the Aaron's Business. Also, lower lease revenues and reduced lease portfolio size, the lower exercise of early purchase options, smaller same-store lease portfolio size and drab retail sales are likely to have acted as deterrents.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Aaron's this season.

Showing some growth over the holiday season but warning it could see a slowdown. CEO Brian Cornell saying that it continues to be a very challenging environment, and Target's CFO joined Yahoo Finance earlier today and shared a similar sentiment.- And we see a consumer that's leaning in to some of those seasonal moments. We are pleased with results in Valentine's Day, but we're mindful of the trends that we saw emerge in the fourth quarter, and we think it's appropriate to plan cautiously in that environment. You know, there's some uncertainty as we look out and see what 2023 might hold, and we want to make sure that we're planning prudently against that backdrop.DAVE BRIGGS: He went on to say Target is focusing on getting that inventory story under control, which they are showing the numbers in favor of that somewhat, but it's going to be a challenge given how we're seeing Walmart continue to chip away at their business-- in particular, some of those high-income shoppers, which has been a real surprise in the latest quarterly results, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Dave, it certainly has been. And when you take a look at those quarterly results, stock up Target. Compare that to what we saw from Walmart and the difference that we're seeing in stores of-- in terms of comp sales. Q4 comp sales for Target you're looking at on your screen. Up just about 7/10 of a percent compared to a more than 8% jump that we saw at Walmart. So you certainly are seeing more and more consumers trading down maybe to Walmart.So Target has to do something at this point. They are taking some steps to launch some of their-- more of their own brands. They're launching more than 10 own brands. Among them-- or expanding those-- Cat &amp; Jack, which is the kids line, something I use all the time. Certainly on the lower end of the price range, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. That has certainly worked for its consumers in the past.Story continuesAnd, Dave, they're also going to be adding more items, offering more items in the $3 to $10 to $15 range, which maybe that will do the trick and help them get some consumers-- more consumers through their doors.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, the private-label brand Target and Walmart have in common. You're seeing everyone really go to that move. Amazon's doing it. Kroger is doing it. Costco is doing it. Everyone launching their own private label brands, in particular because they were up 11% overall in 2022. And for Target, they far exceeded that, up 18% in terms of their private-label brands. So that is clearly an advantage they seek to take more advantage of.Consumers' spending habits have indeed changed, and that's what Brian Cornell talked a lot about. Discretionary spending down 13%. So you're really seeing people pull back when it comes to home and apparel. They continue to spend on food and beverage. And the one right in the middle, Seana, that almost seems like we have to ask ourselves if it is a discretionary item is cosmetics, makeup. People do continue to spend on those, which almost feels like a staple at this point based on what we've seen from some other retailers.SEANA SMITH: I would consider it a staple. I think it's a necessity for everyday life, but hey, that's just me. So I think it makes a lot of sense that people continue to buy those products.Also Target relying a little bit more heavily on its loyalty program, making some improvements there. Saying that they're going to try and make it, quote, ""more compelling promotions and improvements there to try and help get that return customer,"" which we know is so critical, especially in times of uncertainty like this.]"

Many, including high-income households, are buying more store-label brands as budgets stretch in the face of higher interest rates.Minneapolis-based Target, which has nearly 2,000 stores, reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street’s expectations for the first time in a year, as it shifted its focus to selling more food and lower-priced items under its higher-margin private-label brands including Favorite Day, Good &amp; Gather and Mondo Llama.Target generates more than $30 billion in sales from its 48-owned brands, the company disclosed in a presentation on Tuesday adding that these brands grew faster than overall sales in 2022.Now it plans to double down on its in-house products.Target said it plans to launch or expand more than 10 owned brands, adding thousands of new products. The majority of these items will be sold for $3, $5, $10 and $15, according to the retailer.The move comes after Target saw higher sales of $3 ornaments, $5 candles and $10 throw pillows, Christina Hennington, the company's chief growth officer, said on a call on Tuesday.It also follows discount chain Five Below Inc's plans to open more than 200 new stores in 2023 and convert 400 existing stores to its ""Five Beyond"" format, which sells items priced above its $5 threshold.CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said Target's motive to lower prices was to drive more traffic to its stores.Story continues""It is nice to see Target invest in own brands and use that as a way to keep differentiating themselves against Walmart and Kroger,"" he said.Consumer prices rose at a more rapid monthly pace in January, the Labor Department reported earlier this month. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.5% in January, as prices for food, fuel and apparel accelerated at a more rapid rate. In the 12 months through January, inflation was 6.4%, compared to 6.5% in December.Walmart executives said last week that they have seen stretched consumers gravitate towards private label, such as its Great Value and Equate brands.Target's private-label brands are generally more expensive than at Walmart, a Reuters review of their online prices showed. In one example, a 64-ounce Great Value bottle of orange juice sells for $2.98 on Walmart.com compared with $3.69 for Good &amp; Gather orange juice in the same size.Dollar Tree, which dropped its long-standing $1 policy in November 2021, said last year its focus to offer more $3 to $5 items was working for its products that competed against those in grocery and drugstores, and led to its first traffic increase in three years during its third-quarter ended October 29 last year.The Virginia-based chain said it was planning on adding more $3 and $5 items to its fleet of 16,000 stores in the years ahead.

Bridge is a digital platform that connects SMBs with a diverse group of more than 70 lenders that provide qualifying businesses with loans of up to $10 million.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230228006155/en/Through a single loan request form, Walmart suppliers can interact with a broad group of lenders located across the United States. Once a request is submitted, the platform seamlessly connects suppliers with multiple potential lenders that can evaluate their requests. This provides for a more efficient loan process for both the suppliers and lenders and empowers suppliers by offering them greater choice, convenience, and access to capital. It also provides lenders with the potential to expand their reach beyond their immediate local market and diversify their lending businesses. In preparation for this launch, the platform’s lender base has grown from 18 banks in 2021 to more than 70 lenders nationwide currently on the platform.""At Walmart, we know small- and medium-sized businesses are the engine that drives the U.S. economy and local communities. Many diverse owned businesses also fit the small- and medium-sized business profile. As such we stand to strengthen our longstanding Supplier Inclusion offering through this specific opportunity,"" said Jason Fremstad, Senior Vice President of Supplier Development at Walmart. ""By leveraging the platform, our suppliers can have better access to the funding they need to expand their operations to reach and surpass their goals. Greater access to capital will help our suppliers continue to provide the products that our customers are looking for.""Story continuesWorking capital loans, commercial mortgages and other pre-shipment financing loans are among the potential loans extended by some of the lenders on the platform. Walmart has programs that help with post-shipment financing, but Bridge built by Citi has the potential to expand options available to qualifying suppliers.Bridge was developed to provide more inclusive access to capital while supporting innovative, digital-first solutions for SMBs. ""Many small and medium-sized business owners don’t have a network of existing bank relationships – especially those operating in underrepresented communities,"" said Rohit Mathur, Head of the Bridge built by Citi platform. ""Bridge offers a modern and efficient way for Walmart’s U.S. suppliers to navigate the lending process and cultivate relationships with multiple lenders while helping them gain access to the capital that is essential for them to grow.""In preparation for engaging Walmart’s supplier network, Citi focused on increasing the number of Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) on the platform. Of the more than 70 lenders currently participating on the Bridge built by Citi platform, more than 20 are MDIs and four are women-owned institutions. In addition, 15 of the 20 Black-owned banks in the U.S. are lenders on the platform. Citi and Walmart are proud to help introduce suppliers to financial institutions that are committed to serving their communities and promoting racial and gender equity.M&amp;F Bank in North Carolina has used the platform to source opportunities to lend hundreds of thousands of dollars to businesses they would not have found otherwise. ""We’re proud to be part of a platform that enables us to connect with our target market in a more intentional and efficient way and are excited to now extend our reach to Walmart’s extensive supplier network,"" says M&amp;F Bank CEO James Sills. ""By growing and diversifying our business mix, Bridge enables us to make even more of a positive impact on the communities we serve.""In addition to the introduction of Bridge built by Citi to Walmart suppliers, Walmart and Citi will also collaborate to provide suppliers with educational content to increase financial literacy.""At Citi, we are focused on delivering innovative solutions that create value for our clients and contribute to a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem. This includes our collaborations with clients and partners such as Walmart to identify optimal paths for the solutions we are creating,"" says Emily Turner, Head of Business Development, Institutional Clients Group at Citi.Walmart suppliers can access the platform and review terms of use through a dedicated website: www.bridgebuiltbyciti.com/walmart.Note: Neither Walmart nor Citi have any influence in lending decisions, nor do they participate as lenders on the platform.

JWN is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers on Mar 2, after the closing bell. The fashion specialty retailer is expected to have witnessed revenue and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents per share, suggesting a 47.2% decline from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $4.33 billion, indicating a decrease of 3.6% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 42.9%.

Price and EPS SurpriseNordstrom, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNordstrom’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of a dismal holiday season. Last month, the company reported soft holiday results, wherein sales declined 3.5% year over year in the nine-week period ended Dec 31, 2022. Banner-wise, Nordstrom sales fell 1.7% and sales at Nordstrom Rack decreased 7.6%.The decline was mainly due to high promotions and sluggish sales than the pre-pandemic levels. Reduced consumer spending, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, acted as a headwind. The company has been gaining from positive pricing and broad-based growth across core categories and regions.In order to end fiscal 2022 with healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom undertook additional markdowns. As a result, it expects year-end inventory levels to decline in the double-digits year over year at the end of fiscal 2022.Driven by the soft holiday season performance, management lowered its fiscal 2022 guidance. The company anticipates revenue growth, including retail sales and credit card revenues, at the lower end of the prior mentioned 5-7%. The EBIT margin is expected to be 2.8-3.1%, which indicates lower-than-expected gross margins due to additional markdowns. The adjusted EBIT margin is forecast to be 3.1-3.3%. SG&amp;A expenses are expected to reflect gains from the company's supply-chain optimization initiatives and ongoing cost-saving efforts.Adjusted earnings are likely to be $1.5-$1.7 per share, with reported EPS of $1.33-$1.53. The tax rate is expected to be 17%. Meanwhile, the leverage ratio is likely to be slightly above 3.0 times by the year end compared with the prior view of below 2.9 times.However, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset the aforementioned declines.Nordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, improving its supply-chain channels, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com into Nordstrom.com is anticipated to have contributed to the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Nordstrom this time around.

Del RioThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year like no other in our company's 56-year history. As we successfully concluded our Great Cruise Comeback with the last vessel in our fleet reentering service midway through the year. Our team continually push forward to this challenging transition year, achieving several significant milestones on our road to recovery and preparing for the next chapter of our storied brands. With our full fleet back to the high seas, we significantly ramped up occupancy levels carrying nearly 1.7 million guests welcomed our newest ship, Norwegian Prima to our world-class fleet, reached several critical financial inflection points, maintained our industry-leading pricing and perhaps more telling, ended the year in a record booked position for 2023 and at record prices. These accomplishments are even more impressive when considering they were achieved against the backdrop of lingering COVID-19 impacts as well as ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. I want to take the opportunity to once again thank our entire team, both shoreside and shipboard for their hard work, dedication and tenacity, which has propelled us forward as we strive to be the vacation of choice for everyone around the world. I'm incredibly proud, honored and inspired to work alongside each and every one of you. And I also want to express our sincere thanks to our loyal guests, value travel partners, lenders, shipyards, investors and all of our stakeholders for their continued support and partnership. Shifting our attention to what is certainly a bright future for our company, let's turn to Slide 6, which outlines our current positioning and the key catalysts we have on the horizon. First, we are encouraged to see that our target consumer, which tends to skew more upmarket in the broader cruise industry, continues to be financially healthy and resilient and is prioritizing consumption of experiences over the purchase of physical goods. We've talked previously about the 2 high-level indicators we carefully monitor to evaluate the willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel. The first being the length of the booking curve, which is a forward-looking indicator and the second one being onboard revenue, a real-time indicator of a consumer's actual spending, both of which continue to hold strong with no signs of fading. In fact, the booking window in the fourth quarter was well elongated compared to the same quarter in 2019. Onboard revenue also continues to be a bright spot with gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, approximately 25% higher than the comparable 2019 period. The bottom line is our target consumer continues to be willing to spend on travel and experiences now and in the future. This gives us confidence that not only is the incredible value proposition for cruising resonating with consumers, but the unique and compelling offerings of our 3 brands are also appealing to their respective markets. Second, we are taking actions across our business to align with our strategic priorities and strengthen the foundation for sustained profitable growth. This includes a broad and ongoing initiative we began in the fourth quarter to improve operating efficiencies and to rightsize our cost base so that we can rebuild and enhance our margins. You may ask why start this initiative now? While the past few years have been unlike anything we could have imagined. First, we were focused on taking the necessary measures to withstand a prolonged and unprecedented period of disruption by minimizing cash burn, raising capital, enhancing our health and safety programs to adapt to a rapidly evolving public health environment and advocating for the industry to restart cruise operations. We then shifted our focus to relaunching our operations while providing our discerning guests the same unparalleled vacation experience they expect from our leading brands. We also took this unique opportunity to raise the bar on pricing for the long term. Now that our phased occupancy ramp is nearly complete, and our loyal guests know that cruising in our brands is back and even better than before, we are squarely focused on how to maximize profitability as we embark on a period of transformational growth. Every aspect of our business is being evaluated through the lens of how we can realize our full value potential for all stakeholders. We are exploring further opportunities, first and foremost, to reduce our cost profile and to maximize revenue generation. You've likely seen some of the actions we've already taken to improve our cost structure, including normalization of marketing spend, corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and thoughtful rationalization of product delivery. We will continue to leave no stone on turn as we identify and evaluate incremental opportunities. And of course, we will not lose sight of our guests, the very heart of our business, and we will continue to prioritize delivering an exceptional guest experience and superior service levels. The last catalyst I want to touch on is our industry-leading new build pipeline. This year, for the first time in our history, we are gearing up to deliver 1 new build for each of our brands, as shown on Slide 7, adding over 5,000 additional births to our fleet including an over 20% increase in our upscale births. On a capacity day basis, this will result in approximately 19% growth in 2023 compared to 2019. As you can see on Slide 8, we have made some modifications to our newbuild pipeline primarily related to the last 2 shifts in the Prima Class. These ships have been lengthened in part to accommodate the future use of alternative fuels. We now expect gross tonnage for the third and fourth Prima Class to be approximately 10% larger and the fifth and sixth Prima Class ships to be approximately 20% larger than Norwegian Prima and Viva. As a result, delivery days have shifted a bit, and we now expect 1 larger Prima Class ship to be delivered each year from 2025 to 2028. We remain confident in our ability to profitably absorb this capacity with continued consumer demand for travel, our expansion into the many unserved and underserved markets around the world that our brands have not yet tapped into, and on the broader industry's vast underpenetration particularly when compared to land-based vacation alternatives. Shifting our discussion now to our booking demand and pricing trends. As you can see on Slide 9, in the fourth quarter, our load factor reached 87%, in line with guidance. This is approximately 20% below the comparable 2019 quarter, yet demonstrates another sequential improvement in closing the occupancy gap versus 2019. This ramp is continuing through the first quarter of 2023 as we have already achieved 100% occupancy in the quarter, leading to a return to historical levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023 and beyond. In terms of pricing, Slide 10, illustrates another strong result in the pricing front with our net per diem growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, up approximately 14% on an as reported basis and up 15% in constant currency over 2019. Turning to Slide 11. At year-end, our cumulative book position for 2023 was within our optimal range of approximately 60% to 65%. We continue to believe this is our sweet spot as it strikes the delicate balance of encouraging guests to book early while also optimizing pricing. Full year '23 book position is now ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices. Since we last spoke in November, we have been pleased to see positive booking momentum continue, including a very strong wave season that likely started 2 months earlier than usual. In fact, November was a record-breaking month for Norwegian Cruise Line as they celebrate a record day, record week and record month of sales boosted by Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday push. Subsequently, in January, a strong start to traditional wave led the line of setting another record booking month. Our region brand also experienced a similar positive reception to it 2023 Wave offer launch, which resulted in a record launch day with net booking volume nearly 4x last year's Wave launch and 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Our current cumulative book position and the strong demand dynamics that we continue to experience across our brands gives us further confidence that we can achieve our 2023 guidance, which Mark will discuss shortly in more detail. I'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark?Mark A. KempaThank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth quarter 2022 financial results, 2023 guidance and the progress on our financial recovery. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics is on a constant currency basis. Slide 12 outlines key metrics highlighting our fourth quarter results, nearly all of which met or exceeded guidance. Focusing on the top line, strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, up approximately 24% versus 2019, with net per diems increasing approximately 15%, continuing the strong pricing performance we have achieved since our relaunch. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity today was in line with expectations with the second half 2022 decreasing approximately 10% versus the first half as our operations continue to ramp up. As our 2023 guidance indicates, second half 2022 is not representative of a go-forward run rate. For the second half of 2022, adjusted EBITDA was nearly breakeven. We did, however, achieve another significant milestone in the fourth quarter, generating positive adjusted free cash flow for the first time in 3 years. This represents another stepping stone as we return to a normalized operating environment. Looking at expectations for the full year 2023 on Slide 14. We are pleased to return to our normal cadence of providing annual and quarterly guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion with the high end of our targeted range, representing record adjusted EBITDA for the company. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.70 at the midpoint of our guidance. Taking a closer look at the components of this outlook, net per diem growth is expected in the range of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019. This translates to net yield for the year expected to increase in the range of 5% to 6.5%. This stellar top line performance is reflective of our go-to-market strategy and emphasis on price discipline. Moving to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $160 for the full year. This represents a nearly 15% decrease as compared to the average of $187 in the second half of 2022. The key drivers of this expected decrease includes the scaling back and normalization of marketing investments, ,which were elevated in the second half of 2022 as we focused on resetting expectations and raising the bar on pricing during our relaunch, moderation in hyperinflationary pressures in certain areas, including food and logistics, normalization of capacity days as a result of the elimination of previously acquired protocols, timing and optimization of scheduled drydocks. And finally, the results of our operating efficiency and cost minimization efforts as part of our broad and ongoing margin enhancement initiative that Frank touched on. Keep in mind that costs are expected to sequentially trend lower over the course of the year as occupancy increases and reduction initiatives are realized, which is expected to lead to a lower cost run rate as we exit 2023 as compared to our full year guidance. As we have consistently communicated, our costs will be elevated when compared to 2019 baseline, both due to normal and hyperinflation over the past 3 to 4 years as well as a mixed headwind as we add higher operating cost capacity, which we do expect will gain a premium on the top line. I want to reiterate that we are committed to rightsizing our cost base and are taking deliberate actions across our business to best position us for the future as a stronger and leaner organization. There is no silver bullet, but we will continue to evaluate all opportunities to accelerate revenue and improve operating efficiencies while continuing to deliver an exceptional guest experience. Our goal is not only to rebuild our margins, but over time, continue to enhance them, and we look forward to demonstrating this improvement over the coming quarters. Now let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. Compared to 2019 levels, net per diem is expected to increase approximately 6.75% to 7.75%, while net yield is expected to increase approximately 1.25% to 2.25%, primarily as a result of our continued occupancy ramp and with pricing expected to be higher for the remaining quarters of 2023. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $165 or approximately 12% below the second half of 2022. First quarter is expected to be the highest cost quarter due to lower occupancy and as actions taken in recent months to reduce costs will not yet be fully realized. When looking at our implied guidance for the remaining quarters of 2023, the expected decrease in cost is approximately 16% compared to the same period in 2022. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $195 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be a loss of approximately $0.45. Moving to our balance sheet. Slide 15 demonstrates the results of our deliberate and opportunistic measures to optimize our debt maturity profile. In 2023, we have approximately $1 billion of scheduled debt service, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. In recent months, we also addressed a large portion of our 2024 maturities. First, we completed an amendment of our operating credit facility and extended approximately $1.4 billion of this facility by 1 year to January 2025. Earlier this month, we took advantage of significant improvements in the bond markets to complete a refinancing transaction of the remaining nonextended term loans under the operating credit facility. We issued $600 million of new 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and use the proceeds to repay these term loans, allowing us to derisk and replace near-term debt maturities with longer-dated debt at only a marginally higher cost. As you can see, with these actions, we have a manageable maturity profile over the course of the next few years. When you look at the totality of our debt, approximately 40% is ECA back debt. This is a unique differentiator of the cruise industry, which is part of a broader connected ecosystem, which includes, among others, the operators, the shipyards and the governments and export credit agencies, all of which rely on shipyards and suppliers for significant economic and employment related benefits. As all of our interests closely align, these partners are incredibly supportive as demonstrated by the very efficient financing we are able to secure for our new builds as well as the support they provided during the pandemic. For additional detail on the breakdown of upcoming debt payments, we also provide a detailed schedule on our Investor Relations website. Turning to liquidity. Our overall liquidity position remains strong. And just last night, we announced 2 transactions, which further enhance our liquidity and outlined on page -- on Slide 16. First, we revised and extend our existing $1 billion undrawn backstop commitment. As part of the agreement to secure a second year extension option on the commitment, the company issued $250 million of 9.75% notes due 2028. At the same time, we revised the undrawn commitment to reduce the amount to $650 million, with the agreement now extending through February 2024 with the option at our sole election to extend through 2025. We do not currently intend to draw on this commitment. And in total, the combination of these 2 actions provides the company approximately $900 million of liquidity to the bottom line. Second, we also entered into a new $300 million unsecured and undrawn backstop commitment. This facility will be available to draw beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. Securing this facility provides a backstop for the remaining portion of the non-extending operating credit facility, which matures in January 2024. Pro forma for these recent transactions, our liquidity position at year-end is approximately $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $650 million under the available commitment. For housekeeping, this does not include the enhancement to future liquidity, we obtained with the $300 million undrawn commitment as it is currently not available to draw. Before handling the call back -- handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate our relentless focus on executing on our medium- and long-term financial strategy as laid out on Slide 18. We will continue to be opportunistic and are committed to delivering value for all stakeholders. But most of all, we are excited to be back in full operation and once again delivering incredible vacation experiences on our 3 brands to all corners of the globe. With that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments.Frank J. Del RioThank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail &amp; Sustain, which Slide 19 outlines a few key highlights. Since we last spoke, we have made meaningful progress to advance our commitment to pursue net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. We successfully completed the testing of biodiesel fuel blends on 3 additional ships in our fleet, a promising potential lever to help reduce emissions on our existing fleet. In addition, we recently modified our contracts to the final 2 Prima Class ships for Norwegian Cruise Line scheduled for delivery in 2027 and '28 to reconfigure these ships to accommodate green methanol and as an alternative fuel source in the future. While additional modifications will be needed in the future to fully enable the use of dual fuel, both methanol and diesel, this action reinforces our commitment to decarbonization and represents an important and exciting step forward in our pursuit of net zero. Before turning the call over to Q&amp;A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 20. First, we believe we are well positioned in the current economic environment and our target upmarket consumer remains resilient. This is especially true for the all-import North American consumer from we enjoy an outsized benefit, given our strategic sourcing mix and focus on global versus national brands. Second, booking momentum is positive, buoyed by a strong start to the year with wave season, and we are pleased with our book position and pricing for 2023. Third, we are focused on strengthening the foundation for sustained profitable growth, and we will continue to take strategic measures to best position the company for its next era. And lastly, our cash generation engine continues to rev up which, along with our transformational new build pipeline provides a path to meet our liquidity needs and to restore our balance sheet in the coming years. We've covered quite a bit today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Jessica JohnBefore we get to the questions on the line, we first want to address a top question from our online shareholder Q&amp;A platform, which provides all of our investors another avenue to submit and upvote questions from management. The top question this quarter was what are our plans to bring in new customers and also reward brand loyalists to entice them to cruise. Frank, do you want to take that one?Frank J. Del RioSure. I think both past guests and new guests are absolutely critical for our continued growth. We have a great base of loyal guests who love our product because each of our brands have incredibly high repeat rates running anywhere from 45% for the Norwegian brand to as high as 55% for region. And we're always looking for new ways to engage with them, including through our popular loyalty programs that each brand operates. We also have a robust new build pipeline as we just finished discussing. One new build being introduced for each brand this year alone and we all know new ships and above surrounding new ships have historically brought outsized attention to the brand. Just consider the buzz when Katy Perry performed as godmother of Norwegian Prima this past summer. And just recently, Giada De Laurentiis was named godmother of Oceania's upcoming Vista, which highlights the brand's focus on having the fun is to (inaudible) . These announcements create excitement, not just among loyal guests, but also to new brand and even new to cruise guests. You've heard us say many times that the cruise industry as a whole is vastly underpenetrated, and we have significantly -- have a significant runway ahead to attract new to cruise guests, creating awareness, drawing buzz, partnering with a travel agent community and even having investors such as yourselves, deliver the message, of the value and unique experiences that cruises offer is a large part of what we do every single day, and we'll continue to do so to drive that message to as many possible guess as we possibly can.OperatorOur first question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.Daniel Brian PolitzerI wanted to touch first on the balance sheet. Obviously, there's a lot of work that you guys have been doing there. How do you think about leverage this year, next year? And to what extent is your appetite to issue equity relative to debt?Mark A. KempaWell, first and foremost, the discussion of issuing equity is a Board decision. So I will leave it there, but what I can tell you is that, that has not been in discussion in any of our Board meetings. We've said time and time and again, we do not believe that it is prudent to issue more equity to delever the company. As we look forward and we look at our balance sheet, we have said that our internal goal here is we want to turn the year with a 5x handle. And for clarification, that does include an adjustment for the new builds that we take delivery of in this year since we do not have the full earnings potential. But that's what the company has rallied around, and that's what we're focused on. We've said before, it's not an easy task, but we're rallying against that, and that's what we're using as our stake in the sand. So there's a lot of opportunity ahead in the industry and especially for our company for the year. We are in a dynamic environment, all signs that we see are looking good, and that's evidenced by our pricing power and our Q4 results as well as our guidance for the year. But nevertheless, there is some unknowns out there. So we're feeling pretty good right now. We continue on our path of hitting our guidance that we've just issued, and we feel good about our overall liquidity and balance sheet position where it stands today, but there's a lot of work to do.Daniel Brian PolitzerUnderstood. And then just for a follow-up, bookings are obviously positive. You're putting through all these cost efficiencies. Do you have any expectation as bookings progress and you guys continue to recover when you can get back to that $100 EBITDA per APCD level. And also, along with that, if you could just maybe give a little bit more color on the cost efficiencies, total amount, the time that they're going to be achieved? And to what extent there could be further room in coming years?Mark A. KempaGreat. That's a lot to unpack there. So let me start with the EBITDA per capacity day. Look, this is going to take time, right? If we look at where this industry was not so long ago, we -- it was only last May of 2022 where we started operating all of our vessels. So we are progressing. We are hitting our milestones that we've laid out for several quarters now. It is a progression. Bookings are doing well. Onboard revenue spend is trending well, but it will take time. It's not an overnight process. And so as we think about that, part of that is enhancing our revenue, enhancing margins, obviously, and rightsizing our cost base. We've said that our strategy coming out of the pandemic was we wanted to reset the bar on pricing. We believe we've done that, which we believe will be a longer-term benefit for all our constituents. And now we are squarely focused on rightsizing our cost base. As we look to the future, we're on a period of transformational growth. We have almost 50% growth between now and 2028, with our scheduled pipeline of deliveries. So we have to do better, and we are going to do better on leveraging our scale, and that's what we're focused on. So it's going to come from a lot of different places. But we focused on the top line. Now we're squarely focused on the cost, and that's going to translate to improved margins, which again will then translate ultimately into achieving that pre-pandemic EBITDA per capacity day.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.Steven Moyer WieczynskiI want to ask -- Frank, this is probably for you. I want to ask about how you guys think about cutting costs versus balancing the customer experience? And I guess what I'm getting at is we've read out there, you guys have taken some action on board, whether that's cutting things like entertainment or servicing cabins, things like that, which I assume is being done to reduce costs. But do you worry about the customer experience that starts to be impacted and you eventually start to hurt the long-term perception of your product? Just trying to figure out how you balance those 2 things?Frank J. Del RioSteve, it is a balance. Obviously, you don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, which is the customer. We believe that the -- we're trying to balance what customers pay, what they actually pay for and what they receive. So for example, we did not cut the turndown service that you mentioned across all brands or across all cabin categories. It's only in the lower cabin categories that equate to a lower per diem. So look, it's management's responsibility to optimize revenue and minimize costs. That's economics 101, and that's what we're doing.Mark A. KempaSteve, I think the other way to think about it is we're simply aligning ourselves to what others in the hospitality sector have done as well. So this is nothing new. I think customers in today's society are used to getting a different level of service. We're not degrading the product. We're squarely focused on making sure that the guest experience is wholly intact, but we're going to align ourselves to what is the new normal for the hospitality sector. I think it's the right thing to do.Steven Moyer WieczynskiOkay. That makes sense. And then second question, Mark, this is probably going to be for you, and it's kind of a quasi accounting question, which I'm not an expert in. But we've seen you guys also -- at least I think I've seen you guys kind of increase your service fees or your gratuities by a pretty decent amount. And I would assume that some portion of that has to -- does that hit your -- half of it hits your yields and then the other half hit cost? I'm just trying to figure out if you guys could help us think about what that impact is on that yield side? And I guess what I'm trying to get at here is I don't want to -- I'm hoping that expectations for yields don't get too ahead of themselves, if all that kind of makes sense.Mark A. KempaWell, Steve, you're taking a big chance asking me an accounting question, but I think I'm going to go for it. Look, absolutely, when we increase the service fees, it does get rolled up as part of our gross revenue, but there's also a cost to that. And there's obviously some direct cost to that, but there's also the employment costs, which go against that, which hit in our net cruise cost. So service fees, again, the vast majority of that all goes to our dedicated crew and employees, who are working on the ship, but there is a revenue component to it and there is a cost component to it. But again, that's something that's been consistent for us over the years. No change in the accounting or no change in the comparability.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.Conor T. CunninghamJust in terms of the cost initiatives that you're talking about, can you just frame up the buckets and where you're expecting the biggest improvement and maybe like a potential upside there? And then maybe just unpack a little bit about when it's going to hit? I would assume that a lot of it is second half weighted, but if you could just give a little bit more detail, that would be helpful.Mark A. KempaYes, certainly. So on the cost, as I said in my prepared remarks, Q1 will be the highest cost quarter. And then as we look forward sequentially, we expect those costs to decrease each quarter as some of our initiatives gain hold and take place. And I think the way to think about it is as you look toward the back half of 2023, that's going to be a little bit more representative of what our exit rate would be as well on a go-forward basis. There is one thing I want to remind you as well as we are taking on a more -- we have a more pronounced mix effect with the operating capacity that we're bringing online as well. As you guys know, we are bringing on an Oceania class vessel in May of this year and a Regent vessel at the tail end of the year. Those, by default, have a much higher operating cost than the NCLH average. So there is some impact in that overall cost guidance as a result of the mix. So keep that in mind. And then when you think about the overall buckets on the cost, it's everything you can think of. We've said before, we spent a lot on marketing in 2022 going after the customer, creating that demand, elevating pricing. We believe we've been successful there. So we're going to scale start scaling that back. But it's everyday things -- everything we do on our corporate side, on our ship side, whether it's optimizing our supply chain initiatives, optimizing our itineraries, so that we're getting the best fuel consumption. There is no silver bullet in this industry, but it's a lot of little things that can add up and that's what we're squarely focused on going forward.Conor T. CunninghamOkay. And then to follow up maybe on pricing. There's still some -- I mean, you guys still sound great on pricing, but there's still some concerns of weakening consumer overall. So I was just curious if you could unpack your current bookings a little bit? The only reason why I ask is deployments have shifted a little bit, and I don't know if there's been something on the margin that implies weakness somewhere. So any help there would be helpful.Frank J. Del RioYes. This is Frank. We simply don't see any weakness. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen very, very strong record -- new record booking levels dating back to November. And it's our view that as long as consumers have a job and the labor markets remain strong, that they'll continue spending on the things they normally spend their money on, including vacations. So we simply don't see a weakening consumer. If you look at our forward bookings, each quarter in '23 is better booked than the comparable quarter in 2019. And even if you start looking into '24, it's never too early to talk about next year. 2024 bookings are running ahead at higher prices than they were at the same time in 2019 for 2020, which before the pandemic. So we simply haven't seen any indication that the consumer is shying away from taking cruise vacations, at least not with our 3 brands.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.Charles Patrick ScholesGoing back to some comments from last -- I believe last summer and last fall, you had talked about expectations or you seem pretty confident in record EBITDA for this year. However, when I look at the range, certainly at the midpoint and below, if I'm comparing apples-to-apples would not imply a record EBITDA. And then additionally, it looks like if I'm getting this correctly, your expectation since last earnings for bookings are now ahead, I think previously it was in line. Kind of what's changed in how you think about hitting that record EBITDA target as it relates to the guided range? And I hope that makes sense, what I just asked.Mark A. KempaYes. We think we got it. So Patrick, nothing has changed. I think if there's anything we've learned as a management team and society over the last year or 2 is that the we're in a unique environment. On one hand, we have a very strong consumer. We have very strong wage growth and employment. And on the other hand, we have economists telling us that we're -- there's a high chance of recession. So you take your pick. We're -- I like into this is we're in uncharted territory in the world. So nothing has changed. But we think by being -- we want to be conservative. We want to make sure we're hitting putting out reasonable targets, but nothing should be implied from that. We're confident of where we are, but we think a range is the most appropriate way to go at this point, given all the factors in front of the world as a whole.Charles Patrick ScholesOkay. Okay. I just have a couple of, hopefully, quick follow-up questions. Can you just explain again why you dipped into the Apollo financing? It sounded like last summer or last fall, that would not have been the intention at that time, but that's changed. Can you just review with us the rationale there?Mark A. KempaCertainly. So first and foremost, it was $250 million, which when you look at our overall debt structure, it's really minimal. But the most important reason we did that is we wanted flexibility on the facility. And as you recall and if you look in the past, we were getting -- we had 6 months options, we had 8-month options, 12-month options. We wanted a 2-year option. And the price to do that was our counterparty wanted a small draw on the overall facility. So when you look at the totality of that draw, which is relatively minor in the broader scope of our debt, versus having a 2-year flexible backstop, we thought that was the prudent course of action to take at a relatively reasonable cost on the overall facility.Charles Patrick ScholesOkay. And then last one, this question actually might save Mark, you and Jessica a number of callbacks later. Just I do see your share count is going up for the full year to 460 million. Is -- I assume that's from the convert or exchangeable notes converting sometime in the year. Can you just remind us which -- I think it's the May '24 and August '25 and how many if that's correct? And what -- how many shares are added from each of those, if those are the correct ones and roughly at what quarter might you expect that to occur?Mark A. KempaYes, Patrick, I think we'll take some of those details offline on our post call. But what I can tell you is that we've been telegraphing that expect our average fully diluted share count to be approximately about 470 million, which I think believe we have in our slide deck for a couple of calls now. And that assumes that the 2027 convertibles are converted in cash, which we've been saying from the get-go. But it really is just a reflection of where the convertibles, the 2024 and '25 convertibles, which will be equitized. We do not have a choice there, but that is really just the accounting for it. So on average, I would use about 460 million for the fully diluted share count for the year.Charles Patrick ScholesI'll check out the slide deck on that.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research.Frederick Charles WightmanCan you just touch on the plans or changes to the premium class. Sounds like those are going to be a little bit bigger than the first few iterations. I know that you guys were excited about offering a smaller ship size initially when that was introduced. So what exactly changed? Was it the cost, the guest experience, something else?Harry J. SommerYes. This is Harry Sommer. Listen, we were really excited about the performance of Prima. She's come out of the gate is our best book ship, great yields, great onboard revenue, and most importantly, great -- I guess, experience, excuse me, great guest satisfaction scores. When we looked at the platform now that it's in operation, we think we can take that great guest experience, great financial performance and get slightly better economies of scale by driving the ships a little bit bigger, hence, the slight increase for Prima 3 and 4, which will be delivered in '25 and '26. The last 2 is really a combination, as Mark mentioned in the prepared comments, making them methanol ready, which we think is very important for our decarbonization goals over time. We're very excited about the technology. We work with a lot of different experts in the field to hold in on ethanol being the future for ships being built in the later part of the 2020s. But in addition to having to ship larger at the house, the methanol tanks, we're able to get more scale on those as well, more passenger counts. So again, the key is to deliver a fantastic guest experience and see what we can do to leverage scale and become more decarbonized along the way.Frederick Charles WightmanMakes sense. And then just on the marketing spend that you guys had talked about for a while in the back half 2022, could you maybe give some qualitative feedback on whether that met your expectations? Did you get the pricing benefit that you had expected? Was the consumer feedback in line with sort of what you were hoping for when you earmark that spend or not?Frank J. Del RioOur basic go-to-market philosophy as we market to fill, we don't discount to fill throughout the pandemic period and coming out of the pandemic period. Being able to keep our industry-leading net per diems and yields was of utmost importance. We've seen what happened to others when the discounting goes too far, it takes years, if not decades to be able to climb back up that slippery hill. So if marketing was the cost of maintaining our industry-leading yields and it was well worth it. And we turned the year in our best book position ever. Mean to be able to say that at the end of '22, we were better booked than at any time in our history, given what this industry has just gone through, where the full fleet was not in operation until the mid-year is an incredible statement to make and at higher prices. So yes, unquestionably, it was the right strategic decision to make for our company. Now we believe that we've got momentum back. We had to create momentum. The industry was on its knees. We hadn't operated the full fleet in 2 years, 0 revenue for 500 days. So we had to stimulate the market. And you can do it 1 of 2 ways in my estimation, you can discount and you can give away the product or you can market and we choose to market. And now that we've done so and have regained momentum and bookings continue to be strong and we're better booked today than we were a year ago over 2019 at the same period. We think we can now start paring back on that marketing spend. Now at the same time, we're adding 3 new ships and those have to be filled. So on a per capacity day basis, I think marketing costs will come down. On a gross basis, I'm not sure the exact number, maybe Mark knows that number. But on a PCD basis, marketing costs will come down as a result of the dynamics that just laid out.Harry J. SommerAnd this is Harry again. It's not just a theoretical comment. When we look at in the metric that Frank described, marketing costs divided by capacity days sold, which I think is the right metric for marketing, we've seen decreases, material decreases in Q4 versus Q3. So we're already starting to realize that. But as Frank mentioned, we have more capacity days to sell with 3 new ships coming across the brands this year.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Citi.James Lloyd HardimanI just wanted to make sure I understand sort of the trajectory on per diems. Really strong rebound here in the fourth quarter. I think we went from on a net basis from plus 5% to about 14% to 15% growth range versus 2019. I guess as I think about the first quarter, it's going to be up 6.5% and for the year in that 9.5% range. I guess, why the detail, I'm assuming there's some mix involved here, but I know that you're launching an Oceania ship and a Regent ship, which I would think would be accretive to per diems. So maybe just walk us through sort of the undulations of that per diem number.Mark A. KempaJames, it's Mark. So look, I wouldn't classify anything as a deceleration. And I think when you look at our yield growth for the full year, you were spot on 9% to 10.5% pretty strong number given the value proposition of where the cruise industry vis-a-vis the broader vacation market. But when you look at Q1, you go from Q4 to Q1, it's really a mix impact of where our fleet is operating. We have a much higher weighting of exotic itineraries in Q1, which were slightly impacted on the slower restart or the slower opening of the world. So whether it was cruises in Japan or Australia or that area of the world, there was a little bit more hurdles than we anticipated getting those back to operation, and there was a little more hesitation on the consumer. So Q1 was really just impacted by that. I would characterize it as the last normalization quarter, so to speak. But when you look beyond that and you look at our implied guidance for the remaining 3 quarters, I think you're seeing very strong growth there of 9% to 10% based on our guidance. So we're feeling good where the pricing is today.James Lloyd HardimanOkay. And just maybe a point of clarification. You talked for the fourth quarter, you talked about how revenues and net cruise cost ex fuel or in line with your expectations that EBITDA was a bit short. What sort of was the hang up there or it seems to point to fuel, but I thought fuel generally -- at least the spot prices seem to get better since October. So what led to that miss on the EBITDA line?Mark A. KempaYes. It was very slight, James. And it was really just truing up some of our year-end accruals and making sure that going into the year, we were fully stock, so to speak, to ensure that we had no lagging issues affecting our 2023 performance. So nothing material. It was just all items on the margin.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Paul Golding with Macquarie.Paul Alexander GoldingMy first question is around just a comment. I think Mark, you just made around the exotic destination. So could you give us any qualitative background on how the destination mix right now compares to last year given the geopolitical disruptions last year? In other words, from just a Baltics and Eastern Med disruption last year, how the timing of these more exotic higher-yielding destinations line up to fill that gap on a year-over-year basis?Mark A. KempaYes, certainly. So I think when we look at the year overall, we do have more -- we are leading to a more exotic deployment mix. But that's not really concerning to us, because as we cycle through Q1 and we look toward the latter part of third quarter and fourth quarter, we see accelerating demand for those products. We do have more European capacity this year. We have slightly less Caribbean capacity and more Alaska capacity. So overall, we are trending to a, again, a bit more exotic or longer itinerary based deployments, but that's shaping up well for us, absent this what we would call a onetime Q1 anomaly with the overall restart.Frank J. Del RioOkay. We have time for 1 more question, operator.OperatorAnd the final question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.Robin Margaret FarleyI have 2 expense questions. One is you talked about how the exit rate by Q4 for expense would look a little bit more normalized. With the full year kind of up 18% and Q1, up 22%, does that imply the exit rate sort of going forward would still be in kind of the low to mid-teens increase versus 2019? Is that kind of what we should think of as sort of a normalized run rate for you? And then my other expense question is on the $1.3 billion in higher new build CapEx. And I know you talked about upsizing a number of the Prima ships and adding some alternative fuel to 2 of them. It seems like maybe there are some other things contributing to that $1.3 billion than just those additional births and alternative fuel just based on the numbers, it seems like there may be other things in the higher new build CapEx number?Mark A. KempaRobin, I'll take -- I think there was 2 questions in there. So I'll start with the last one, because that's the one I can remember. Regarding new builds, look, the -- we're increasing the size of 4 vessels pretty significantly by, I think, it's more than 10% on 3 and 4 and almost more than 20%. So there is a cost to that. There's -- it's not just adding cabins, it's lengthening the vessels, widening the vessels, but also more importantly, on 5 and 6, we are getting them -- those vessels to be methanol ready. I always say, going green is not free. There is a cost to it, but we think this is a good cost. We think it's the right cost. I would hesitate or caution you to just simply take the additional births and look at it as costing $1.2 billion, because there is a lot of technical aspects behind that in relation to making the vessels bigger. So I would just caution you on that note. And I think the -- your first part of the question was on the exit rate of our costs. I think you're thinking about it correctly, somewhere in the low teens is probably where we would look vis-a-vis 19%, but again, we are squarely focused on. We have to do a better job of leveraging our scale. And I think as we continue to prove that quarter after quarter this year, you're going to see improvements on that front.Frank J. Del RioAs always, thank you, everyone, for your time and support today. We will be available to answer any of your questions throughout the day and we wish you a good day, and please stay safe. Thank you.OperatorAnd this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you, and have a great day.]"

Shares sliding there. The company expecting to lose more in the first quarter than Wall Street had initially anticipated. But Norwegian executives still beating a positive drum about record bookings over the last several months. Here's what CEO Frank Del Rio had to say on the earnings call.FRANK DEL RIO: We simply don't see any weakness. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen very, very strong record-- near-record booking levels dating back to November. And it's our view that as long as consumers have a job and the labor markets remain strong, that they'll continue spending on the things they normally spend their money on, including vacations.SEANA SMITH: So, Dave, Norwegian just the last of the travel names here to really report strong demand. The company also highlighting that in the month of January, a record month for bookings on the cruise lines. We talked time and time again how consumers are strapped right now. They're pulling back on spending. Travel experiences certainly seems to be one of the areas, the main areas, that isn't feeling the effects of that, at least for now.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it's really interesting to start this show talking about Target and how consumers are cutting back on apparel and some of the basics, food. I mean, it's just really surprising to then see Del Rio also talk about 87% load factor in Q4, leading to what he says-- and this is a direct quote-- continuing through the first quarter of '23, as we have already achieved 100% occupancy in the quarter, leading to return to historical levels, historical levels, beginning in the second quarter of '23. They believe capacity will be 19% above pre-pandemic 2019 levels this year.So while investors weren't thrilled with that report, that really comes down to cutting costs, fuel, labor, food. Things like that are really impacting Norwegian. But that demand is not showing any signs of letting up. We thought cruises would really be the laggard in the travel industry. And they were for quite some time because people had that hesitancy to go back, still had some fear built in around COVID. But everything you heard from Frank Del Rio suggests that people are comfortable and are booking cruises. Again, can they sail to profitability in '23? That remains the question because investors really not impressed with this report, despite the demand, which is an interesting surprise.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, and you were mentioning some of those impressive numbers. The revenue per passenger in the cruise, Dave, up 20-- or was 23% higher than it was in the same period in 2019. So pre-pandemic, that comparison there very, very strong. Report here from the company, booking volumes have also accelerated in the recent months. A wave season is what the company attributed that to. Winter holidays, the end of March, certainly a lot of the promotions, demand was there. We'll see whether or not it hangs on.And you and I have had this conversation time and time again, and it's always where it seems to end when it comes to that consumer demand. Yes, right now, they're willing to pay those higher airfare tickets when it comes to some of the airlines they're not willing to pay on the cruise lines. When does that change? And at what point will consumers not be willing to pay those higher prices? I think that's the question everybody is asking at this point.DAVE BRIGGS: I'll tell you just anecdotally, as someone who just returned from a vacation, same spot in Mexico I've been going to for more than 10 years, I have never seen this place 20% as crowded as it was over the past week. Easily 75, 80, if not 100% more packed, every single destination I ever went to-- restaurants, bars, markets. Never seen the hunger for travel anything like it was.What I had to do is talk to some of these people, and I don't think it's really-- people always tell us, these CEOs, about the shift in spending from goods to services. It really is a priority change, coming out of COVID. And talking to some of the people on my packed flights to and from Mexico, they've just changed their priorities in terms of how they spend. They believe they need to spend that money on experiences. And that, I think, is what COVID really changed in the consumer is how they want to experience life. And they are willing to fork over some bucks. But nonetheless, Norwegian hammered on that Q4 report. Need to sail to profitability in the months ahead.SEANA SMITH: They certainly do. That is what the Street wants.]"

For the full year 2022, revenue amounted to $4.8 billion, down from $6.5 billion in 2019. Onboard spending was a bright spot. Revenue per passenger per cruise day was up 25 percent higher than in the comparable period in 2019. Norwegian served around a total of 1.7 million guests in 2022.In the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $1.52 billion, up from $1.48 billion for the same period in 2019. Total revenue per passenger cruise day rose 23 percent year over year. Occupancy rose 87 percent quarter over quarter.Heading into 2023, booking volume looks strong. January of this year was a record for the company even though pricing was higher than in 2019. Occupancy is expected to average around 100 percent for the first quarter and is on track to reach historical levels. The cruise company expects booking levels to stay strong in the year ahead as long as the job market remains strong, said Cruise President and CEO Frank J. Del Rio.With demand now surging, the company is cutting back on costs by 15 percent across the business to maximize profitability for the year ahead.  Marketing spend, which rose in 2022 to win back guests, will be scaled back. “We’ve said before, we spent a lot on marketing in 2022 going after the customer, creating that demand, elevating pricing,” said Norwegian Cruise Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Kempa. “We believe we’ve been successful there.”The company will also be cutting back on some of its offerings. Norwegian, for example, will cut the turndown service on its lower cabin categories. “We’re not degrading the product. We’re squarely focused on making sure that the guest experience is wholly intact, but we’re going to align ourselves to what is the new normal for the hospitality sector,” said Kempa. “I think it’s the right thing to do.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

We'll use ROE to examine MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for MetLife How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for MetLife is:9.4% = US$2.6b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.09 in profit.Does MetLife Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that MetLife has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Insurance industry average (11%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for MetLife.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesMetLife's Debt And Its 9.4% ROEIt appears that MetLife makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 3.70. We consider it to be a negative sign when a company has a rather low ROE despite a rather high debt to equity.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: MetLife may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

PMI data also showed manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest rate in over a decade, reinforcing expectations of a strong economic rebound in the world’s largest oil importer.China’s oil demand is seen as the chief factor behind expectations for higher oil prices later in the year. A recent Reuters poll among economists showed most expect Brent crude to top $90 per barrel in the second half of the year. The respondents cited Chinese demand and Russian supply as factors.The China demand expectations were so pronounced this week that they offset the American Petroleum Institute’s estimate that crude oil inventories in the United States had expanded for yet another week. According to the API, the build came in at 6.2 million barrels.Government data on U.S. inventories from the Energy Information Administration is out later today but the EIA, too, has been reporting sizeable inventory builds over the past several weeks.The U.S. inventory reports have capped oil price gains to an extent lately, and OPEC production data may add to that cap.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled up 64 cents, or 0.8%, to $77.69.U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.2 million barrels last week to 480.2 million barrels last week to the highest since May 2021, government data showed, beating analyst expectations of a 457,000-barrel rise.

The province also produces more than 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in a year.But growth is expected to moderate this year with central banks raising rates to cool inflation, putting downward pressure on oil and gas prices. As a result, the surplus is expected to be just C$2.4 billion for the fiscal year that begins April 1, down from C$10.4 billion in the current year, according to Finance Minister Travis Toews’ new budget.The decline will happen as West Texas Intermediate is expected to average $79 a barrel, $11.50 a barrel less than in the current fiscal year.

The reading was boosted by bigger-than-expected rises in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs.The data indicates that an economic recovery in the world’s largest oil importer is gaining steam after it relaxed most anti-COVID measures earlier this year.Brent oil futures rose 0.9% to $83.81 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.4% to $77.38 a barrel by 21:26 ET (02:26 GMT). Both contracts extended gains into a second straight session.The strong Chinese data fed into bets that a recovery in the Asian giant will drive oil demand to record highs in 2023. This notion also supported oil prices in recent sessions, with prices rallying as much as 2% on Tuesday.The data also helped markets look past a softer-than-expected economic growth reading from major crude importer India.On the supply side, industry data showed that U.S. oil inventories likely grew for a 10th consecutive week, pointing to a supply glut in the world’s largest oil consumer.Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude inventories grew by a far bigger-than-expected 6.2 million barrels in the week to Feb 24, heralding a similar rise in government data due later in the day.The reading, coupled with signs of slowing U.S. gasoline demand, indicates that crude consumption in the world's largest oil consumer remains under pressure, as the country grapples with high inflation and rising interest rates.Concerns that this trend- particularly rising interest rates- could dent economic growth and in turn crude demand, have hounded oil prices in recent sessions. Markets also fear that a recession in the rest of the globe could largely offset a demand rebound in China.Story continuesFocus this week is now on U.S. business activity indicators for February, due on Wednesday and Friday. Manufacturing activity is expected to have contracted, offsetting strength in the services sector.Economic indicators from around the globe, including Eurozone PMIs and consumer inflation, are also due this week, and are expected to provide more cues on the global economy.Related ArticlesOil prices rise as China optimism offsets rising U.S. inventoriesExclusive-Biden administration to move on Midwest ethanol-blended gasoline rule this week -sourcesGold prices edge down after rebounding from 2023 lows]"

At the tech giant, ohana means family, and family means no one gets left behind—except for the several thousand people the company laid off earlier this year as it faced stiff economic headwinds.More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash? Consider a checking account bonusThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 homeOn February 13, after the second round of layoffs in 2023, Benioff shared his annual forward-looking strategy planning document in a company-wide Slack channel. The document digs into the details of Benioff’s long-heralded management process he calls V2MOM, which stands for vision, values, methods, obstacles, and measures.“What I like about the V2MOM is that it encourages creativity, change, and empowerment,” Benioff wrote in 2020. “Different team members can lead different methods, and they update the V2MOM as the year progresses. We think of the V2MOM as a living and breathing document.”Living and breathing may be apt descriptions for the “Obstacles” section of this year’s document—and some Salesforce employees might add “rage-inducing.” What was intended to explain reasons for the company’s performance challenges instead led to outrage among some of its employees.“Reductions in Force could be a distraction to a productivity environment,” a section on the Obstacles page, obtained by Fortune, reads. “Wellness culture overpowered high performance culture during pandemic. Fear of escalations for people-related issues (burnout, psychological safety, equality, etc.) can make managers reticent to performance manage their teams.”The document quickly received employee blowback, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. One worker wrote on Slack the line about wellness culture was “most disturbing and tone deaf” and “a sad excuse,” according to the Journal. On February 20, Benioff sent out a revised document with that line removed.Story continuesRepresentatives for Salesforce and for Benioff did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.It’s not the first time Benioff opined, to workers’ chagrin, about the productivity shift he thinks accompanied the pandemic. In December, he wrote in the #all-salesforce Slack channel, which at the time contained 86,000 members, that employees hired during the pandemic in 2021 and 2022 were “especially facing much lower productivity.”He went on to ask a few questions in an effort to solicit feedback—“Is this a reflection of our office policy? Are our managers not directly addressing productivity with their teams?”—which one employee told Fortune was “extraordinarily peculiar” because the company, just weeks prior, ended its pandemic-era benefit of one Friday off per month.“The quality of your business is the quality of your questions,” Benioff said in a message to Fortune at the time. “Asking hard questions of employees (and customers) for their answers is one of the effective ways to get answers as a business leader today. It’s why we bought Slack because there is no better way to ask questions and crowd source answers quickly. Already today I have almost 500 replies to my question—amazing and incredibly useful as the CEO of Salesforce.”Defining wellness, culture, and high performance It’s difficult to hone in on what “culture” looks like at a company as vast as Salesforce, which boasts a $163.6 billion market cap and employs over 70,000 workers. But clues indicate many employees aren’t happy.Consider the issues at Slack, which Salesforce acquired in 2021 for nearly $28 billion. The messaging app has long made clear its priorities of flexible work, mental health and work-life balance.In an internal Q&amp;A with Slack’s senior leadership team in January, outgoing CEO Stewart Butterfield discussed the workplace messaging app’s cultural rift with Salesforce, which acquired it in 2021.Butterfield admitted he “wasn’t very successful” in integrating the two cultures, per an audio recording of the meeting Fortune obtained. “The problem has been, there’s no incorporation of the Slack culture into the Salesforce culture, and unless there is some element of that, then it’s not integration in any sense. It’s just the elimination.”Research has shown that wellness culture and high performance culture don’t exist at odds with one another. Rather, the companies that have experienced sustained success throughout the pandemic balanced business needs with employee health needs.According to the latest Pulse survey from Slack’s Future Forum, workers with flexible work arrangements were 57% more likely than fully in-person workers to say their company culture has improved since that flexible policy was implemented.“Executives say, ‘Because I grew up in a certain way and have certain experiences of workplace culture, I feel uncomfortable doing other things…going forward,’” Brian Elliott, executive leader of Future Forum, told Fortune. “Executives are worried about retaining culture with flexible work, but our data shows a completely different story.“It really comes down to trust at the end of the day—give people the flexibility to work where and when they’re at their best,” Elliott continued. The survey also found that concerns like Benioff’s about declining productivity are unfounded. When compared with workers who have no ability to shift their schedules, respondents with full schedule flexibility reported 39% higher productivity and 64% greater ability to focus.The most productive, focused workers are those who don’t feel overworked. Fifty-three percent of workers dissatisfied with their company’s flexibility reported burnout, compared with just 37% among workers who are satisfied.“If you’re an executive worried about productivity, stop sweating how many days people are coming in and start sweating the meetings running amok in your organization,” Elliott said.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash?

If you want to skip the investment philosophy of Ken Fisher and the detailed analysis of Fisher Asset Management, go directly to Ken Fisher's 5 New Purchases/Additions.Ken Fisher, the founder, executive chairman and co-chief investment officer of Fisher Asset Management, predicts that the market conditions in 2023 will resemble those of 1967, as outlined in an article posted in the New York Post. In 1966, inflation was high, there were concerns about a possible recession, and the US Federal Reserve was increasing benchmark interest rates to counter inflation. The S&amp;P 500 Index experienced a 22% decline that year, similar to the 2022 market conditions. However, the market recovered in the fourth quarter of 1966, with a 6% gain, and recorded a YoY rise of 24% in 1967. The current market has also staged a comeback, with a 7.2% gain since October 2022.In one of the interviews, Ken Fisher suggested that investors can position their portfolio to benefit from a new bull market bounce by investing in categories that have dropped the most during the bear market. He said that we are currently in the early stages of a new bull market that began in October 2022 and expects sectors that were hurt the most last year, such as information technology and other growth-oriented sectors, to perform well in the first part of this new bull market. Ken Fisher also noted that sectors and categories that did well during the recent bear market, such as energy, tend to underperform during the initial bull market bounce, which may seem counterintuitive to some investors. Ken Fisher's 15 New Purchases/AdditionsRegardless of whether a new bull market is already underway or not, Ken advised investors to expect the market to bounce in the near future and suggests investing in categories that suffered the most during the downturn as a way to benefit during a market recovery.Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management 13F portfolio value also increased from $133.41 billion in Q3 to $147.93 billion in Q4 2022. The fund made 145 new purchases in the fourth quarter, additional purchases in 440 stocks, sold out 168 equities, and reduced holdings in 389 stocks. Some of the popular companies in which Ken Fisher made additional/new purchases in his Q4 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we focused on the top 100 positions and identified the biggest additions/purchases in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Although sales were slightly better than expected, Target saw a slowdown in discretionary sales. Gross margins were below expectations with higher markdowns, increased shrink, and incremental costs. Long-term, we expect Target to be able to return to operating margins in the 6% to 8% range as inventories return to normal levels as well as seeing a normalization in supply chain costs.”13. Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 8%Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) produces and distributes industrial items and equipment worldwide. The firm also enjoys a wide range of competitive advantages supporting long-term EPS growth and sustainable earnings. Among these are Illinois Tool Works Inc.

Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 8%Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) provides a variety of business and retail banking, credit card, and other financial services. With over 100 million clients, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is a major participant in the credit card industry. In the past, the corporation has targeted customers with less-than-ideal credit ratings with its offers. What is shockingly obscure, though, is that Capital One is one of the largest full-fledged banks in the country, in addition to being the principal lender behind its cards. It presently holds assets worth close to $400 billion and loans totaling more than $300 billion.Securities filings for the third quarter of 2015 reveal that Ken Fisher added Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) to his portfolio by acquiring 7,189 shares worth $521,000. In the fourth quarter of 2022, he increased his stake in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by 8%, and his 0.58% stake in the company is now worth about $870.33 million.Based on 6 buy ratings, 6 hold ratings, and 3 sell recommendations, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has a consensus rating of ‘Hold.’ Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)’s largest investor is Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates, which owns 12.60 million shares of the company.Here is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Additionally, we initiated a position in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) during the quarter. Capital One is one of the largest issuers of Visa and Mastercard credit cards in the U.S. The company also has a banking network, offers auto and home loans, and manages assets for institutional and high-net-worth clients. We like that Capital One possesses a strong capital position and a common equity tier-1 ratio that exceeds both regulators’ requirements as well as the company’s own internal target. We appreciate the company’s good underwriting track record and its history of lower than expected loss rates given its business mix and yield. In our view, Capital One’s management team is focused on the long term as evidenced by its consistent reinvestment in technology development, and its online/branch bank provides a stable deposit base with decent funding cost. At roughly 5x 2022 consensus earnings and 1.1x tangible book value per share, the stock trades at a significant discount to the market and our estimate of intrinsic value.”]11. Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) creates, produces, commissions, and retrofits building systems and products internationally and in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI)’s largest investor is Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns 5.72 million shares that are worth $366.07 billion.Johnson Controls' price target was increased by Mizuho analyst Brett Linzey on January 13 from $72 to $78 while retaining a ‘Buy’ rating for the stock.

Once a multi-industrial corporation, the company successfully turned itself into a pure-play buildings solutions and technology provider. Catalysts we previously identified for Johnson Controls included synergies following its merger with Tyco International, which provides fire safety and building security products, as well as benefits from its separation of non-building-focused businesses, such as automotive seating and batteries. With all catalysts in sight now nearing completion, and Johnson Controls now a better business for it – with higher recurring revenues and lower capital intensity – we decided to exit our investment to help fund the purchases of Xcel Energy and Atmos Energy.”10. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) offers cloud-based solutions for defining, structuring, administering, and automating enterprise services throughout North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, and other regions. SCGE Management, with 935,100 shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management bought  108,079 more shares of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in Q4. This amount represents a 9% increase over Fisher holdings in ServiceNow relative to the prior three-month period. According to the diversified holding company's 13F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Fisher Asset Management initially took a stake in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in the second quarter of 2014.In the last quarter, the company had 1,637 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract revenue. In addition, ServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) to $510 from $500 on January 26 and maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares following its Q4 earnings beat. The business produced great software outputs and suggestions in a difficult situation, the analyst claimed in a research report.Polen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”9. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a bank and financial holding corporation that provides banking and nonbank financial services. Bank of America has a 'Moderate Buy' consensus rating based on 7 buy recommendations, 5 hold ratings, and 2 sell ratings.In Q4 of 2022, Fisher Asset Management ramped its stake in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock by 9%.

Furthermore, the bank's net interest income increased by 29% yearly in the fourth quarter. Legendary investor and billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), as of the end of the fourth quarter. Here is what Ariel Investment said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“We initiated three new positions in the quarter. We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 10%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the world's largest provider of CRM software and one of the stocks in which Fisher Asset Management has increased its holdings.

(NYSE:CRM).On February 15, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow boosted his price objective on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) from $180 to $195 while maintaining an ‘Overweight’ rating on the stock. According to the analyst, finding interesting stories in software for Q4 earnings would be challenging.Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”7. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 11%Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is a significant household and personal care product manufacturer.

The fund owns more than 5.46 million shares of stock, which are worth $275.06 billion.Here is what Fundsmith said about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) in its 2022 yearly investor letter:“Last year I wrote about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) and attracted a virtual tsunami of comment for my remarks about Unilever, purpose and Hellmann’s mayonnaise. Events soon overtook this commentary insofar as Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners announced that it had bought a stake in Unilever and he was invited to join the board. We are asked to suspend disbelief that this was in no way linked to the subsequent announcement that Alan Jope will be leaving the CEO role. This explanation sounds like it was lifted from the script of Miracle on 34th Street.…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

Investors believe the Federal Reserve will raise rates again at their meetings in March and May, with most agreeing that a quarter percentage point increase at both meetings is most likely. The benchmark rate is expected to reach above 5.1% by the end of the summer.Investors want more clarity on how long the Fed intends to hold rates at elevated levels before it starts to shift them lower again.The belief that rate hikes would soon be over helped lift growth stocks from their funk at the start of the year, but hotter-than-expected economic data on the labor market and core inflation has restoked fears that the end is not in sight. On Wednesday more data on manufacturing activity for February will become available, with analysts expecting a slight tick higher.Data on jobs for February won't be out for another week, however. And that is a key report the Fed will be looking at closely as it heads into its next meeting later in March.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1.

But the main focus will be how far management is willing to go to cut costs and satisfy the demands coming from activist investors.Most Read from BloombergHolding Cash Will Be a Winning Strategy in 2023, Investors SayTesla Slashes Model S and X Prices for the Second Time This YearWorld’s Riskiest Markets Stumble Into Crisis With Dollars ScarceMortgage Lenders Are Selling Homebuyers a LieCredit Suisse Loses One of Its Biggest BackersPressure has been mounting on Salesforce Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff to boost profits after a half-decade of fast hiring and large acquisitions. Five activist investors — Elliott Investment Management, Starboard Value, ValueAct Capital Management, Jeff Ubben’s Inclusive Capital and Dan Loeb’s Third Point — have taken stakes in the company in recent months. Fiscal fourth-quarter results will be management’s first opportunity to address investors since the emergence of these activists.The company’s stock has rallied 23% this year, recovering the losses incurred after co-Chief Executive Officer Bret Taylor and Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield unexpectedly gave notice. They announced plans within a week of each other in late November and early December to leave San Francisco-based Salesforce. Activist involvement in the company has likely been the primary driver of the share gains, wrote Guggenheim Securities analyst John DiFucci.Investors will be “laser focused on Benioff’s comments and plan outlined next week on the conference call” as the company tries to reduce costs and resuscitate growth, wrote Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. “Street frustration is not going to be satisfied with the standard cookie-cutter conference call and view into FY24.”For the first time, the full-year operating margin forecast will be the main attraction rather than revenue. Investors want to see how quickly the company can pare back spending and improve margins. Before the emergence of the activists, Salesforce set a 25% operating margin target for fiscal year 2026. Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin thinks the company could hit that target two years early. Investor pressure has likely “led to changes in Salesforce’s operating philosophy,” wrote BMO’s Keith Bachman, who also raised his margin forecast.Story continuesAs part of the cost-cutting push, the company is also paring back its real estate. At least a dozen offices inherited in megadeals for Tableau and Slack will be closed, including those former companies’ onetime headquarters in Seattle and San Francisco, respectively. “We are bringing all Salesforce employees together under one roof in hub cities,” a company spokesperson said in a Feb. 13 statement about the office shutdowns.It’s been a tumultuous few months for the software firm — it has swapped board directors, axed 8,000 workers and lost numerous top executives. That includes Taylor, who was thought to be the heir-apparent to Benioff. Many analysts expect these disruptions to weigh on revenue and employee morale in the near term.Still, the earnings report could be an “inflection point” toward better margins and growth re-acceleration once macroeconomic and restructuring woes ease, wrote Kash Rangan, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYellowstone Backers Wanted to Cash Out—Then the Streaming Bubble BurstFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB SecretsFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the ExitsHow Countries Leading on Early Years of Child Care Get It RightMicrosoft Expands Game Pass as Regulators Fret Over Activision Deal©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The inflation is turning out to be more “sticky” than expected. This has increased the chances that the Federal Reserve will continue raising the interest rates and then keep the rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.Higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in the latter part of 2023. This has resulted in bearish investor sentiments. Under such a scenario, it is difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns.One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like State Street Corporation STT, Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. UVE and Ralph Lauren Corporation RL are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They precisely assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Selecting the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help you in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (Four Weeks) of 1% or More: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price Greater Than $5: The stocks must trade above $5.Average 20-Day Volume Greater Than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank Equal to #1 or 2: Despite good or bad market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven record of success.

69,385f3403-ff96-3a31-bf03-0bb810b3706a,MCO,2023-03-01,10 Best Stocks to Buy for Good Returns,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-buy-good-142728702.html,1677594448,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'HPQ', 'MCO', 'KHC', 'OXY', '^GSPC', 'CVX', 'ATVI', 'AAPL']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best stocks to buy for good returns. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Stocks to Buy for Good Returns. Stock investing is a rather daunting experience if one chooses to conduct their own research instead of investing in indexes or exchange traded funds. Determining whether a company's share price has the right combination of investor sentiment and strong fundamentals is a tricky process that has entire courses dedicated to it. Every day, Wall Street analysts pump out hundreds of research reports for firms that they believe can either perform well or are to be avoided.In the midst of all this, a safe approach is to follow the gurus. And speaking of gurus, there's no one better than the legendary Warren Buffett when it comes to stock picking. Mr. Buffet is a billionaire investor who runs the holding company Berkshire Hathaway with his long time friend and business partner Mr. Charlie Munger. According to Forbes Magazine, he is the fifth richest person in the world as of February 2023, with an absolutely unfathomable net worth of $107 billion. For perspective, only 25 central banks in the world have higher foreign exchange reserves than Mr. Buffett's wealth, with the Oracle of Omaha going strong and having more wealth than the reserves of both the Republic of Australia and Canada.Looking at this, one has to wonder what has made Mr. Buffet the world's richest financial professional. Well, Insider Monkey has researched this and discovered that Mr. Buffett beat the market only a year after he set up his investment firm. The fund was set up in 1956, and a year later, the S&amp;P500 index would return investors a negative 10.8%. However, those who had trusted the oracle with their money would see a fantastic 10.4% positive return. The rest, as they say, is history.1957 wouldn't be the only year that Mr. Buffett excelled. After all, you don't get called an 'oracle' for nothing. In the ten years between 1957 and 1966, the S&amp;P 500 index would generate a 9.2% return. Impressive, right? Not quite so, as during the same time period, Mr. Buffet would shame the S&amp;P 500 by returning 23.5%. In short, for Warren Buffett vs the S&amp;P 500, it was 2:0. The 23.5% return came after the oracle took his cut of the return by pocketing 5.5% as his investment fees.Story continuesSo, what does the comparison between Mr. Buffett and the S&amp;P500 teach us? It's that when it comes to returns, the oracle does not play in the single digit percentage arena. It's either double digits or nothing - and that's saying something in today's turbulent stock market that has sapped investor confidence and bled market valuations dry as the world deals with one crisis or the other. For reference, a 20% annual return effectively doubles your money in less than four years.Mr. Buffett also has some advice on how to achieve these returns. In Warren Buffett Speaks, the oracle was quoted saying:You don’t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with a 160 IQ always beats the guy with a 130 IQ. Rationality is essential. You need a stable personality.But instead of investing in Mr. Buffett's stocks, what if you invested in his firm? Well, prepare to be surprised, as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)'s shares, which are currently the most expensive stock in America, trade at $467,272. Or, for a Berkshire share, you could also buy a house. But a house wouldn't give you sweet, sweet returns, as from 1983 until today, the share price has appreciated by a whopping 56,209%! Mr. Buffett's old rival, the S&amp;P 500 index, has returned 2,624% over the same time period.Reminding his investors of the bigger picture, Mr. Buffett shared in an investor letter that even though his company does not account for its investee's income as earnings on its books, it still benefits from their performance. According to him:As I’ve emphasized many times, Charlie and I view Berkshire’s holdings of marketable stocks – at yearend worth $281 billion – as a collection of businesses. We don’t control the operations of those companies, but we do share proportionately in their long-term prosperity. From an accounting standpoint, however, our portion of their earnings is not included in Berkshire’s income. Instead, only what these investees pay us in dividends is recorded on our books. Under GAAP, the huge sums that investees retain on our behalf become invisible. What’s out of sight, however, should not be out of mind: Those unrecorded retained earnings are usually building value – lots of value – for Berkshire. Investees use the withheld funds to expand their business, make acquisitions, pay off debt and, often, to repurchase their stock (an act that increases our share of their future earnings). As we pointed out in these pages last year, retained earnings have propelled American business throughout our country’s history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions of shareholders as well.Therefore, it's clear that investing in the stocks that Mr. Buffett has should produce favorable results. Some of his favorite investments are Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).10 Best Stocks to Buy for Good ReturnsOur Methodology We took a look at the oracle's crystal ball, a.k.a.

ALGN has been gaining from the growing market adoption of the iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system. The company’s strategic alliances also buoy optimism. However, economic uncertainty and stiff competition raise apprehension over the company.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 39.2% compared with the 8.2% decline of the industry and a 9.3% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $23.55 billion. The company’s expected long-term earnings growth of 16%, ahead of the industry’s 11.5% rise.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversiTero in Focus: Align Technology has been focusing on expanding the workflow options of its leading iTero scanners. In the fourth quarter, Systems and Services revenues increased sequentially, driven by growth in the Americas and EMEA regions, reflecting continued sales of intraoral scanners, especially the iTero 5D. The company also announced a strategic collaboration with Desktop Metal to supply iTero Element Flex scanners to Desktop Labs. The iTero Element Flex is now the preferred restorative scanner for Desktop Labs and will connect dentists directly with a suite of offerings from Desktop Labs.According to the company, the use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization.Strategic Alliances: Align Technology's slew of strategic alliances looks impressive. In its fourth-quarter 2022, Align Technology collaborated with Desktop Metal to supply iTero Element Flex scanners to Desktop Labs, one of the largest lab networks in the United States, serving GP dentists. Earlier to that, the company partnered with Asana, a work management platform for teams. The partnership aims to offer Invisalign-trained doctors in the United States a new workflow solution, Asana Smiles for Align. The company also noted a DSO partnership with dentalcorp —  Canada's largest and fastest-growing network of dental practices.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInvisalign Holds Potential: Align Technology’s Invisalign Clear Aligner has been receiving positive feedback and holds huge long-term market potential. The global Clear Aligners market size was valued at $2.31 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $5.58 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 18.7% (a Fortune Business Insight report).During the fourth quarter, For the Americas, Q4 Clear Aligner volumes improved in adult patients from the GP dentist channel. For EMEA, Q4 Clear Aligner volume increased sequentially in all markets and across products, especially banking on the strong performance of the recently-launched Invisalign Moderate, iGO Plus and iGO Express. In APAC, outside of China, Q4 Clear Aligner volumes increased sequentially, led by Japan, Taiwan, India and Southeast Asia markets. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner case volumes reflected increased shipments led by Korea, India, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam.DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: Align Technology faces significant competition from traditional orthodontic appliance (or wires and brackets) players such as 3M’s Unitek, Danaher Corporation’s Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply International. The company also competes with products similar to Invisalign Technology, such as the products from Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties.Economic Uncertainty: The general slowdown in the United States and certain international economies is having a negative impact on consumer spending and affecting Align Technology’s business fundamentals. Align Technology attributed the waning earnings to the macroeconomic crisis that affected the overall dental market and led to continued soft dental sales for Align Technology. Dental procedures are primarily elective in nature and are deferred when unemployment levels rise.Estimate TrendIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Align Technology’s 2023 earnings has moved 0.3% north to $9.78.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.76 billion, suggesting a 0.8% surge from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome other better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector include Haemonetics Corporation HAE , TerrAscend Corp.

Overall, the data shows that healthcare workers feel safe in their respective medical environments, but are grappling with safety issues that have dominated headlines in recent years. Those that have healthcare professionals most concerned include: patients becoming violent (72%), the impacts of burnout/mental health (61%) and active assailants (42%). Healthcare employees also provided insights on their preferred communication methods for when safety issues do arise in facilities or in patients’ homes.""Healthcare workers have been through a lot over the past few years.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the fourth quarter, the fund declined 4.54% (Institutional Shares) compared to a 2.31% return for the Russell 3000 Growth Index and a 7.56% return for the S&amp;P 500 Index. For the one-year period, the fund fell sharply trailing both indexes. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Baron Opportunity Fund highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the Q4 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops, and licenses software, services, devices, and solutions. On February 28, 2023, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $249.42 per share. One-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was -1.32%, and its shares lost 16.91% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a market capitalization of $1.857 trillion.Baron Opportunity Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:""Shares of mega-cap software company Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) outperformed despite a mixed fiscal first quarter due to macro challenges that negatively impacted results and guidance, including foreign exchange headwinds, weakening PC demand, and a cyclical slowdown in advertising spending. Total revenue beat Street expectations at 16% constant-currency growth (vs. estimates of 14%), but its Azure cloud computing business missed analyst projections by 1% for the second straight quarter, though it still grew a robust 42% year-over-year, as Microsoft helped its customers optimize existing workloads due to the macro backdrop. While the optimization of workloads is a short-term headwind, we believe it is the right thing to do and should help drive more consumption with customers over time. Our research continues to indicate that the longer-term secular trend of cloud computing remains healthy and intact. For example, in its fourth quarter CIO survey report, Morgan Stanley showed, among other things, that cloud computing was the second highest CIO spending priority (behind only security software), that cloud application workloads were expected to increase from 27% of total workloads today to 46% by the end of 2025, and that Azure was listed as the preferred cloud vendor and likely to take share over the short and long term.9 Additionally, Microsoft is positioned to be a prime beneficiary of ChatGPT. Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2020 and is rumored to be considering investing an additional $10 billion for a 49% stake in the company. Moreover, ChatGPT runs on Microsoft’s Azure platform, and Microsoft recently announced the general availability of its Azure OpenAI Service enabling Azure customers to access advanced AI models, including ChatGPT itself soon. We remain bullish on Microsoft’s long-term opportunity in the cloud, and believe AI has the potential to be additive to growth for years to come.""Story continuesPixabay/Public DomainMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) holds the first position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Consider a checking account bonusThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 homeInsights from Microsoft’s Economic Guardians of the Future report show finance teams are going through an evolution and must strike the right balance between strategic innovation and protecting the long-term health of their company. Eighty percent of finance leaders believe that they and their teams are being challenged more than ever to add value beyond their standard roles and responsibilities. This shift has been driven in part by the uncertain economic climate, marked by factors such as inflation, recession, and international conflicts.Finance teams are being asked to provide insight into the economic future, putting a strain on their resources, and shifting their role from finance professionals to fortune-tellers. Over the next few years, this evolution will take many shapes.From gatekeeper to innovation driverFinance teams are being pulled in two directions: They must accelerate the pace of innovation, while also ensuring brand trust and mitigating risks. They must reduce costs and increase growth to deliver short-term profit, as well as long-term vision and corporate purpose.Despite their reputation as risk-averse, 79% of finance leaders believe that to meet future needs they must play a significant role in owning business innovation and empowering transformation across the organization. Now more than ever, finance teams are focused on transformation, innovation, and the future. Our report found that 86% of finance leaders feel it’s important for senior leadership to formalize the shift of the finance team's role to include strategic innovations that drive company growth.Story continuesHowever, this shift is not without its challenges. The same study revealed that 88% of finance leaders believe that being perceived as a barrier to innovation by other parts of the organization is a significant challenge. To overcome it, finance teams must find ways to demonstrate their value and expertise, and to become more involved in the innovation process.Empower employees with A.I. and automationWhile finance teams are being asked to take on more than ever, they are not seeing incremental increases in people resourcing. Striking the balance between automation and an organization’s most important asset—its people—is key for the future of finance.​ Doing more with less isn’t about overburdening an already taxed workforce, it’s about augmenting human capabilities with automation, enabling employees to move the business forward.​Eighty-two percent of finance leaders found A.I. and automation very important in helping evolve their team’s role to support their organization’s strategic goals. Empowering teams to be ""citizen developers"" and leveraging low- or no-code technologies can help overcome organizational barriers and expand the capabilities of finance teams. The good news is that these tools are now more affordable than ever, making it easier for finance teams to drive innovation and add value to the organization.As finance professionals seek more ways to work smarter, not harder, low-code automation tools remove IT barriers. Empowered with automation and A.I., people are more connected, collaborative, and ready to tackle strategic work.Foster employee fulfillment with innovative tools, culture, and collaborationIt comes as no surprise that employees want to spend less time on repetitive and transactional tasks, and more time working as a team to drive better business decisions. As its role evolves, finance is being called upon to play a key part in fostering a culture of innovation.At Microsoft, we’ve been on this journey for years, transforming our finance operations using our cloud-based products, but this goes beyond technology. We are reimagining what is possible, and that requires a cultural shift to reevaluate our processes, alleviate pain points, foster a culture of learning and innovation, and empower our people to do their best work. We have many citizen-developers on our finance team who are leveraging low-code technology to transform business processes. These initiatives have saved us over 977 hours of manual labor annually, with over $25 million in savings and a huge boost in productivity.We are living through a period of historic economic, societal, and technological change, but for all the uncertainty we continue to see in the world, one thing is clear: Business leaders are turning to finance and innovative technology to help them do more with less, navigate the unexpected, and emerge much stronger.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.15 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on March 30, 2023.WBA has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.6%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.15 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11.WBA is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Tractor Supply (TSCO) as well.Tractor Supply is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 20, 2023.

New Starbucks line a curiosity in Italy,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/olive-oil-coffee-starbucks-line-072500426.html,1677655500,STORY,['SBUX'],"[MILAN (AP) — Putting olive oil in coffee is hardly a tradition in Italy, but that didn't stop Starbucks interim CEO Howard Schultz from launching a series of beverages that do just that in Milan, the city that inspired his coffee house empire.The coffee-olive oil concoction — echoing a keto-inspired trend of adding butter to coffee, only with a sugary twist — has provoked both amusement and curiosity among Italians.Gambero Rosso, an Italian food and wine magazine, called the mixing of olive oil with coffee “a curious combination” but said it was reserving judgment, having not yet sampled the drinks.It did praise featuring the staple of Italian kitchens as a main ingredient, not just a condiment. The magazine also noted the health benefits of consuming extra virgin olive oil, which some Italians do habitually straight from the bottle.""Did we need coffee with extra virgin olive oil and syrups? Maybe yes, maybe no,"" wrote the magazine's Michela Becchi. But the chance to promote Italian excellence is a valuable one, she added.Italy's olive oil producers' association, ASSITOL, welcomed “the daring innovation,"" saying the line of drinks could ”relaunch the image of olive oil, especially among young people.'' The association has been promoting adding olive oil to cocktails.Martina Lunardi, a student of cultural mediation, was sticking to her standard cappuccino on a recent Starbucks visit but said she wasn’t offended by the olive oil combos and might even try one someday.“Anyway, I know where to get a regular cup of coffee,” Lunardi said.Schultz came up with the notion of adding olive oil to coffee after visiting an olive oil producer in Sicily and teased the idea as a game-changer in his last earnings call. He worked with an in-house coffee drink developer to come up with recipes, the international coffee chain said.Schultz presided over the launch of “Oleato” — meaning “oiled” in Italian — last week on the eve of Milan Fashion Week, with a Lizzo performance for an invitation-only crowd at the company's Milan Roastery. The beverages will be rolled out in Southern California this spring and in Japan, the Middle East and Britain later this year.Story continuesThe La Stampa newspaper in Turin taste-tested four of the beverages, giving them marks of 6.5 to 7.5 on a scale of 10. It noted that the only warm beverage on the menu, a version of caffe latte, “has a strong taste that leaves a pleasant taste in the mouth. Grade: 7.”“The (positive) sensation is that Oleato could be something to drink all year, but most of all that it could be truly tasty in the summer,″ La Stampa said because most are served with ice.Tourists who throng the Milan Roastery are enticed to give the drinks a try by placards around the store and a special menu insert advertising the five-drink assortment, which ranges from 5.50 euros to 14 euros ($5.85 to $14.85) for a martini version with vodka.“It’s good,” said Benedicte Hagen, a Norwegian who recently moved to Milan to pursue a modeling career. “I’m not a big coffee fan, that’s why I like to try drinks like this.”She was sipping the Oleato Golden Foam Cold Brew, which includes vanilla bean syrup, and said she couldn’t really taste the oil. Still, she acknowledged asking the barista to add a shot of chocolate to make the drink even sweeter and would have added caramel if it had been available.“It’s not so random,’’ Hagen decided.Kaya Cupial’s Oleato Iced Cortado, meanwhile, was in a pretty V-shaped glass and garnished with an orange peel. It's made with oat milk infused with olive oil, demerara syrup and a dash of orange bitters.“It’s like normal coffee, but with orange. It’s not strong,’’ noted the 26-year-old from Warsaw, Poland, who was traveling with a group of friends. They also ordered the Golden Foam Cold Brew along with a pair of ordinary cappuccinos.It is not the first time Italy has inspired Schultz. He acknowledges his debt to the Milan coffee bar, which he discovered during a trip to Italy in 1983, as his inspiration for building the now-global coffee chain.Schultz waited until 2018 to bring Starbucks to Italy, aware that he was treading sacred coffee ground. Italians typically take their coffee standing at a bar, chatting with friends or the barista for a few minutes, before continuing their day. It is not something to be nursed.Since then, Starbucks has opened some 20 stores in northern and central Italy.

Price and EPS SurpriseCECO Environmental Corp. Price and EPS SurpriseCECO Environmental Corp. price-eps-surprise | CECO Environmental Corp. QuoteFactors to NoteThe acquisitions of General Rubber LLC (March 2022), Western Air Ducts Limited (June 2022) and DS21 Co. (September 2022) are expected to have boosted CECO Environmental’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.The General Rubber and DS21 Co. buyouts have strengthened the company’s Engineered Systems segment by solidifying its industrial water position and expanding its Effox-Flextor-Mader, Inc. joint venture product offerings. The Western Air Ducts acquisition has expanded CECO’s industrial air product offerings within the Industrial Process Solutions segment.Strength in thermal acoustics technologies, damper and expansion products, separation and filtration technologies, engineered cyclone systems and industrial water technologies is likely to have aided the Engineered Systems segment.The Industrial Process Solutions segment is expected to have benefited from increases in all products serving industrial air end markets.However, a shortage of raw materials, high labor and material costs and supply chain challenges are likely to have dented CECO Environmental’s bottom line. Pricing actions are expected to have partly offset this adversity and aided margins.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CECO Environmental this time around.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is a stock many investors are watching right now. ADM is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.23. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.44. ADM's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.93 and as low as 11.29, with a median of 14.20, all within the past year.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. ADM has a P/S ratio of 0.44. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.05.Finally, we should also recognize that ADM has a P/CF ratio of 8.40. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 8.83. ADM's P/CF has been as high as 14.28 and as low as 8.32, with a median of 10.49, all within the past year.Story continuesThese are only a few of the key metrics included in Archer Daniels Midland's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, ADM looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.60 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -6.56%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this energy drink maker would post earnings of $0.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.60, delivering a surprise of 3.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Monster Beverage , which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, posted revenues of $1.51 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.82%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.43 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Monster Beverage shares have added about 0.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.7%.What's Next for Monster Beverage?While Monster Beverage has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Monster Beverage: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

We have Novavax, AMC, Rivian, and Monster. Kicking off with Novavax, you're looking at losses of just about 23% in extended trading. The reason why is because the company is raising some questions about its ability to stay in business. Now, losses for its most recent quarter, the fourth quarter, totaling 182 million.That, of course, coming on the weaker than expected sales revenue for the quarter, totaling 357 million, missing the Street's expectations. You're looking at the stock selling off here in extended trading, the losses over the last three months just about 43%. So some questions from Novavax executives about the ability to stay in business when you take into account the funding right now and what's needed here going forward.Let's kick it over to AMC-- that stock up just about 1.4% in extended trading. The company issuing a narrower than expected loss here for the quarter. Revenue also beating the Street's expectations, just over 990 million. CEO Adam Aron very optimistic about the turnaround, about the momentum going forward, saying that with more major movies coming this year, highly confident in that multi-year recovery.Over the last three months, the stock has been essentially flat here. Over the last year, certainly a very volatile stock, given the meme trade exposure there. Over the last year, off just about 62%.All right, let's take a look at Rivian. That company also reporting results after the bell, off just about 7% here. The company's production forecast missing expectations. They're now expecting to produce 50,000 vehicles for this year, for 2023. The Street was looking for much more than that-- over 60,000. Revenue also light for the most recent quarter, coming in at 663 millionRivian also announcing that it is recalling 12,700 vehicles because of a sensory issue. This really includes the majority of its vehicles through that September period there. So that's adding some of the pressure to its stock here in after hours.And rounding it out with Monster Beverage-- that stock off nearly at 6% here, announcing a two for one stock split. That will be effective at the end of March on March 28. Net sales missing the Street's expectations-- 1.51 billion. Estimate was for 1.6 billion, as we certainly have seen consumers pull back on some of their spending. Over the last three months, we're looking at this stock off just about 1%]"

Operating income for the 2022 fourth quarter was $394.4 million, compared with $412.9 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. Operating income for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales, as well as the increase in operating expenses.The effective tax rate for both 2022 and 2021 fourth quarters was 23.3 percent. Net income for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 6.1 percent to $301.7 million, from $321.3 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. Net income per diluted share for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.9 percent to $0.57, from $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2021.Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Hilton H. Schlosberg said: “We are pleased to report another quarter of continued revenue growth. The energy drink category continues to expand globally. The results from our overseas operations were again overshadowed by the strength of the United States dollar in the quarter. Gross profit margin percentages increased on a sequential quarterly basis as a result of our pricing actions, as well as certain of our supply chain challenges moderating. “We are continuing to deplete the remaining higher cost imported can inventories in the United States and in EMEA, which should be fully utilized during 2023.  “We believe that some of the increased costs that we have experienced in 2022 are likely to be transitory, although cost inflation, including increases in energy particularly in EMEA, ingredient and other input costs, as well as co-packing fees, remain challenging.“Certain price increases are being implemented on a phased approach during the first half of 2023, some in addition to price increases or pricing actions already taken in 2022,” Schlosberg added.Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer said: “We continued to expand distribution of our brands in our domestic and international markets in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as in the current quarter. In the United States, we launched Monster Energy® Zero Sugar at retail in January 2023, as well as Monster Energy® Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Monster® (stylized) Reserve Kiwi Strawberry, Monster Energy® Nitro Cosmic Peach and Java Monster® Caffe Latte earlier this month. “We recently launched our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product, The Beast Unleashed™ in six states. The Beast Unleashed™ contains six percent alcohol by volume and is available in four flavors. We are pleased with early results and plan to expand into additional markets in the 2023 second quarter, with the goal of being national by the end of the year.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Coca-Cola European and Monster Beverage are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.CCEP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.75, while MNST has a forward P/E of 34.04. We also note that CCEP has a PEG ratio of 2.26. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MNST currently has a PEG ratio of 2.99.Another notable valuation metric for CCEP is its P/B ratio of 3.25. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MNST has a P/B of 7.91.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, CCEP holds a Value grade of B, while MNST has a Value grade of D.Both CCEP and MNST are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that CCEP is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Grainger and Southwest Airlines have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/w-w-grainger-southwest-airlines-142102389.html,1677594062,STORY,"['LUV', 'GWW', 'GIS', 'TPR', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 28, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares W.W. Grainger GWW as the Bull of the Day and Southwest Airlines LUV as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tapestry, Inc. TPR, Conagra CAG and General Mills, Inc. GIS.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Incorporated in 1928, Illinois-based Zacks Rank #1 stock (Strong Buy) W.W. Grainger is a distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) products and services. Its products include material-handling equipment, safety and security supplies, lighting and electrical products, power and hand tools, pumps and plumbing supplies, cleaning and maintenance supplies, and metalworking tools. Grainger’s largest market is North America; however, the company has expanded internationally to Asia, Europe, and South America. The company serves a broad swath of clientele, including the commercial, manufacturing, government, and transportation industries.Q4 Earnings SummaryGrainger reported strong earnings, growing sales, and expanding margins in early February. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.14 in Q4 2022, beating the Zacks Consensus by a margin of 2%. The bottom line improved by 31% year-over-year. Sales rose ~17% year-over-year amid solid new customer acquisition numbers.Fundamental Highlights include:EPS Growth: GWW’s earnings grew 33% year-over-year in Q4 2022. Grainger has benefitted from volume growth in its two primary businesses: High Tech Solutions and Endless Assortment.Surprise History:Grainger consistently beats consensus analyst expectations. The company has rewarded investors with positive earnings surprises for six straight quarters.On average, GWW bests consensus estimates by ~9%.Efficient Business: Grainger is seeing larger margins due to rising profits from its pandemic-related products, lower freight costs, and its ability to navigate supply-chain challenges. From a return on equity perspective (ROE), GWW is one of the strongest companies on Wall Street. GWW boasts an ROE of 60.13 – a staggering number compared to the Industrial Services industry average of 5.53%.Story continuesPast Performance: Adjusted EPS surged 49.5% year-over-year to $29.66 in 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.47. Including one-time items, EPS was $30.06 in 2022 compared with $19.84 in 2021. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus estimate of $15.19 billion. Sales were up 19.3% on a daily, constant currency basis.Rosy Outlook: Consensus analyst estimates show that analysts are becoming more bullish on GWW earnings picture. Because of this, GWW earns a Zacks #1 Rank, putting it in the top 5% of stocks tracked by Zacks.Technical Picture: Following the Q4 EPS release, GWW shares bolted higher by 13% on volume more than double the norm – a bullish sign of accumulation. Since then, shares have been consolidating in a bull flag.A break out above the recent high will present investors with an attractive reward-to-risk zone.Bear of the Day:Based in Dallas, TX, Southwest Airlines is a low-cost airline provider mainly servicing the United States and “ten near-international” markets. Southwest provides short-haul, high-frequency, point-to-point, low-fare services. The company’s point-to-point route structure includes services to and from many secondary or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, and Ft-Lauderdale-Hollywood.Low Cost = Low PerformanceLow-cost carriers like Spiritand Southwest have been dramatically underperforming their larger peers such as United.What's Behind the Underperformance?Unprofitable and moving in the wrong direction: In Q4, Southwest Airlines swung to a loss for the first time in three quarters. The 38-cent loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Adding to the disappointment, Southwest earned 14 cents a year ago.Operational Disruptions: Massive flight cancellations due to extreme winter weather conditions adversely impacted Southwest’s operations. Because Southwest is more focused on one part of the globe when compared to its larger counterparts, the company suffered more. Nearly 17,000 flights were cancelled in the last ten days of 2022 – equating to a pre-tax negative impact of approximately $800 million.In-Fighting &amp; Bad Publicity: Southwest is known and loved by its customers because of the laid-back nature of its flight attendants and employees. This laissez faire attitude is that Southwest management has found that many customers appreciate a less stuffy environment. However, that may change soon.Southwest management and some 18,000 union workers have been in a contract dispute for months. In an era where workers are in high demand, this is not an encouraging sign for Southwest. Until management and the union come to an agreement, the stock is likely to be under pressure. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached, the low-cost carrier will likely face reputational damage and low employee morale.Margins Being Squeezed: Rising fuel and labor costs are causing Southwest’s financial efficiency to take a significant hit. In fact, LUV’s return-on-equity of 6.7% pales in comparison to the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 26.2%.Relative Weakness: When it comes to the stock market, price action = truth. Over the past six months, United Airlines is up 41.0%, while Southwest is down 10.4%ConclusionProspective airline investors should avoid low-cost carriers, such as Southwest and instead opt for larger players such as United Airlines. Southwest has slower growth, shrinking margins, and notable reputational damage to contend with. Furthermore, the price action is disheartening when compared to the market and the airline group.Additional content:E-Commerce Sales to Hit New Highs: 3 Stocks to BuyE-commerce has played a major role in driving retail sales ever since the onset of the pandemic. Although life has bounced back to normal, the spending habit of consumers has changed drastically over the past couple of years, with an increasing number of people shopping online.Be it consumer staples, discretionary items, or consumer durable goods, people are today more confident making their purchases online. This has also made retailers’ online shopping and delivery arms stronger. Given this scenario, stocks like Tapestry, Inc., Conagra and General Mills, Inc. are likely to benefit in the near term.Online Shopping Boosts Retail SalesThe Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 3% month over month in January, surpassing economists’ expectations of a jump of 1.9%. E-commerce once again played a major role in driving overall retail sales, as online sales grew 1.3% month over month.E-commerce has emerged as the most popular mode of shopping. Millions of people chose to shop from home throughout the pandemic due to fears of contracting the COVID-19 virus. They finally understood the benefits of online purchasing as a result of this. Since then, the tendency has prevailed and significantly aided the retail industry.This comes as e-commerce retail sales crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time in 2022. According to ComScore’s annual State of Digital Commerce report, online sales hit $1.09 trillion in 2022, climbing 11% from $904.3 billion recorded in 2021. Overall online sales increased 18% year over year in the fourth quarter.E-Commerce Poised to GrowPeople have been shopping online for years but e-commerce got a boost only after the pandemic, and since then, it has been capturing more market share almost every day. According to a Forbes report, 20.8% of overall retail purchases are expected to be done online in 2023.A physical presence is thus no longer a top priority, with retailers shifting focus toward having a solid web presence that will allow a low barrier to entry for consumers. The report also mentions that 24% of retail purchases will be online by 2026.E-commerce sales are expected to grow 10.3% in 2023, while the global e-commerce market is poised to hit $6.3 trillion in 2023. The U.S. e-commerce market, in particular, is expected to hit $8.1 trillion by 2026.Our ChoicesThis is, thus, the right opportunity to invest in retail stocks that have a strong online presence.Tapestry, Inc.is the designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men in the United States and internationally.

(NYSE:PM) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/77-ownership-philip-morris-international-110014773.html,1677668414,STORY,['PM'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Philip Morris International's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 15 shareholders own 50% of the company Recent sales by insiders Every investor in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Philip Morris International. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Philip Morris International already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Philip Morris International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Philip Morris International is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Capital Research and Management Company is the largest shareholder with 17% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.6% of the company stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Philip Morris International Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$218m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Philip Morris International. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Philip Morris International better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Philip Morris International , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

Over a 13-year time frame, Lynch achieved returns of 29% on average annually – regularly doubling or tripling the general market’s returns in any given year and outperforming 99% of his mutual fund peers. To provide you with an idea of Peter Lynch’s success and reputation, his assets under management (AUM) at the Fidelity Magellan Fund grew from $18 million in the late 1970s to more than $14 billion by 1990 (Lynch’s tenure).What also makes Lynch special is his openness and willingness to share his philosophy. Lynch has written or contributed to several investing books, including his best-seller, “One up on Wall Street.” Today we will cover 5 key lessons we can learn from the legendary investor, including:1. “Invest in what you know.” Peter Lynch achieved meteoric success by sticking to the simple principle of understanding what he owned. Several examples throughout Lynch’s career prove this. Lynch famously read about Dunkin’ Donuts in a newspaper. However, he only purchased shares in the stock after visiting a Dunkin’ Donuts shop and taking a liking to the coffee.Another time, Lynch’s wife tried a new pantyhose product from Hanes Brands Inc called L’eggs. After listening to his wife rave about the product for days, Lynch did his due diligence on the stock and purchased it for the Fidelity Magellan fund. In the end, Hanes produced 30-fold returns for the fund. Pay attention to the products you use in everyday life – they may just lead you to your next investment. Furthermore, if you invest in what you know and understand, you will have more conviction.Story continues2.   “Far more money has been lost by investors trying to time corrections than has been lost in all the corrections combined.” Lynch’s point here is that trying to time very long-term investments such as mutual funds is a fool’s errand. Noting that if you started investing in 1965 and bought the absolute top in the market, your average annual return was 10.6%. Meanwhile, if you invested at the absolute low during that time, your forward return only equated to 11.7% - so you gained just 1.1% for perfect timing. The fact is that over time, U.S. markets tend to rise.Note: Lynch is referring to the overall market and mutual fund strategies. Most successful strategies outside of these realms implement a loss-cutting and risk-management regimen.3.   No mathematical formula that can tell you whether a stock will go up or down: Lynch equates more of his investing success to his philosophy and logic degrees than his mathematics degree. In other words, while mathematics does play a role in investing, mastering your emotions and psychology is just as critical.4.   The Godfather of “Growth at a Reasonable Price” (GARP): Peter Lynch is credited with popularizing the strategy of mixing stocks with reasonable valuations and strong earnings growth. The Fidelity Magellan fund showed investors that combining the two most popular disciplines could lead to outsized returns.5.   Be a slugger, not a base hitter: Peter Lynch achieved his astronomical returns by sticking with up-trending stocks. He caught several “multi-baggers” in stocks like Philip Morris. Lesson: when you’re right, oftentimes the best thing you can do is sit on your hands.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Philip Morris (PM) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Philip Morris is 4.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.8%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Philip Morris has an S/TA ratio of 1.74, which means that the company gets $1.74 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.68, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Philip Morris is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 8.1% this year versus the industry average of 1.2%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Philip Morris. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 6.6% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Philip Morris a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Philip Morris is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NiSource Inc. NI, Spire Inc. SR, Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG and Philip Morris International Inc. PM.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:4 Safe Stocks to Buy as Wall Street Posts Worst Week in 2023All three major indexes in the United States suffered weekly losses, and most of the listed stocks ended sharply lower on Feb 24. The S&amp;P 500, the Dow, and the Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly losses in 2023. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 2.7%, leading to its worst week since Dec 9.The Dow fell 3%, its fourth straight weekly loss, and registered its longest weekly losing streak since May 2022, added the Dow Jones Market Data. The blue-chip index also booked its worst weekly percentage drop since September 2022. The Nasdaq, too, finished 3.3% lower and registered weekly losses in two out of the last three weeks.So, what lead to a bloodbath on Wall Street? A hotter-than-expected Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge was primarily responsible for hurting the stock market. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index increased by 0.6% in January, way more than the 0.2% rise in December.Similarly, the PCE Index advanced 5.4% year over year last month from an increase of 5.3% in December. Excluding the volatile food and fuel prices, the PCE Index still increased and all the readings were higher than anticipated.Prices of gas, fuel, and shelter, to name a few, in reality, scaled upward, regrettably, at the beginning of 2023. The consumer price index (CPI) advanced by 0.5% in January and registered an annual gain of 6.4%, easily topping analysts’ expectations. The core CPI also increased by 0.4% last month and 5.6% year over year, more than what market pundits’ have forecast.Story continuesNow, inflation remaining stubbornly higher this year despite showing some signs of ebbing in the latter half of last year has raised concerns that the Fed will continue to remain aggressive in its monetary policy stance. The central bank is expected to continue hiking interest rates to quell inflationary pressure.Most of the market participants at present expect the central bank to increase interest rates by 25 basis points in March as well as in May. Such a move will push the policy rate to reach 5.36% by mid-summer and could remain elevated at that level for the rest of 2023.However, rate hikes increase the cost of borrowing, discourage consumers from spending, and deter economic growth, resulting in volatility in the stock market. Thus, currently, higher inflation leading to rate hike expectations eventually weighed on the markets.But investors shouldn’t panic! They should instead invest their hard-earned money in stocks that provide risk-adjusted returns, like NiSource Inc., Spire Inc., Conagra Brands, Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc.These stocks have a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1) and are dividend players. Hence, they have a solid business model and are less susceptible to market uncertainty. They are also non-cyclical in nature since they are part of the utility and consumer staples sectors. This makes them immune to market volatility. These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NiSource is an energy holding company and, together with its subsidiaries, provides natural gas, electricity, and other products and services in the United States.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Payment Companies in the World. The advent of the Internet has revolutionized business and created new technologies for people to conduct their daily lives. One such area is business, where firms now have access to a global workforce that lets them offshore their tasks to employees in other countries to save up on costs. At the same time, firms can collect their payments digitally as well, which reduces the need of keeping cash at hand for both them and the consumer.At the heart of this facilitation is the payments processing industry. This industry started up along with the internet, as PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) became one of the first firms that disrupted the traditional banking model and enabled users to make and accept payments over the Internet. Since then, both traditional players and new entrants have entered into the market. As a result, the global payments industry was worth a whopping $92 billion in 2021 according to research from Precedence Research. From this, it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.49% until 2030, by the end of which the firm believes it will have an estimated market value of $572 billion.Within the market, there are a couple of trends that are contributing to its growth. These include the widespread adoption of smartphones, which provide users with a convenient way to manage their finances by easily accessing the Internet and using software applications. Additionally, and particularly as the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated, the demand for online shopping is immense, due to the convenience offered in both browsing through items and receiving them without having to leave the comfort of one's home. Zooming in on different industry segments, the one dealing with plastic currency or debit cards forms the largest segment, and companies are also increasingly starting to rely on the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to weed out fraudulent activities on their platform. Artificial intelligence, as futuristic as it sounds, is simply an advanced form of linear regression that reaches conclusions about a set of data points by either using pre-fed parameters or evaluating new data sets. Within fraud detection, this generally involves taking a database of previously fraudulent transactions, and using their specific parameters, such as frequency, amount, and location, to train the algorithm for future events.Story continuesAccounting and financial firm Deloitte takes a deeper look within the industry to further closely analyze what lies in the future for this disruptive and critical sector. It explains that instantaneous - or real time - payment processing will continue to expand in the U.S. as it will expand its coverage to also include business to business and business to consumer use cases. These involve areas such as payroll processing and more. Deloitte adds that the growth of gig economies is also fueling digital payments since workers in several areas do not have access to the traditional financial system such as banking accounts. Deloitte adds that a crucial market area that is gaining traction these days is one where companies act as an intermediary between a bank that has issued a plastic currency card and the merchant that is accepting payments from the card.As the industry starts to mature and more firms enter, existing players are looking at means to improve their customer relationships to retain market share. This was also on PayPal's chief executive officer (CEO) Mr. Daniel Schulman's mind as he explained the steps that his firm is taking to improve the customer shopping experience and improve the ease with which they can carry out transactions with each other. Mr. Schulman's comments came during his company's earnings call for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 as he outlined:We are putting significant resources behind the modernization of our checkout experience in order to defend and grow our market share in our branded checkout business. This includes a drive towards passwordless, one click native in-app experiences as well as deploying the next generation of advanced checkout using our data and AI capabilities. Although this will be a multiyear initiative and will take time given the scale of our base and our legacy integrations, I am extremely pleased with the progress we made last year. We will continue to deliver scaled growth for Braintree. And last year, we made significant progress in modernizing our architecture and capabilities. These improvements resulted in a substantial number of new sales and incremental volume from existing accounts.In addition, we have an impressive pipeline of opportunity for 2023. In the first half of this year, we intend to fully ramp our unbranded offering to small and midsized businesses, either directly or through channel partners. The launch of PPCP, or PayPal Complete Payments, will meaningfully expand our unbranded total addressable market by as much as $750 billion, and enables us to drive incremental share with higher margins than our Braintree Enterprise service. On the consumer side, we’ll continue to enhance our digital wallet value proposition. We are focused on the end-to-end customer experience, from onboarding to the entirety of the consumer life cycle, utilizing more advanced forms of AI to drive optimal consumer choices. In the past two years, we have introduced a significant number of products and services.Today, we'll look at some of the largest payment companies in the world, with the top picks being Visa Inc.

109,4fbaf107-76f4-36e0-8332-71fdc4da9a7b,GS,2023-03-01,Goldman Sach boss ‘DJ D-Sol’ faces frustration as bank struggles to find its groove,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dj-d-sol-faces-frustration-110339569.html,1677668619,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[DJ Sol David Solomon - Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicOn a balmy Friday in late July last year, David Solomon hopped on his company’s Gulfstream G650 private jet bound for Chicago.The chief executive of Goldman Sachs was headed to the Windy City for meetings with employees and clients. Yet his main engagement that weekend was a very different sort of gathering, taking place just a ten minute drive from Goldman’s Chicago office in Grant Park: Lollapalooza.The four-day music festival boasted worldwide stars including Metallica, Dua Lipa and Green Day on its line-up. Solomon – who moonlights as a DJ in his spare time and goes by the name DJ D-Sol – was also performing.Dressed in a black t-shirt, the 60-year-old father of two was videoed doing his best Fatboy Slim impression as a group of young revellers bounced around to his roster of hits.In a post on his personal Instagram account, Solomon said: “Lolla was full of special moments, but this was the best” in a nod to a performance of his song “Learn To Love Me”.Yet while DJ D-Sol is clearly having a good time, Goldman Sachs’ investors are finding it difficult to learn to love Solomon.Profits at Goldman Sachs have now been falling for more than a year as a misfiring bet on consumer lending wracks up billions in losses. The bank's share price has lagged rivals since Solomon took charge in 2018 and doubts about his strategy are growing louder, with one City analyst saying Goldman is “flailing”.Goldman Sachs David Solomon - BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERSOn Tuesday, Solomon attempted to get shareholders back on side by hosting only the second ever investor day in Goldman’s 154-year history.In an olive branch to disgruntled investors, Solomon pledged to explore ""strategic alternatives"" for its loss-making consumer business.Since taking charge, Solomon has pushed headlong into retail banking under Goldman’s Marcus brand and through credit card partnerships with Apple and General Motors.Last year it bought GreenSky, a point-of-sale lender. This is a far cry from the corporate M&amp;A work that Solomon, a veteran investment banker, made his name doing.Story continuesThe strategy has not paid off. Earlier this year, Goldman revealed that its newly formed consumer lending and fintech unit had suffered $3bn in pre-tax losses since 2020.“It became clear that we lacked certain competitive advantages and that we did too much too quickly,” Solomon conceded on Tuesday, pledging to stop losses at the division by 2025.Goldman has already sidelined its retail bank Marcus, announcing at the end of last year that it was folding the business into its wealth management division as part of a reorganisation.“We’ve narrowed ambitions in the consumer space,” Solomon said. “We will do what’s right for Goldman Sachs, we’re focused on it and we will execute appropriately.”Solomon is under growing pressure to improve performance after continually lagging behind stock market rivals in recent years. Shares in arch rival JPMorgan are up a third over the last five years, while Goldman has climbed by just a quarter.Critics argue that the bank’s historic strengths in investment banking and trading make it more suited for a pre-financial crisis era.New regulations force banking giants to hold much higher levels of capital than they once did, making trading strategies less profitable. Goldman is also more vulnerable during periods of subdued market activity, such as last year’s dealmaking drought following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, than rivals with broader businesses.The bank has been trying to diversify its business for years but has struggled, in part because of its well entrenched culture of investment banking and trading.Profits plunged by two-thirds in the final quarter of 2022, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of falling profits.The quiet deals market and the mammoth losses at its consumer unit forced Goldman to embark on its biggest cost-cutting drive since the financial crisis earlier this year.In January, it announced it was cutting more than 3,000 jobs, while it has also reduced bonuses and launched a sweeping review of spending in an attempt to rein in costs.Solomon told investors on Tuesday: “Sometimes we fall short. Sometimes we don't execute. But we always learn and adapt.”Brennan Hawken, an analyst at UBS, told Bloomberg: “It’s not good to see Goldman flailing. There’s a perception that all the partners are not singing from the same hymn book. It leads investors to conclude that the CEO might be losing confidence of the partners. And that is worrying.”Analysts are concerned that there is no quick fix for Goldman’s malaise. Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar, said: ""Earnings could continue to be subdued for the next year or more, as the economic environment remains uncertain, which should pressure investment banking and asset management revenue.”Solomon on Tuesday reaffirmed a target for return on tangible equity – a key measure of profitability for banks – of 15pc to 17pc, which was higher than its target in previous years. However, the target is still lower than rivals Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan.Bosses at Goldman believe its $2.5 trillion asset and wealth management business is key to unlocking future growth.Solomon told CNBC on Tuesday: “The real story for growth for us is asset management and wealth management. There’s a real opportunity for us to continue to make the firm more durable.”However, the investor day also appeared to do little to quell investor concerns: shares in the bank were down 3pc in afternoon trading in the US.Meanwhile, Solomon also warned that operating in China will get tougher over the next few years, given the rising tensions between the communist state and the West.He told CNBC: ""We are at a very tough place in bilateral relations with China and my own view is it only gets tougher ... It is a more 'cautious' time for investment in our own franchise.”Shareholders looking for reassurance may take succour from the latest post on Solomon’s personal Instagram account, promoting his new track featuring German DJ TMW. The title of the song? “Nothing I Won’t Do.”Investors will be hoping that attitude applies to turning around the stumbling Wall Street giant as well as dance music.]"

Not long ago, Solomon was riding high as Goldman took advantage of the IPO and SPAC boom of 2020 and 2021, leading the firm’s stock to soar more than 200% between the COVID-lows of March 2020 and its September 2021 peak. The shoe is on the other foot now.More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash? Consider a checking account bonusThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 homeProfits at the investment banking giant plummeted nearly 70% year over year in 2022 as dealmaking collapsed amid recession fears and rising interest rates. And Solomon was under the microscope Tuesday as Goldman offered a report card of his tenure, tracking performance against long-term targets in an attempt to boost investor confidence in the CEO’s overall performance. Solomon was then forced to admit that Marcus, Goldman’s consumer banking arm, was a mistake and his team had failed to “execute well.” The CEO said Goldman is stepping back from its consumer banking push as losses mount and pivoting to another potential golden goose: asset management.Goldman is already the world’s fifth-largest active asset manager, and Solomon has made moves to boost the business since October when he combined Goldman’s asset management and private wealth businesses into a single entity, marking the third major reorganization at the company within four years.“The real story of opportunity for growth for us in the coming years is around asset management and wealth management,” he told CNBC Tuesday at the firm’s investor day gathering. “There’s real opportunity across the firm for us to continue to make the firm more durable.”A Marcus misfireMarcus was launched in 2016 under former CEO Lloyd Blankfein and offers consumers a full suite of financial services including checking and savings accounts, personal loans, and even automated investment management services. Blankfein said when launching the service that Goldman had serious competitive advantages in technology and risk management that would attract consumers to Marcus and allow it to outperform its peers in consumer banking.Story continuesSolomon—who is known for working as a part-time DJ and taking a Gulfstream jet to the Bahamas for weekend getaways—took control of Goldman from Blankfein in 2018 after serving for a decade as cohead of the investment banking division and quickly turned to expanding Marcus. In 2020, he praised the offering, arguing that it was “excellent by any standard” and telling investors he planned to move forward with a consumer-focused “long-term strategy.”But in the years since, Goldman’s consumer banking business has lost more than $3 billion, and Insider’s Dakin Campbell reported earlier this month that some of Goldman’s more than 400 partners are complaining about Solomon’s poor performance, going so far as to put forward potential replacement candidates. The news comes after Goldman slashed 3,200 jobs and cut partners’ compensation by roughly 50% after its 2022 profit plunge, according to unnamed current and former partners Insider spoke with.Multiple senior partners, including the former head of the asset management division, have also left the firm under Solomon’s tenure. And Goldman was forced to set aside $2.3 billion this year for legal fees to prepare for the verdict on a 12-year-old gender bias suit, the fallout from the collapse of hedge fund Archegos in 2021, and various other lawsuits.Changing the narrative?Bank of America analysts, led by Ebrahim Poonawala, said in a Monday research note that Goldman’s investor day was a chance for Solomon to regain control of the increasingly pessimistic “strategic narrative” among investors about his firm.“This narrative has been clouded by the persistent negative headlines tied to the consumer business (losses, personnel departures, product delays/terminations, regulatory scrutiny), which have given the impression that the Goldman leadership has lost control of delivering on its strategic priorities,” they wrote.The analysts recommended Solomon opt for a “course correction” away from the consumer-focused banking strategy and toward more “strategically and financially viable” alternatives. The CEO may have liked the report, because he followed BofA’s playbook to a tee, assuring investors that the firm has “narrowed ambitions in the consumer space”—and even hinting that he might offload the consumer platform altogether.“It was clear we lacked [a] certain competitive advantage, and we did too much too quickly, which affected our execution,” Solomon told audience members at Goldman’s investor day, noting he was considering “strategic alternatives.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash?

119,1a8b5bb7-bbdd-3699-98fe-8816b9e73d1d,SLB,2023-03-01,Should You Be Adding Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) To Your Watchlist Today?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adding-schlumberger-nyse-slb-watchlist-120048870.html,1677672048,STORY,['SLB'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Schlumberger's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Impressively, Schlumberger's EPS catapulted from US$1.34 to US$2.41, over the last year. It's a rarity to see 79% year-on-year growth like that.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Schlumberger shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 12% to 15%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Schlumberger's future EPS 100% free.Are Schlumberger Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Schlumberger, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$167m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesShould You Add Schlumberger To Your Watchlist?Schlumberger's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, Schlumberger is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. Still, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Schlumberger.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

120,3ad97a2a-c69f-3eda-b1fa-16c9e0cf76b5,SLB,2023-03-01,25 Largest Energy Companies by Market Cap,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-largest-energy-companies-market-184619232.html,1677609979,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F', 'DUK', 'ENB', 'EOG', 'SO', 'EPD', 'ENLAY', 'IBE.MC', 'CNQ', 'SLB', 'CVX']","[In the article, we discuss the 25 largest energy companies according to their market capitalization. You can skip the industry analysis and go directly to the 10 Largest Energy Companies In the World.The energy sector is a $6 trillion industry that employed around 6.8 million people in the United States in 2022. The energy industry can be divided into two major subgroups, non-renewable or conventional energy, and renewable energy. The non-renewable energy sector includes petroleum and gas products, nuclear, and coal. Renewable energy sources include wind power generation, biofuels, hydroelectric power, and solar power.Conventional Energy MarketIn 2022, conventional energy with the exception of nuclear energy accounted for 85% of the global energy supply. According to a report by McKinsey, the global coal demand reached its peak in 2013 and saw a rise in demand again in 2021. However, it is expected to go in the downward direction from then onwards. Additionally, International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that electricity production from coal in the United States will reduce from 20% in 2022 to 17% in 2024.When it comes to fossil fuels, oil, and natural gas are the most commonly used sources of energy. According to IEA, the global oil demand is expected to rise by 1.9 million barrels a day to a record 101.7 million barrels a day. The most significant demand will be seen by jet fuel at 840,000 barrels of oil per day. McKinsey believes that the global oil demand is expected to peak between 2023 and 2025. However, it will be 35% to 50% lower by 2050 due to the global transition toward renewable energy sources. A significant decline in demand is expected to be caused by the rise in electric vehicles, which according to IEA will account for 60% of new car sales by 2030.According to the IEA, the global gas demand was 87.9 billion cubic feet per day. The McKinsey report states that it will grow by 10%-20% by 2035 and will likely experience a decline afterward.Story continuesCurrently, the global market leaders in the conventional energy market are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Effects of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine on the Conventional Energy MarketThe Russian invasion of Ukraine was one of the most significant events that created uncertainty in the global conventional energy market as a huge part of Europe has been dependent on Russian fuel. The invasion led to the US President Joe Biden issuing an executive order to ban Russian imports and the United Kingdom took the same route. Due to the European Union's dependency on Russian fossil fuels, it did not cut off the imports entirely but decided to reduce them by around two-thirds, mostly due to Germany and Netherlands' reluctance. In 2021, Russia accounted for 13% of the global crude oil supply and 45% of the global natural gas imports, along with 40% of the European Union's demand. On top of that, the country was also responsible for almost 18% of global coal imports.The aforementioned series of decisions led the global supply of fossil fuels to fall and demand to rise significantly. Consequently, crude oil prices went skyrocketing to $110 per barrel in March 2022 from $76 at the beginning of the year. For 2023, S&amp;P Global forecasted that the global oil supply and demand will start to balance out. However, the effects of cutting off Russian oil had more severe repercussions than expected and the global market will take a few years to return to normal levels. The firm expects the growth to be slower in 2023 than in 2022 at 1.7 million barrels per day compared to the prior year's 4.5 million barrels per day. Nevertheless, the prices of fuel commodities are expected to alleviate over the year.Renewable Energy MarketAccording to Allied Market Research, the global renewable energy market was worth $881.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% to almost $2 trillion by 2030. The previously mentioned McKinsey report states that due to the move towards renewable energy and decarbonization, the energy sector is expected to grow by 4% per annum and annual supply and production investments are most likely to reach $1.5 trillion to $1.6 by 2035.Toward the decarbonization of the energy mix, electrification is considered the first step. Electricity generation through wind, solar, and hydrogen power is expected to account for almost 50% of the global power mix by 2035 and then increase to 85% by 2050. Moreover, among the renewable energy sources, green hydrogen is expected to cover 28% of the global power demand by the end of the forecasted period. In the article, we previously mentioned the fall in electricity production from coal. The IEA expects that to be counteracted by renewable energy sources as they rise from 22% in 2022 to 24% in 2024.With the growing demand for renewable energy, even the big players in the conventional energy market are making a shift toward it. Even the oil supermajors have started to invest in renewable energy projects with BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) becoming the first one among them to invest a noteworthy amount.At the moment the companies aiming toward becoming the global renewable energy giants include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB), and Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) along with several others.25 Largest Energy Companies by Market CapPhoto by RawFilm on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we identified the biggest energy companies by market capitalization and listed them in ascending order.

The market has been growing in recent years due to increasing urbanization, rising disposable incomes, and a growing population.According to Statista, the global furniture market was valued at $557 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to rise steadily to over $650.7 billion by 2027. Several major industry players are expanding their operations. For example, in 2022, Ashley Furniture, started work on its 50,000 sq. ft. fulfillment center in Arcadia, while IKEA is tapping into the Asian market by increasing the number of stores in countries like India, China, and the Philippines.After the outbreak of COVID-19, with more people working from home and spending more time indoors, there has been a surge in demand for home office furniture, as well as furniture for home entertainment and relaxation areas. With the surge in e-commerce and online sales, many furniture sellers increased their investments in technology. For example, IKEA, the Swedish furniture giant that is popular for its in-store experience, is now taking this experience to the virtual world through IKEA Place.Most Valuable Furniture Companies In The WorldStjepan Tafra/Shutterstock.comCompanies like Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) and MillerKnoll Inc (NASDAQ:MLKN) are already offering power-enabled and adjustable designs. In the future, we may see more of these furniture companies collaborating with technology companies to offer high-tech furniture products to customers. For example, LG has recently revealed their Puricare Aero Furniture, a table that doubles as an air-purifier with a mood-lighting feature. Moreover, MillerKnoll Inc (NASDAQ:MLKN) collaborated with Logitech G, a manufacturer of computer accessories, to create a gaming chair called Vantum. The tech company’s research enabled the furniture manufacturer to identify customer pain points and create a specialized product.Story continuesAs in most other industries, the furniture industry has renewed its focus on sustainability measures. Positive developments have been made, such as Williams-Sonoma, Inc.  (NYSE:WSM) stating its intention to plant 6 million trees by the end of 2023 and La-Z-Boy Inc. publishing its first ESG Report. Consumers are also willing to buy more environmentally friendly products, as evidenced by the fact that the Indian furniture giant Godrej Interio was able to generate 47% of its revenue from environmentally friendly products in FY23.Statista reports that in terms of revenue, US furniture market was the largest in the world, producing revenue of over $226.78 billion in 2021.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Income-generating stocks are all the rage as the stock market suffered huge losses last year. According to a report by Reuters, Wall Street recorded its biggest annual drop in 2022 since the financial crisis of 2008, as the S&amp;P 500 shed nearly $8 trillion in market cap. Growth stocks also recorded their worst performance in a decade, turning investors’ attention toward overlooked dividend equities.Quality companies that have raised their payouts for a significant period are considered safe during fluctuating market conditions. Historical analysis of these stocks shows that they have outperformed their peers when turbulence in the market occurs. Over the past five decades, dividend growers have surpassed other asset classes when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually, as reported by Sterling Capital. Another reason why dividends make reliable investments is due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. According to a report by Schroders, the average annual return across eight markets was 4.3% in the last 25 years, which increased to an average of 7.1% including reinvested dividends.Analysts often advise investing in companies that have proven track records of dividend growth, as these companies are likely to continue growing their payouts in the long term. In addition to this, such companies are considered less risky as they have stable cash flows and histories of profitability. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some major dividend companies with solid dividend growth streaks and strong balance sheets. In view of this, we will discuss the best consistent dividend stocks to buy in this article.Story continues16 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for at least 10 years.

In February, Barclays initiated its coverage of the stock with an Equal Weight rating and a $135 price target, expressing concerns over slowing industry demand.Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

(NYSE:WSM), worth over $305.3 million collectively.Voss Capital mentioned Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We believe shorting furniture retailers has arguably become a consensus view on the back of widely known tough comps from early 2021 (+26% and +40% SSS Comps for WSM in calendar Q1/Q2 ‘21) and fear of pull forward of demand, which seems to be corroborated by weak credit card data in the category the last few weeks and a poor outlook from furniture e-Commerce giant Wayfair, not to mention a panic-inducing, rambling conference call from the oft colorful CEO of Restoration Hardware. Lazy thematic macro analysis that stops there, however, paints an incomplete picture of what has transpired at many individual companies like WSM that have been deemed COVID beneficiaries that are now at all-time low valuations.WSM is a furniture and home décor retailer that owns several well-known brands: William Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Rejuvenation, Mark &amp; Graham, and most importantly, west elm. While perhaps thought of as a dying mall-based brick &amp; mortar retailer, WSM derives the vast majority (66%+) of its revenue from e-Commerce and has been a remarkably steady performer, remaining free cash flow positive every year since at least 2007 and achieving positive same store sales comps since 2010, including +17% in 2020, +22% in 2021 with guidance for a further mid-to-high single digit growth again this year. Within the overall positive sales trends, west elm’s consistent growth has been even more impressive, with a 16% average annual same-store sales growth rate since 2012. To little fanfare, by our calculation, WSM has become the single highest quality retailer in public markets with a 58% return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2021 and a 39% ROIC on average over the past 3 years…” (Click here to see the full text)14.

Here’s what the firm said:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments.

The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and its tactical approaches to accelerate growth also buoy optimism. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and a soft volume environment are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 5.1% against the 17.5% decline of the industry and the 9.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of diagnostic information services has a market capitalization of $15.44 billion. The company projects 2.4% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Quest Diagnostics surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 7%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Base Volume Improves: We are optimistic about Quest Diagnostics’ base testing volumes or base business, which refers to testing volumes excluding COVID-19 testing. The company is increasing its efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in the base business. Quest Diagnostics continued to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2022.Accelerate Growth Strategy Bodes Well: Quest Diagnostics continues to progress in terms of its tactical approaches to accelerate growth, the first part of its two-point strategy, raising our optimism. In terms of growth through M&amp;A, the company has announced an outreach lab purchase from Ohio-based Summa Health. Quest Diagnostics has also announced a professional lab services relationship with Southwest Florida-based Lee Health to provide supply-chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee Health and selected outpatient centers.To accelerate growth through health plan access, the company continued to gain traction with value-based contracts, where it sees higher growth than traditional contracts.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: Quest Diagnostics’ better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 earnings and revenues buoy our optimism. During the reported quarter, the base business registered growth and the company has also ramped up investments to accelerate growth in the base business, particularly in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing.DownsidesStiff Competition: Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market, compared to Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including the accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs primarily based on the quality of service.Soft Volume Environment: Pressure on volume, owing to a difficult macroeconomic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, was down 11.2% year over year in the fourth quarter. Revenues per requisition declined 5.1% year over year due to lower COVID-19 molecular testing volume.Estimate TrendQuest Diagnostics has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 2.7% north to $8.69.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.20 billion, suggesting a 15.6% decline from the year-ago reported number.This compares to our first-quarter 2023 revenue estimate of $2.20 billion, suggesting a 15.7% plunge from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, McKesson Corporation MCK and Avanos Medical, Inc. AVNS.Hologic, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 15.2%.

(HOLX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-attracting-investor-140002130.html,1677592802,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned -2.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has lost 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -57.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.74 points to a change of -37.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +7%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4 indicates a change of +7.1% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $967.05 million indicates a year-over-year change of -32.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.97 billion and $4.13 billion estimates indicate -18.4% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with $2.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $980.98 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.5%. The EPS surprise was +18.89%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Still, developers say they often receive upfront payments to include their titles in the catalog and bonuses for games that do well on the service.However, Microsoft's proposed deal with gaming firm Activision Blizzard, Inc (NASDAQ: ATVI) faced opposition over antitrust concerns.Regulators in the U.S., Europe, and the U.K. opposed Microsoft's Activision deal that allegedly cemented its preeminent position in a nascent market.Recently Microsoft cut decade-long deals with Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Nintendo Co, Ltd (OTC: NTDOF) (OTC: NTDOY) to win over opposition against its Activision deal.Story continuesPrice Action: MSFT shares traded higher by 0.14% at $250.50 premarket on the last check Tuesday.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Phillips 66 is:33% = US$11b ÷ US$34b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.33 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Phillips 66's Earnings Growth And 33% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Phillips 66 has an impressive ROE. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 31% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light. However, while Phillips 66 has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 5.5%. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Phillips 66's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 13% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is PSX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Phillips 66 Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Phillips 66's low three-year median payout ratio of 16% (implying that it retains the remaining 84% of its profits) comes as a surprise when you pair it with the shrinking earnings. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.Additionally, Phillips 66 has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 43% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 13%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Phillips 66 has some positive aspects to its business. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Moreover, after studying current analyst estimates, we discovered that the company's earnings are expected to continue to shrink in the future.

Rates would then fall to 6.5% within 12 months, the poll showed.In January, when compared with the previous month, the IMACEC index rose 0.5%, the central bank said.The year-on-year results was explained by services and mining, which were partly offset by a drop in trade, while the monthly increase was driven by basically all groups surveyed, it added. The IMACEC accounts for nearly 90% of the South American country's GDP. (Reporting by Fabian Andres Cambero and Gabriel Araujo; Editing by Steven Grattan)]"

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 7.5% loss over the past four weeks.Shares of McEwen Mining Inc. have gained following the announcement that Nuton LLC, a Rio Tinto RIO Venture will make an additional $30 million investment in MUX’s subsidiary  McEwen Copper Inc..Per the agreement, Nuton will acquire shares of McEwen Copper in a two-part transaction which consists a private placement of 350,000 McEwen Copper common shares and purchase of 1,250,000 common shares owned by McEwen Mining in a secondary sale. Proceeds of the subscription and purchase are expected to be around $6.5 million to McEwen Copper and $23.5 million McEwen Mining, respectively.The proceeds of the private placement will be used to advance development of the Los Azules copper project in San Juan, Argentina, and for general corporate purposes. After closing of deal, which is expected by Mar 10, 2023, Nuton will own 14.2% of McEwen Copper on a fully diluted basis, and McEwen Mining will own 51.9%.This gold and silver mining company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +54%. Revenues are expected to be $29.4 million, down 16% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For McEwen, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.Paul Wright: Thanks, Toby and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call. I'd like to start the presentation by speaking to Centerra's short-term strategy as we continue to maintain our goal of establishing a stable and strong platform for future growth. This entails firstly obtaining all the regulatory approvals to restart operations at our ÃksÃ¼t Mine. Continuing to optimize operations and exploration at the Mount Milligan Mine, advancing the Goldfield Project with initial resource estimate midyear 2023, followed by a feasibility study. Updating our view on the Molybdenum Business Unit which future will be described as MBU, including the issuance of a pre-feasibility study detailing a potential restart of the Thompson Creek Mine and this is to be delivered in Q3 of 2023.Story continuesMoving on to Slide 5. Firstly, an update on the ÃksÃ¼t Mine. In January 2023, we received notices of approval for the operating license extension for a period of 10 years as well as an enlarged grazing land permit allowing for the expansion of the mine areas. These 2 important approvals demonstrate the continued support for both the company and the ÃksÃ¼t Mine. Also in January 2023, the amended EIA was submitted for regulatory review. This remains in process with government authorities now reviewing our technical studies to support our EIA amendment. The mercury abatement retrofit to the ADR plant is now complete and following regulatory approvals which are underway, we will be positioned to process gold at the rate of 35,000 ounces per month.As of December 31, 2022, there were 100,000 ounces of gold stored in carbon and 200,000 ounces recoverable in the inventory on the heap leach pads and in stockpiles. Concerning the recent tragic earthquakes in Turkey, there were no injuries to our employees or contractors and fortunately, no damage to the infrastructure at the dip mine. I will speak more to this on the next slide. Moving on to ÃksÃ¼t. The company reported Q4 2022 and full year 2022 gold production of 53,000 ounces and 244,000 ounces, respectively. There were 189,000 ounces of payable gold and 74 million pounds of copper produced by Mount Milligan in 2022 and 55,000 ounces of gold produced and sold by the ÃksÃ¼t Mine in Q1 2022 prior to the shutdown of operations on March 18, 2022.In January, we announced Mount Milligan's guidance for the year which includes gold production of 160,000 to 170,000 ounces, copper production of 60 million to 70 million pounds, gold production costs of $900 to $950 an ounce and all-in sustaining costs on a byproduct basis of $1,075 to $1,125 an ounce. As mentioned earlier, the company continues to evaluate strategic options for the MBU, including a potential restart of the Thompson Creek Mine based on the continued strengthening of molybdenum prices and positive medium-term outlook. A prefeasibility detailing must restart of Thompson Creek is planned for Q3 2023. At Goldfield, we continue our advancement of the project and completed approximately 50,000 meters of drilling in 2022 which will be incorporated in our planned initial resource estimate midyear.Moving on to Slide 6. In 2022, we had a number of ESG highlights and I won't touch on all of these. But first, I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the people of Turkey and particularly those who lost loved ones due to the natural disaster. In support of the Turkish government's efforts, Centerra has mobilized an emergency response teams from the ÃksÃ¼t Mine to assist Turkish state emergency preparedness authorities and regional disaster response organizations. The company continues to provide equipment and material support to the ongoing recovery activities were possible. And we have coordinated with one of our mining contractors to support the recovery effort with equipment and supplies as well as trucks and crews and continue to assist the local authorities in providing temporary housing.Moving forward in Q4 2022, Centerra successfully completed the full rollout of the responsible gold mining principles. This has been a consistent and committed effort from many Centerra employees, especially at our Mount Milligan and ÃksÃ¼t operations. We recognize and appreciate all this hard work. Additionally, the company continued to demonstrate that safety remains Centerra's top priority, having achieved 1 million hours of milestone with auto lost time injury at the Mount Milligan Mine. I'll now pass the baton over to Paul Chawrun who will walk through Centerra's operational highlights for the third quarter.Paul Chawrun: Thank you, Paul. On Slide 8, we have the operating highlights at Mount Milligan for both the quarter and the year. 2022 was a good year for Mount Milligan. Firstly, we achieved a record annual throughput for the plant at 21.3 million tonnes. Additionally, the mine operated well with a total material mined at 44.3 million tonnes and ore mined at approximately 19.4 million tonnes. Cash provided and free cash flow from mine operations for 2022 were $162 million and $100 million, respectively. Gold production costs remained low at $790 per ounce in Q4 and $767 per ounce for the year. All-in sustaining costs on a byproduct basis was $629 per ounce in Q4 and $630 per ounce for the financial year of 2022. We continue to remain committed to the optimization of our life-of-mine plan.Gold, Ore, ExcavationPhoto by Mohamed Nohassi on UnsplashAnd as mentioned in our January 2023 release, we anticipate higher gold and copper production in 2024 and 2025 than is shown in the most recent 43-101 technical report published last October. On the exploration front, we have completed approximately 55,000 meters of drilling since the most recent resource update. The copper head grade for the year was 0.2% with a metal recovery at 81.9%. The gold head grade was 0.42 grams per tonne with a metal recovery at 66.9%. The copper grades were lower than in previous years, primarily because we are starting to feed a higher proportion of the high-grade gold low-grade copper ore which is planned to continue in 2023. The staged flotation reactors have been operating since the beginning of May with circuit optimization and full commissioning completed in the fourth quarter.The initial results have indicated elevated recoveries as planned. So moving to Slide 9. So here, we provide the operating results for ÃksÃ¼t. As Paul previously mentioned, we received notices of approval of our operating license extension in January 2023 which is valid for 10 years as well as the enlarged grazing land permit allowing for the expansion of the mining areas. The amended EIA was submitted for this January for regulatory review and remains in progress. Construction of the mercury abatement retrofit to the ADR plant is now complete and ended up being completed below the original budget of $5 million. Following regulatory approvals and restart of the ADR plant, after operations ramp up, we will be in a position to process gold at a rate of up to 35,000 ounces per month.2023 mining activities at ÃksÃ¼t will be focused on the Phase 5 wall pushback to expand the Keltepe Pit. As of December 31, 2022, ore processed into stored gold and carbon inventory is approximately 100,000 recoverable ounces with an additional approximately 200,000 recoverable ounces on the heap leach pad and in stockpiles. Moving on to Slide 10. We announced our 2023 operating guidance for Mount Milligan in January. Paul already provided the production highlights but I'd like to add some additional color. Mount Milligan's gold production for 2023 of 160,000 to 170,000 ounces and copper production of 60 million to 70 million pounds is expected to be weighted higher in the second half of the year with approximately 30% to 35% of the concentrate sales expected to occur in the fourth quarter.The lower overall production in 2023 compared to 2022 is driven by mine sequencing with the grade profile of both gold and copper slightly lower than in 2022. Mount Milligan gold production cost for the year are expected to be in the range of $900 to $950 per ounce sold. The all-in sustaining costs on a byproduct basis in 2023 are expected to be in the range of $1,075 to $1,125 per ounce due to the higher production costs, higher capital expenditures and lower copper byproduct credits due to the lower copper sales estimated for 2023 when compared to 2022. Moving to Slide 11. Touching briefly on the reserves and resource update, first with Mount Milligan. In October 2022, we released a new reserve estimate and life-of-mine plan showing an increase of 1.1 million contained ounces of gold and 260 million pounds of contained copper which extended the mine life by 4 years to 2023 -- 2033.This update was effective December 31, 2021. So just highlighting that the 2022 year-end reserves and resource statement applies to the depletion that occurred in the past year. Approximately 55,000 meters of drilling that was completed in 2022 will be used to update the current resource model which will be incorporated into 2023 mineral reserves and resources update next year. As of year-end 2022, the estimated proven and probable gold mineral reserves at Mount Milligan totaled 2.6 million ounces of contained gold. For copper, the estimated proven and probable reserves totaled 902 million pounds of contained copper. On Slide 12. At the ÃksÃ¼t Mine, proven and probable reserves totaled an estimated 0.9 million ounces of contained gold as of December 31, 2022, compared to the estimated 1.1 million ounces of contained gold as of year-end 2021.A portion of the decrease of 0.2 million ounces in proven and probable gold reserves can be attributed to the processing of ore this past year into an existing inventory of gold and carbon which, as we said previously, is estimated to be 100,000 ounces. And in addition, there are over 200,000 ounces of recoverable gold contained on the heap leach pad and stockpiles. Our resource update to include exploration drilling completed in 2022 is ongoing and will be included in the 2023 mineral reserves update. As you would expect, our focus in 2022 for ÃksÃ¼t was to prepare and submit underlying technical studies to support the amended EIA, deliver the mercury abatement retrofit to the ADR plant on time and under budget and prepare for the operational restart.On Slide 13, we outlined the reserves and resources for the MBU. So as of December 31, 2022, the total measured and indicated resources at the TCM total an estimated 177 million pounds of contained molybdenum and an estimated 166 million pounds of contained molybdenum at the Endako Mine. These have not changed since Centerra's acquisition of the Thompson Creek Metals in 2016. As previously mentioned by Paul, our current focus is on issuing a prefeasibility on a potential restart of the Thompson Creek Mine in Q3 2023. As you will know, the Thompson Creek Mine has an overall average grade compared a higher overall average grade compared to Endako. And historically, the Thompson Creek Mine operated at a lower unit cost per pound of Moly. When we issued the Thompson Creek Mine prefeasibility, we plan to provide an update on the reserves and resources.Moving on to Slide 14. A brief overview of our Moly Business Unit and there are 3 components: The Thompson Creek Mine currently under care and maintenance with a restart under evaluation and a prefeasibility currently under preparation. The Endako Mine currently on care and maintenance with no medium-term plans for a restart given our focus on Thompson Creek and the Langeloth Metallurgical Facility based in Pittsburgh currently in operation. This facility purchases and processes third-party molybdenum concentrate from mines and upgrades this into molybdenum products to be sold predominantly to the U.S. steel and chemical markets. Under Thompson Creek Metals, Langeloth was fed by the Thompson Creek and Endako mines. This facility is also a part of our focus for the pre-feasibility assessment of a potential restart of the Thompson Creek Mine.And now I will pass on to Darren, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the financial highlights.Darren Millman: Thanks, Paul and good morning, all. For those following on the slide deck, I'll initially be speaking to Slide 16. Centerra recorded $208 million net revenue during the quarter, consisting of the Mount Milligan Mine and the Molybdenum Business Unit. No revenue was recorded at the ÃksÃ¼t Mine. At the Mount Milligan Mine, gold sales and copper sales were $67 million and $53 million, respectively. In the quarter, Mount Milligan sold 49,444 ounces of gold and 15.4 million pounds of copper. The ÃksÃ¼t Mine has no recorded sales or production in the quarter. We continue to hold distorted golden and carbon inventory of 100,000 recoverable ounces. The costs associated with the ÃksÃ¼t sold in carbon inventory is approximately $450 all-in-sustaining cost per ounce which is being capitalized as a current asset within inventory.Importantly, this quarter, we are highlighting our additional 200,000 ounces in heap leach pad and stockpiles that will be subsequently processed once we return to operational status at the ÃksÃ¼t Mine. At the Molybdenum Business Unit of approximately 4 million pounds of molybdenum was sold, generating $87 million with an average market price in the quarter of $21.49 per pound on molybdenum. During the quarter, the Molybdenum Business Unit generated $8.6 million in free cash flow with a focused effort on reducing inventory levels. During the quarter, that Mount Milligan Mine operations average gold price realized was $1,352 per ounce and $3.43 per pound of copper. This incorporates the existing stream arrangement over the mine. Cash used in operating activities by operations was approximately $10 million for the quarter and generated $25 million in free cash flow -- sorry, $25 million free cash flow deficit in the quarter.As noted in the MD&amp;A, the Mount Milligan Mine generated $26 million in positive free cash flow and $16 million in free cash flow for the quarter. For the year, the Mount Milligan Mine generated over $100 million in free cash flow. As noted by Paul, another strong operational performance at Mount Milligan Mine with record annual throughput at the mill. Given no sales occurred in the ÃksÃ¼t Mine in the quarter with operations continuing, we had $16 million used from treasury. This is a reduction from the previous quarter at $23 million as a result of reduction in activities at the site. The net loss from continued operation was $130.1 million in the quarter, with $13.7 million in adjusted net loss per quarter. The earnings in the quarter attributable to operations were $30 million contributed from the Mount Milligan Mine, a $3.4 million loss on the ÃksÃ¼t Mine and a $5 million loss from the Molybdenum Business Unit.For the quarter, there were 3 adjusting items, the Kemess impairment loss of $138 million net of tax, deferred income tax recovery of $14 million resulting from the underlying tax base adjustment of the ÃksÃ¼t Mine and $4.4 million noncash gain on derecognition of past employee health plan at the Langeloth facility. This was in connection with the spending of the union workforce with no future commitments on the plan. On the Kemess impairment loss, as the company and its technical team of focus on the delivery of the prefeasibility and the potential restart of the Thompson Creek Mine in Q3 2023 together with the delivery of the initial resource of the Goldfield by midyear, there has been no resources, financial or otherwise committed to the Kemess Project.Given this was a similar status at the end of 2021, this has resulted in an impairment indicator under IFRS 16 with a subsequent impairment assessment occurring in Q4 and reclassification of the Kemess Project as a noncore asset. The impairment consists of 2 components: a value and per instituted gold equivalent ounces and evaluation of capital equipment outside if you refer to Note 7 of the financial segments for further detail. The all-in sustaining costs reported for the quarter was relatively high compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily driven by lower copper production in Q4 and thus resulting in lower copper credits. Paul has explained this earlier with the ore presented to the mill in Q4 being high gold grade, low copper grade.I would highlight also in 2022, all our operating cost metrics were either within guidance or perform better in the 2022 guidance range previously provided. Now I will be speaking to Slide 17. For the full year, Centerra produced 244,000 ounces of gold and 74 million pounds of copper. Given the inventory levels at ÃksÃ¼t tunnel restart, recent operational performance, we are well placed as we move into 2023. In Q4, we returned $23 million to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks with a total of $60 million in returns to shareholders in 2022. And in early February, we initiated changes to the streamlined and corporate structure and reduced workforce levels at regional and corporate office with an average with an overall 20% reduction in headcount of.The company has exited 2022 with a cash balance of $532 million and over $900 million in liquidity. Given our strong financial position, the Board has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share. Those are my closing comments.

If successful, the six-reactor, 462 megawatt Carbon Free Power Project will run in 2030.NuScale said in January the target price for power from the plant is $89 per megawatt hour, up 53% from the previous estimate of $58 per MWh, a jump that raised concerns about whether customers would be willing to pay for the power it generates.But the consortium of cities in Utah, Idaho, New Mexico and Nevada called Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, or UAMPS, greenlighted the project's budget and finance plan with 26 of 27 approving.The consortium originally had 30 members but threedropped outstarting in 2020 amid rising costs and delays.The next step, an application to construct and operate the plant, is expected to be submitted to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission early next year.Mason Baker, the UAMPS chief executive and general manager, said the cities felt the project remained viable because rising prices for steel, copper, and cable were not unique to NuScale.""The project will support our decarbonization efforts, complement and enable more renewable energy, and keep the grid stable,"" Baker said. ""It will produce steady, carbon-free energy for 40 years or longer.Backers of next generation nuclear power technologies, including the Biden administration, believe small modular reactors can be built quickly once scaled and will be crucial in curbing climate change.Critics say the technology is too expensive compared to renewable energy and energy storage and that the reactors will produce radioactive waste, a problem that has boosted costs for traditional nuclear plants.The U.S. Department of Energy in 2020 approved $1.35 billion over 10 years for the project, subject to congressional appropriations.

The combination of Zoetis’ leadership in animal health and experience in forging broad collaborations in emerging markets will allow us to accelerate the advancement of animal health in the region,"" said Kristin Peck, Chief Executive Officer of Zoetis. ""Access to medicines and technology will help farmers raise healthier animals, improve productivity and secure more sustainable revenue, which is critical to the economic development and well-being of the region and its population.""Story continuesA.L.P.H.A. Plus will focus on dairy and beef production, poultry and aquaculture in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, and now extend to include Kenya, Ivory Coast and five additional markets from East, West and Central Sub-Saharan Africa.Drawing on the success of the company’s first A.L.P.H.A. initiative, which began in 2017 in Uganda, Nigeria, and Ethiopia, and later expanded into Tanzania, the new grant will seek to further animal health and farmers’ livelihoods through enhanced training – with a target to train 100,000 stakeholders by 2025. There will be a strong focus on gender diversity, including women-led, female-only training courses optimally designed to maximize attendance. The grant will also enable Zoetis to further develop distribution and training models for ‘last mile’ networks, build disease diagnostic services through laboratory networks in cooperation with public and private local partners, as well as develop outcomes research and digital services.Expanding and improving access to veterinary medicines, vaccines and services are essential for animal health, nutrition, and an inclusive, sustainable economy – and therefore a key pillar of the initiative.Exploring opportunities to scale up fish production in the regionThrough the initiative, Zoetis will explore opportunities to accelerate and increase fish production in Lake Victoria and Lake Volta, using expertise through our aquatic health business PHARMAQ to help understand the veterinary and productivity requirements of small-scale fish producers in Sub-Saharan Africa.With tilapia being one of the fastest growing animal protein sources in emerging markets, facilitating its geographic expansion and scalability can have a significant, positive impact on sustainable nutrition and economic growth in the region.As one of the most rapidly developing regions in the world, Sub-Saharan Africa is also home to some of the largest livestock populations in the world, and the highest density of impoverished livestock farmers.1 Livestock are an essential asset to rural communities, and consequently animal health is critical to achieving food security in areas of exceptionally high animal and human disease incidence.Through A.L.P.H.A. Plus, co-funded by Zoetis and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Zoetis will collaborate with governmental authorities, local veterinary associations, national and international NGOs, farmer associations and the public and private sector to maximize its positive impact in the region.Over the course of the five-year program, Zoetis will build on the progress and key learnings from the initial A.L.P.H.A. initiative, to deliver a long-term sustainable business model and animal health infrastructure for livestock farmers in the wider Sub-Saharan Africa region.In October, Zoetis was named to Fortune’s 2022 Change the World list, a global ranking of the top 50 companies making a positive social impact through business practices, based on the company’s African Livestock Productivity and Health Advancement (A.L.P.H.A.) initiative.

Armando Pimentel, who held executive roles in finance at NextEra for more than a decade before retiring in 2019, is coming back in what investors hope will mark the end of FP&amp;L's era of political and campaign-finance scandals.""They probably chose him to be a steady the ship-type figure,"" said Jack Dearing, an analyst with Washington-based Capstone LLC, which advises investors and companies on policy issues.Pimentel replaces outgoing FP&amp;L CEO Eric Silagy, who joined NextEra roughly two decades ago, worked as a top lobbyist for the company and has been at the center of some of its publicity problems.Since 2020, Florida-based news organizations have reported about FP&amp;L's role in questionable political and campaign finance-related activity.In one Orlando Sentinel article, Silagy was accused of working with a political consultant to harass a Democratic state senator who introduced legislation unfavorable to FP&amp;L. The Miami Herald and others reported claims that company executives worked with a consultant to derail certain state senate candidates and surveil a journalist who wrote critically about the regulated utility. Shares of NextEra sank late last month by nearly 9%, their biggest daily drop in more than two years, after the company abruptly announced Silagy would retire under the threat of a formal investigation by the Federal Election Commission into the company's political giving.An internal NextEra investigation found no wrongdoing, executives on the company's latest earnings call said, adding that Silagy's departure was unrelated to any controversies. Pimentel has been a well-known but low-key power industry figure whose familiarity with NextEra suggests he will provide consistent leadership for with NextEra's top subsidiary, said Glenrock Associates utility analyst Paul Patterson. ""I don't expect much of a change, leaving aside all of the stuff going on with the outgoing CEO,"" Patterson said. ""I don't think you're going to see any headlines like that (with Pimentel)."" Pimentel was CEO of NextEra Energy Resources, the company's unregulated arm focused on renewable power, for eight years before retiring in 2019. He was previously chief financial officer of NextEra Energy, a partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche and an accounting fellow at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Story continuesA former NextEra colleague of Pimentel's, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Pimentel was a ""straightforward, fact-based and driven"" coworker with a calm temperament. He helped build NextEra Energy Resources and seemed to choose his retirement as opposed to being forced out, the former colleague said.""We have welcomed Armando Pimentel back to our company and have confidence that he will use his deep industry and company experience to further strengthen the FPL organization,” NextEra Energy spokesperson David Reuter said.An early adopter of renewable power generation, NextEra is the third-largest U.S. energy company by market capitalization behind Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The company was trading well above its peers before news that Silagy would leave his post this month and depart the company in mid-May. Some critics of Florida Power &amp; Light, like Alissa Jean Schafer of watchdog group Energy Policy Institute, have welcomed Pimentel's uneventful background. But it will be take more than a change of guard for the utility to shake off the scandals that took place under Silagy, said Schafer. ""Even if you put somebody who is a perfectly fine individual with a financial background and doesn't have this aggressive history... it doesn't necessarily make up for the fact of all that did happen in very recent history,"" Schafer said.(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI.  ""The National Composite declined by -0.8% in December, and now stands 4.4% below its June peak.  For 2022 as a whole, the National Composite rose by 5.8%, the 15th best performance in our 35-year history, although obviously well below 2021's record-setting 18.9% gain.  We could record similar observations in the 10- and 20-City Composites.Story continues""Prices fell in all 20 cities in December, with a median decline of -1.1%.  Moreover, for all 20 cities, year-over-year gains in December (median 4.4%) were lower than those of November (median 6.4%). We noted last month that home prices in San Francisco had fallen on a year-over-year basis.  San Francisco's decline worsened in December (-4.2% year-over-year); its west coast neighbors Seattle (-1.8%) and Portland (+1.1%) once again form the bottom of the league table.""As was the case last month, December's best performers were all in the Southeast, with Miami (+15.9%) in the lead for the fifth straight month.  Tampa (+13.9%) and Atlanta (+10.4%) continued in second and third place, with Charlotte (+9.9%) not far behind.  Unsurprisingly, the Southeast (+12.5%) and South (+11.6%) were the strongest regions, and the West (+1.2%) continuing as the weakest.""The prospect of stable, or higher, interest rates means that mortgage financing remains a headwind for home prices, while economic weakness, including the possibility of a recession, may also constrain potential buyers. Given these prospects for a challenging macroeconomic environment, home prices may well continue to weaken.""SUPPORTING DATATable 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrentIndexLevelDateLevelDateFromPeak (%)LevelFromTrough (%)FromPeak (%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %294.68119.9 %59.6 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %298.70122.8 %44.6 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %310.64112.1 %37.3 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for December 2022.

Rates would then fall to 6.5% within 12 months, the poll showed.In January, when compared with the previous month, the IMACEC index rose 0.5%, the central bank said.The year-on-year results was explained by services and mining, which were partly offset by a drop in trade, while the monthly increase was driven by basically all groups surveyed, it added. The IMACEC accounts for nearly 90% of the South American country's GDP. (Reporting by Fabian Andres Cambero and Gabriel Araujo; Editing by Steven Grattan)]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Inc. (MA), Raytheon Technologies Corp. and BP. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Mastercard’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+3.2% vs. -2.3%). The company’s numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow in addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.Mastercard’s growing footprint in the crypto universe can position it for long-term growth. It is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows MA to pursue acquisitions and deploy capital.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Raytheon Technologies have gained +7.6% over the past six months against the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry’s gain of +10.6%. The company continues to receive ample orders for its combat-proven defense products. A steady recovery in commercial air traffic continues to boost commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for Raytheon. The stock holds a solid solvency position.However, economic sanctions imposed by governments in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might hurt Raytheon. A comparative analysis of its trailing 12-month Price/Book ratio indicates a relatively gloomy picture, which might be a cause for investors’ concern. The appreciating U.S. dollar has been burdening airlines, which may hurt the stock.(You can read the full research report on Raytheon Technologies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)BP’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+41.1% vs. +20.2%). The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, backing impressive production growth. It boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects was met successfully.BP set an aggressive energy transition plan to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy. Although there is no production from its Russia incorporated joint ventures, BP is projecting higher upstream volumes this year. Before reporting its December-quarter results, the energy major is willing to complete an additional $2.5 billion in share buy-backs.However, the leading integrated energy company’s balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 7.5% loss over the past four weeks.Shares of McEwen Mining Inc. have gained following the announcement that Nuton LLC, a Rio Tinto RIO Venture will make an additional $30 million investment in MUX’s subsidiary  McEwen Copper Inc..Per the agreement, Nuton will acquire shares of McEwen Copper in a two-part transaction which consists a private placement of 350,000 McEwen Copper common shares and purchase of 1,250,000 common shares owned by McEwen Mining in a secondary sale. Proceeds of the subscription and purchase are expected to be around $6.5 million to McEwen Copper and $23.5 million McEwen Mining, respectively.The proceeds of the private placement will be used to advance development of the Los Azules copper project in San Juan, Argentina, and for general corporate purposes. After closing of deal, which is expected by Mar 10, 2023, Nuton will own 14.2% of McEwen Copper on a fully diluted basis, and McEwen Mining will own 51.9%.This gold and silver mining company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +54%. Revenues are expected to be $29.4 million, down 16% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For McEwen, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on MUX going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.Story continuesThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We believe technology can transform industries, businesses, communities and individual lives, and I am proud of our contributions and progress towards this effort this year.With this report, I would like to introduce our new Purposeful Innovation Framework - guiding our decisions and 2025 Corporate Responsibility goals as we use technology to positively impact how we live, work and thrive. It lays out three strategic areas of focus: Empowering Digital Transformation, Acting Responsibly and Operating Sustainably. I provide highlights of each below, and I encourage you to read the full report to learn more about our commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts.Empowering Digital TransformationThe past year marked an important evolution in our long-term vision of enabling a world where everyone and everything is intelligently connected. We remain focused on transitioning Qualcomm from a wireless communications company for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. Our one technology roadmap is allowing us to efficiently scale and diversify our leading technologies across new industries, applications and experiences - accelerating digital transformation and changing the world for the greater good. Our breakthrough innovations - including advanced connectivity, high-performance low-power processing, AI-accelerated solutions and more - can help tackle the world's biggest challenges and enable society to leap forward into the digital era.The broad digital transformation at the edge will have a profound impact and we believe everyone deserves the opportunity to participate in this intelligently connected future. We are addressing this imperative to bridge the digital divide by working with a broad ecosystem to deploy advanced technology and solutions at scale and bring programs that strengthen economic and social development to underserved communities globally. Providing everyone with reliable fixed or mobile internet connectivity is a major first step in creating greater access to quality education, entrepreneurial and employment opportunities, health care and other services.Story continuesActing ResponsiblyAt Qualcomm, we believe that breakthrough innovation depends on the collective effort of the best and brightest minds. Teams that bring a wealth of backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and skillsets are the driving force behind our innovation, strategy and success. An inclusive and inspiring workplace - where everyone is welcome and has the opportunity to succeed - provides the foundation to further expand diverse talent and develop our future leaders. This year, I signed Disability:IN's CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion, to continue advancing equality and inclusion and to serve as a positive example for CEOs and organizations globally.As part of our commitment to championing and empowering our people, we continue to make progress on our 2025 goals. We increased our representation of women in leadership1 by more than 7 percent, our representation of underrepresented minorities (URM2 ) leadership by more than 5 percent and our overall representation of URMs by more than 12 percent, since 2020. Further, we understand the importance of developing a pipeline of highly skilled science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) innovators. In 2022, we achieved our 2025 goal to engage 1.5 million students and teachers across the globe. But our work and our efforts don't stop there. As technology and innovation continue to drive a more connected world, it is imperative that we remain steadfast in our commitment to inspiring the next generation of inventors.Operating SustainablyWe also see our advanced technologies playing an essential role in enabling efficiencies through digital transformation. Connected vehicles will help reduce congestion and pollution. Smart factories will be able to deploy flexible manufacturing lines to improve productivity and energy use. And precision agriculture will enable farmers to optimize the use of water and fertilizer to mitigate waste and reduce environmental impact. In our own operations, we are doing our part as well.Last year, to reflect our belief that environmental sustainability is imperative for our collective future, we announced our plans to achieve net-zero global emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040 and committed to the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5°C. During our first full year of implementing this strategy, we've already made progress by reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 4 percent, with a total reduction of 28 percent since 2014. We also joined The Climate Pledge, a cross-sector community of companies committed to be net-zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement's goals. Further, we engaged with our suppliers to tackle value chain emission reductions in a collaborative and open manner.In recognition of the positive impact our technology can have on society, we are proud to be included in the Fortune Change the World list for the third time since 2019. The list recognizes companies that are making important social or environmental impacts through innovative business strategies. We are also pleased to be acknowledged, once again, for our leading ESG performance and disclosures in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index and Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies. Additional awards and recognitions can be found in the Our Awards and Recognitions section of this report.We believe in making the world smarter, more connected and more sustainable. We will continue to build on our progress and remain centered around purposeful innovation to create a better future for everyone.Learn more in Qualcomm's 2022 Corporate Responsibility ReportQualcomm, Tuesday, February 28, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/741213/Message-from-Our-CEO-Qualcomm-2022-Corporate-Responsibility-Report]"

But a new report out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says the investment isn’t enough to keep competing countries like China from overtaking America’s position as the leader in advanced technologies.“If we don't have [competitive advantage], then U.S. firms are gonna lose out on contracts, on bids, on other things that we really care about that make U.S. firms more prosperous and the people in the United States more prosperous as well,” Neil Thompson, director of the MIT FutureTech Research Project and study lead, told Yahoo Finance.Congress passed the CHIPS, or Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America, Act in July. The Commerce Department is getting set to announce how companies can apply for funds from the multi-billion project, which is aimed at bringing more semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. and incentivizing firms to research cutting edge technologies that will give American companies an edge over international rivals.U.S. President Joe Biden visits Viasat Inc., a technology company that will benefit from the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, in Carlsbad, California, U.S., November 4, 2022. (Image: Reuters/Mike Blake)Thompson, however, says that while the CHIPS Act is certainly helpful, it doesn’t address the litany of other shortfalls that are hurting America’s competitiveness.“Computing is...about having those computers, it's about having…ever better algorithms that you can run on those chips,” Thompson said. “It's about having the best people working on those things, and for U.S. companies and U.S. universities making those discoveries. So we need to have a broader approach to making sure that we are at the forefront of all of those things, not just making sure that we are sort of at the frontier with chips.”US President Joe Biden, with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger (L), arrives to speaks about rebuilding US manufacturing through the CHIPS and Science Act at the groundbreaking of the new Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility near New Albany, Ohio, on September 9, 2022. (Image: Saul Loeb / AFP)According to the MIT report, a 2019 survey of ​​120 U.S. organizations including universities, national labs, and federal agencies found that 79% of respondents believe China is improving its ability to compete at a better rate than America.Story continuesCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo says the government hopes to use funding from the CHIPS Act to build two chip manufacturing clusters in the U.S. The idea is to ensure that the country is able to both research and develop its own semiconductors.America used to be the leader in chip manufacturing, or fabrication, as it’s known, but it now builds just 12% of the world’s semiconductors. The CHIPS Act could help turn that around, bringing more manufacturing capabilities back to the U.S.The government has also taken steps to limit China’s ability to access high-end American technologies, creating a list of Chinese companies that U.S. firms can’t ship their products to out of fear that it will be used to assist the Chinese military.But according to Thompson, the U.S. needs to do more than simply build chips and restrict China’s access to them. It also needs to ensure that the country has the capabilities necessary to develop new kinds of computer algorithms that help businesses improve their overall efficiency.So how does he suggest building on the promises of the CHIPS Act? Part of the solution, he says, is to ensure the U.S. has enough immigrants to help fill important roles in the tech industry.“We need to be graduating the best folks, we need to be giving them a pathway so that they can stay in the United States,” Thompson said. “That's an area where we're not doing very well right now, in terms of being restrictive. And so this is another example where the CHIPS Act is good, but it's only one piece of what we need if we want to be at the forefront of advanced computing.”If the government and American businesses manage to come together, the country should be able to hold on to its lead in the tech industry, Thompson said. If not, China will likely grab the lead and its businesses and military will supplant the U.S. as the top dog on the international stage.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.More from DanNvidia is tying its future to AI at just the right timeThere's no going back on A.I.: 'The genie is out of the bottle'ChatGPT is less than a year old, but one expert says this A.I. model is 'peaking'Got a tip?

168,0c6ead10-c106-3319-9f0b-d289ff697fef,QCOM,2023-03-01,QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) insiders sold US$2.2m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-incorporated-nasdaq-qcom-insiders-130017947.html,1677589217,STORY,['QCOM'],"[In the last year, many QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies, James Thompson, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$132 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$123. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year QUALCOMM insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At QUALCOMM Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at QUALCOMM. Specifically, insiders ditched US$1.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. QUALCOMM insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$173m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About QUALCOMM Insiders?Insiders sold QUALCOMM shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, QUALCOMM makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of QUALCOMM.But note: QUALCOMM may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Previously, Expedia, Orbitz and Hotels.com had disparate loyalty schemes. At Expedia’s vacation rental brand, Vrbo, it would be the first time it gets included in a loyalty program.This will be somewhat of a transition year for Vrbo, and Expedia is leveraging several tools at its disposal that it hopes to wield to advantage to compete against Airbnb, which by one measure, is 2.6 times the size of Vrbo. Expedia doesn’t break out Vrbo’s financials, but said that at the end of 2022, it had around $1.8 billion in guest deposits for future Vrbo bookings. Airbnb had $4.8 billion.Expedia Group plans to do at least three things to grow its Vrbo business in 2023.CEO Peter Kern told an investor conference Monday that Vrbo would be the last of its core brands, including Expedia and Hotels.com, to transition to a consolidated front-end tech stack this year, and when that’s completed Vrbo would see an acceleration of engineering tests and potentially product development. The Group’s game-plan is also to “wire” Vrbo into Expedia Group’s partnership business, and to get cross-brand benefits from the new loyalty program.Story continuesKern noted that once the Vrbo migration into the unified tech stack occurs, then engineers would be freed from those labors to focus on testing and product innovation. “And you start to get acceleration, less drag and you don’t need to invest more in product because we have tons of engineers, tons of product people, and now they’re all working on one stack and they’re working faster and they’re going to get more efficient,” Kern said. “So more efficiency, I’d say, in the cost line relatively speaking and greater acceleration on the top line for that.”Of course, that’s assuming the tech transition goes smoothly.“I think what’s different about Vrbo is not so much the product suite or whatever,” Kern said. “Of course, it will benefit from being on the Expedia stack. It will benefit from being part of One Key [the pending new loyalty program]. Those are really big benefits. It will also benefit from being able to be wired into our B2B business, right?”Expedia’s has the largest — or among the largest — business-to-business segments in travel, and that’s not a space that Airbnb plays in much, if at all. In 2022, Expedia’s business-to-business segment grew 74 percent to $2.5 billion in revenue — about 22 percent of the Group’s total.“We have this very big B2B business where we power banks and OTAs (online travel agencies), offline travel agents, all kinds of things, which Vrbo has only been barely wired into because of a lot of technical constraints as again, we get everything on one stack and all of this product gets easier to use, we can pipe that through to a bunch of these third-party demand sites essentially,” Kern said. “And that’s a real advantage for us relative to our competitors.”Of course, Expedia Group, like Booking Holdings, is disadvantaged by pay to play loyalty programs, which Airbnb doesn’t have to deal with. Kudos to Airbnb for building a brand that is not loyalty reward-scheme dependent. There are not many big brands in the travel industry that can take a pass on loyalty incentives.Airbnb has another advantage too, among many. It will benefit from a traveler return to cities, where Vrbo is under-indexed. That’s travel industry jargon meaning Vrbo is stronger in resort locations than in urban centers.In BriefDistressed Inventory Brings No Stress to Vacation Rental Bargain HuntersStartups such as Getawaygogo and Whimstay are making a mark in helping property managers get heads in beds at a discount at vacation rentals that would otherwise go unoccupied. Will companies like these first-movers become the Pricelines and Hotwire’s of the short-term rental industry?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Kroger (KR) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.90 a share two days away from its upcoming earnings release on March 2, 2023.KR has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.96%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.90 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.89.KR is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Expedia (EXPE).Expedia, which is readying to report earnings on May 1, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.05 a share, and EXPE is 62 days out from its next earnings report.For Expedia, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.08 is 163.49%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, KR and EXPE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

171,f3321510-956b-345a-9a8b-ad46ef7eee9b,LMT,2023-03-01,15 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-airplane-manufacturing-companies-030452916.html,1677639892,STORY,"['BA', 'TXT', 'LMT', 'ERJ', 'GE']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest airplane manufacturing companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the World. When it comes to high technology, the aircraft industry ranks right at the top of the food chain, alongside semiconductor fabrication and astronautics. The modern day jet aircraft - whether civilian or military - has hundreds of thousands of parts which are often shipped from all over the world for final assembly into the beast that takes to the skies.Naturally, this amount of complexity makes for high barriers to entry into the industry and leaves only a handful of firms that are able to make and sell airplanes. Due to their size, jets also take months to assemble and end up costing millions of dollars. This high cost also makes the aircraft manufacturing industry one of the most lucrative in the world - and one which sees little threat from new entrants. For instance, a research report from Polaris Market Research outlines that the aircraft manufacturing market was worth $413 billion in 2021 and that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.7% between then and 2030 to be worth an estimated $626 billion by the end of the forecast period.As is the case with nearly every high tech industry, perhaps except semiconductors, Polaris Market Research also highlights that North America was the largest aircraft manufacturing market in 2021 with a large demand for next generation airplanes fueling the growth. However, despite being the largest, North America will not be the fastest growing sector, as this title will go to Asia Pacific which is fueled by the growing populations of India and China spurring demand and increasing the need for planes to fly people around.The aircraft industry is also evolving, with new manufacturing and computing technologies providing companies the opportunity to improve their operations. One interesting innovation that has made its way to the manufacturing line is the use of smart glasses. These are eyewear that comes equipped with digital displays and provides the assembly technician useful inputs throughout their activities. For instance, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which is one of the world's largest aircraft manufacturers, has found that using these wearables in its wire harness assembly has enabled it to reduce production time by a massive 25%. Boeing is not the only one that uses smart glasses in the aircraft supply chain. One of the world's most advanced jet engine manufacturers, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), has been researching their use since 2017 and found that not only did the mechanics who are responsible for tightening nuts on fuel lines see their productivity improve by 8% due to smart glasses but that 85% of those surveyed said that they reduced errors and 60% preferred using the wearables.Story continuesAnother trend in the industry is the push towards sustainable aviation fuels since air travel is among the leading sources of carbon dioxide emissions. On this front, Boeing announced in February 2023 that it plans to procure 5.6 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel for its 2023 flight operations, more than doubling last year's procurement and accounting for a quarter of the aerospace giant's total fuel needs. Not to be left behind, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is looking at the future as it is designing aircraft that reduce fuel use through their airframe. NASA's Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project aims to invest $425 million with Boeing over seven years as part of the White House's Climate Action Plan.At the same time, demand for conventional aviation is also booming, with Boeing's chief executive officer (CEO) Mr. Matt Welch sharing an update during the firm's fourth quarter of 2022 earnings call held in January 2023. Mr. Welch sounded optimistic about his company's future, sharing that demand was strong across Boeing's portfolio, as he explained that:On the order front and on the market side, we continue to see very strong demand across the portfolio. More than 800 net orders on the year, driven by the 737 MAX and the 787, highlighted most recently by the very historic deal with UAL, United Airlines in December. In 2022, we sold 200-plus net wide bodies. That’s the most since 2018. More broadly, the 737 MAX team has made tremendous progress. Fleet is performing exceptionally well. Production is stabilizing, demand is strong. We delivered 1,000-plus 737 MAXs in total now. And since our return to service, the fleet has surpassed 3 million flight hours. It’s safe and it’s the most reliable of the airplane fleets. Production, we’ve all gone from 0 to 31 a month and we’re prioritizing stability, which we have not yet achieved, but we’re on a steady course to do so.And orders, more than 1,500 gross orders to date. 737 MAX returning to service in China is another indication of this overall improvement in our business. This month, of course, we all know that, that occurred. We have more airplanes on the Tarmac in China to bring back into service just as we did here in the U.S. before we began any deliveries of any sort.The Boeing chief also shared the cheer flowing through his as NASA launched the SLS rocket (built by Boeing) to the Moon last year, and stated:Our SLS launch. This was an enormous emotional upper for our company and for our team broadly. The Artemis 1 launch in November, which was powered by the SLS rocket was more than a little inspiring.Today, we'll look at some of the biggest aircraft manufacturing companies in the world. One of these, unsurprisingly, is Boeing, while the others include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China.15 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the WorldOur Methodology As a starting point for our list, we first listed all publicly traded companies that make planes and selected them through market capitalization.

H3X designs and manufactures advanced electric motors to enable sustainable aviation and other high-performance applications. This latest funding brings the total raised by H3X to $9M.The investment will be used to accelerate technology development and commercialization of H3X’s HPDM family of integrated motor drives and the scale-up of their new headquarters facility in Louisville, Colorado for production.""At H3X, we are building integrated motor drives from 30kW to 3MW that are unparalleled in performance in terms of specific power (kW/kg) and efficiency,"" according to Jason Sylvestre, Co-Founder and CEO of H3X. ""We are thrilled to have support from Lockheed Martin and are excited for the opportunity to work together and collaborate on next-generation defense technology using our motors.""""H3X is working on scaling transformative technologies that we believe have the potential to provide our customer with viable options for electrifying legacy, all-domain systems and components,"" said Chris Moran, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Ventures. ""Our investment in H3X reinforces Lockheed Martin’s commitment to developing predictive capabilities and scaling solutions that allow the U.S. and its allies to stay ahead of threats.""H3X has made advancements in several different areas that enable them to reach continuous specific powers of &gt;10kW/kg and best-in-class efficiency. These areas include electromagnetics, material science, power electronics, additive manufacturing, motor control, and thermals. H3X has invested heavily in vertical integration and does design, manufacturing, and testing in-house at their headquarters in Louisville, Colorado.Story continuesH3X originally developed this technology to enable compelling fully-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft with excellent range and payload capacity while also significantly reducing noise and operational costs. ""When you look at the power density and efficiency requirements that are needed for electrifying narrow-body jets, there really isn’t anything out there that is sufficient,"" said Jason Sylvestre. ""The Megawatt-class systems that you can buy today still use technology from the last century and are far too large, heavy, and inefficient to meet the demanding requirements of electric aviation."" Additionally, H3X has found that there are a number of other markets that can also benefit from their technology including defense, marine, specialized ground vehicles, and power generation.H3X currently has three base products, the HPDM-30, the HPDM-250, and the HPDM-3000. These three units all utilize the same core technology and range in power from 30kW to 3MW. Additionally, the core technology they’ve developed is scalable and modular and can be used to build highly integrated, aerospace-grade solutions that are tailored to match specific customer requirements.About H3XFounded in 2020 by a team of multidisciplinary engineers, H3X is an advanced technology and electric motor manufacturing company based in Denver, Colorado.

(PHM): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pultegroup-inc-140002382.html,1677592802,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has lost 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $1.78 per share, indicating a change of -2.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 points to a change of -32% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 indicates a change of -0.1% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -11.7%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.27 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.09 billion and $14.06 billion estimates indicate -13.2% and -0.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $5.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $3.63 for the same period compares with $2.51 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +12.33%. The EPS surprise was +26.04%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most profitable companies in the world.There is a great divide in the finance world between revenue, growth and profit. Often times, the focus is on companies who either have already demonstrated significant, or in most cases, companies which have the potential for massive growth in the future, as that will lead to a greater valuation and hence, a greater return for shareholders. Growth here refers to revenue growth and often, targets are set based on expected revenue in the future based on various analytics and data. When a company is newly incorporated with great potential, even though revenue continues to increase significantly year on year, it is generally loss making except in some specific circumstances, due to a lack of economies of scale and high fixed costs and capital investment. Therefore, at this juncture, it is generally the gross margin, or revenue less cost of goods sold, which show the variable profit of a company, which is considered to be an important metric, even though revenue growth is still perhaps the most important factor at this stage.25 most profitable companies in the worldNAR studio/Shutterstock.comHowever, for shareholders of major companies, both public and profit, net profit is one of the most important metrics to consider, which shows the profit of a company after all expenses have been deducted, including both variable and fixed costs, not to mention other expenses such as interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Net profit is what goes to shareholders in the form of dividends, though the majority of their return comes from an increase in the value of the company.One amazing example of a company focusing on growth instead of revenue early on, and which was one of the most profitable companies in the world according to Forbes Global 2000, is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). When Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) started out, for several years, it was a lossmaking company even as its revenue saw outstanding growth and the company dominated the online retailer industry. The company adopted a policy of providing extremely low prices to attract customers and driving out competitors while hemorrhaging money, as losses continued to pile up. It took Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) 14 years to make as much profit as it did finally in the last quarter in 2018. Now, it is easily one of the biggest companies in the world as its dominance only continues to improve, with Jeff Bezos's policy of growth over meeting quarterly earnings targets achieved great success in the long term. Many other companies, though, are not so lucky, as consistently making losses is not generally a viable strategy long term.Story continuesHowever, in this ever-advancing world, profit is no longer the only important consideration for shareholder; environmental, social and governance (ESG) has made its mark, which is why some of the most profitable companies in the world also have a lot in common with the biggest ESG companies in the world. Considering the negative impacts major companies have on the environment and climate change, there has been significant backlash against their practices, which is why companies have had to focus more on sustainability in addition to profits, and make significant investments to bring to fruition their ambitious ESG targets. While ESG was initiated decades ago, the world has started taking it much more seriously now, since the impact of climate change isn't just known, but is being felt across the world.To determine the most profitable companies in the world was not an easy task. To start off, we obtained profits on the top 2000 companies in the world courtesy of Forbes. We then filtered the 50 companies with the highest profits, and updated the profit figures based on the trailing twelve month profits from Yahoo Finance. Remember, even though some of them may have made losses recently, they are traditionally among the most profitable companies in this world, and hence, deserving of a place in this list. We have also only focused on net income from continuing operations to truly reflect a company's profitability. Some energy companies, as a result of the Russia Ukraine war and the increase in energy prices, have recorded their best ever profits in history and hence, jumped several places in this list. So, let's take a look at the companies which combined reported profits of well over $950 billion, starting with (all TTM net profit figures are in millions):25.

EBS reported an adjusted loss of 31 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2022, against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 32 cents. The reported earnings also missed our model estimate for earnings of 18 cents. In the year-ago quarter, EBS reported earnings of $4.50 per share.Revenues in the reported quarter were $330.7 million, down 54% from the prior-year period’s level. The revenue decline was caused by a reduction in COVID-related contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) revenues. Revenues beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $311.4 million.Shares of Emergent were down 5.0% in pre-market trading on Feb 28 following the earnings announcement. This was attributable to the significant deviation of earnings from Wall Street estimates. The stock has declined 66.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 11.8% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailTotal product sales decreased 30.0% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $305.7 million, owing to the year-over-year decreased sales of the Anthrax vaccine, Narcan nasal spray, ACAM2000 and other products. The decline was partially offset as the company started recording Tembexa product sales in fourth-quarter 2022.Sales of anthrax vaccines (BioThrax and AV7909) were $50.9 million in the reported quarter, down 63.0% year over year. This decline can be attributed to a decrease in deliveries of AV7909 to the U.S Government’s Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).Narcan (naloxone HCl) nasal spray added $91.1 million to product sales, down 24.0% year over year. The decline in sales was likely due to erosion in sales following the launch of a generic in December 2021. The downside was slightly offset by higher volumes of Narcan sprays sold to public interest customers in the United States and Canada.Following the acquisition of worldwide rights to Tembexa last September, the company added product sales of $117.6 million during the quarter.Story continuesEmergent did not report any product sales from its smallpox vaccine ACAM2000 in the fourth quarter. In the year-ago period, the company had recorded $125.8 million from ACAM2000 sales. This major deterioration was caused by the timing of deliveries to the U.S Government.Other product sales were $46.1 million, down 8% year over year.Revenues from contracts and grants plunged 90% year over year to $7.1 million.Total CDMO revenues reached $17.9 million, compared to the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $218.3 million. While CDMO services revenues declined 65.0% year over year to $17.7 million, CDMO lease revenues were $0.2 million, a substantial fall from the year-ago quarter revenue of $167.1 million.This significant decline in CDMO services revenues was due to no combined revenues from AstraZeneca AZN and Janssen, a Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ subsidiary, during the quarter.In July 2020, J&amp;J and Emergent entered into an agreement to provide contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services for J&amp;J’s single-shot, adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine for five years. In June 2022, the companies announced their decision to terminate the deal, citing contract breaches.The decline in CDMO lease revenues was largely due to no revenues during the quarter from the lease components of the contracts with the Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (“CIADM”) and the J&amp;J-subsidiary Janssen.We note that Emergent suffered a setback in 2021 when there was a manufacturing mishap at its Bayview facility where COVID-19 vaccine ingredients of J&amp;J and AstraZeneca reportedly got mixed and led to several faulty batches of J&amp;J’s vaccine. Emergent lost its contract for AstraZeneca’s vaccine following the mishap.Emergent reported an adjusted EBITDA of $34.2 million for the fourth quarter, down 82% year over year.Full-Year ResultsEmergent reported revenues of $1.12 billion, down 37.0% year over year. The company reported an adjusted loss of $2.23 per share for 2022, against earnings of $6.02 in the year-ago period.2023 GuidanceEmergent has issued fresh guidance for total revenues, adjusted EBITDA and CDMO services. The company also revised the categories used in discussing product/service level revenues.The company expects to record full-year 2023 revenues in the range of $1.10-$1.20 billion. For first-quarter 2023, total revenue is expected to be between $130-$150 million.Management expects Anthrax Medical Countermeasures (Anthrax MCM) sales — comprising of AV7909, BioThrax, Anthrasil and raxibacumab — in the range of $260-$280 million. Revenues from the Narcan nasal spray are expected to be between $290-$310 million. Product sales from Smallpox MCM (comprising ACAM2000, Vigiv and Tembexa) are expected to add $235-$255 million to total revenues. The company expects to record $165-$185 million from other product sales.Emergent expects CDMO revenues to be in the range of $115-$135 million.Emergent also anticipates adjusted net income(loss) within $(80)-$(30) million.

Take this earnings season so far: References to AI and related terms during calls with investors are already up 77% from a year earlier.Most Read from BloombergSorry, Twitter. Elon Found His Next Shiny Object.How to Get a Free Flight to Hong Kong in 500,000 Airline Ticket GiveawayWorld’s Rich Take Advantage as $1 Trillion Property Market CratersMusk Was Right About Tesla Rivals Losing BillionsLightfoot Is First Chicago Mayor to Lose Reelection in 40 YearsIt's no wonder. AI-hungry investors have propelled Nvidia Corp., which makes the chips needed for complex AI computing tasks, into the best-performing stock among mega-caps this year. Relatively obscure firms with AI in their names have also skyrocketed. BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. has surged more than 300%, while C3.ai Inc. and BuzzFeed Inc. have more than doubled. Guardforce AI Co. is up 51%.A lot of the companies tossing around the phrase AI are just taking advantage of the hype. Some are speaking aspirationally about how they see AI transforming their businesses — one day, some day. And then there are the real, practical use cases for AI and machine learning that companies have been actively investing in, developing and using — in some cases, long before AI became a buzzword — proving that the power of these algorithms is already reaching far beyond chatbots to change everything from the way companies manage their parts inventories to how they're recruiting for job candidates.“It is impossible to quantify what the impact of AI could be and equally possible that a wave of enthusiasm carries stocks with expertise in or exposure to AI, no matter how tenuous, higher and higher,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell Plc. “All investors can do is stick to their disciplines and focus on competitive position, management, and valuation, while making sure that they truly understand the business, before they put any capital at risk.”Story continuesThe tech-focused Nasdaq 100 Index traded slightly lower at the open on Wednesday. The index is up nearly 10% this year, far exceeding gains in the S&amp;P 500 Index.Below is a look at how various companies and industries are using AI — largely based on commentary from this quarter's earnings calls but also some key announcements made in recent weeks:AdvertisingAlphabet Inc.’s Google is using large language models to strengthen its search engine, specifically by helping anticipate the intent of users' queries, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call Feb. 2. AI is also used to increase consumer interactions with ads. “AI has been foundational to our ads business for the last decade,” he said.During Meta Platforms Inc.'s own earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said AI is “the foundation of our discovery engine and ads business.” The company is investing more heavily in AI to develop privacy tools as well as help advertisers serve more ""relevant and engaging"" ads, he said. Some of those efforts are already paying off, with conversions, or an advertiser’s desired outcome from ads, increasing 20% in the last quarter compared with the prior year. Meta also uses AI for their content algorithms.AI has already become “fundamental” to WPP Plc, the world’s largest advertising group by revenue, said CEO Mark Read, adding that it can help find relevant audiences and measure the impact of the company’s work.SearchMicrosoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella said there’s a “sea change” happening in search. The company’s AI model, Prometheus, will allow it to make the biggest leap ever in the relevance of results, he said. Its new Bing search engine adds the ability to chat and can help users compose emails and other content. Google will integrate the underlying technology in its Bard chatbot into its own engine. CEO Sundar Pichai has said this will produce results that “distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats.”TranslationZoom Video Communications Inc. CEO Eric Yuan pledged to “layer more AI technologies into our products,” and touted new features like translation, video captioning and analysis for sales.Medical devices, research and testingIn its own call, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. highlighted that it hired Taha Kass-Hout, former vice president of machine learning and chief medical officer at Amazon.com Inc. The General Electric Co. spinoff is counting on Kass-Hout to lead its push for growth through improved machine-learning capabilities while it raises investment in digital services and software.One AI application the company specifically mentioned during its call with investors is an algorithm it offers to radiologists to help produce sharper images quicker. CEO Peter Arduini said the product has already reduced scan times for about 5.5 million patients globally. Another is a cardiac ultrasound product that uses AI to help assess heart muscle function.Medtronic Plc found its AI-assisted spinal surgery planning makes workflows “faster and more efficient,” CEO Geoffrey Martha said. The company’s adoption of AI to help physicians detect polyps in colonoscopies led to its gastrointestinal business growing in the ""high single-digits.""Charles River Laboratories International Inc. sees AI helping drug discovery, potentially by indicating whether a new drug will be as effective as an old one, said CEO James Foster.Medical testing center operator Quest Diagnostics Inc. said that it has begun using a highly automated microbiology lab system that leverages AI to analyze samples. CEO Jim Davis mentioned the platform in the company's earnings call when he was talking about ways in which it's trying to counter “significant inflation and wage pressures.”CybersecurityPalo Alto Networks Inc. CEO Nikesh Arora said the company has been using AI in its security services to prevent cyberattacks, and has done about $30 million in sales of its product that uses machine learning to detect threats.Product procurement, inventory and analysisFast food chain owner Yum! Brands Inc. uses AI to predict and recommend how much product restaurant managers should order each week for 3,000 of its U.S. Taco Bell and KFC locations. The aim is to reduce waste and transfers of inventory between stores. The company is working on a process to predict the quantity and time food should be cooked primarily in KFC restaurants, planning to pilot it in an international market.Home-improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. has given staff phones to compress dozens of systems into a simplified workflow and improve customer service, and the devices now include “Sidekick,” an app that uses machine learning to help employees prioritize tasks and know when inventory on shelves is running low.Tapestry Inc., owner of luxury brands like Coach and Kate Spade, highlighted new capabilities to use AI to forecast customer demand and curate its inventory. The analysis “helped to ensure our product was in the right place at the right time,” said CEO Joanne Crevoiserat.Caterpillar Inc., one the world's largest manufacturers of construction and mining equipment, is “investing heavily in AI,” CEO Jim Umpleby said. The company has for years been digitizing everything from bulldozers to diggers to get early alerts of problems and keep them from breaking down. Its system uses AI to better anticipate when a machine may break, and in some cases may automatically alert a dealer to provide a new part.Matching servicesAirbnb Inc. CEO Brian Chesky said AI can help the home-sharing company deal with the challenge of matching travelers to hosts when, unlike rooms in a hotel, every listing is unique. “If there's like 50,000 homes in a city, what's the right one for you?” he said. “That's less of a search problem than a matching problem, and I think that AI is going to be a really great opportunity for us.”Match Group Inc. CEO Bernard Kim said one way the company’s Tinder dating app “can really change the game is by leveraging machine learning to enhance recommendations.” The group already uses machine learning for safety and moderation, and its plan this year to expand its proficiency in the area will get a boost from its purchase of South Korea’s Hyperconnect, which brought with it a team with expertise in the area, he said.Hiring and talent acquisitionAt human resources consultant Robert Half International Inc., which has more than 30 million candidates in its database, Chief Financial Officer Michael Buckley said spending on AI will be “flattish” this year compared to 2022. AI has “transformed how we identify and select candidates,” and the company is working on how AI can identify leads for its sales professionals.Customer serviceWells Fargo &amp; Co. will start rolling out to customers an AI-powered virtual assistant called “Fargo” to personalize and simplify people’s banking experience, said CEO Charlie Scharf.CME Group Inc. agreed to a 10-year partnership with Google Cloud in 2021, using its data analytics and machine learning solutions to help CME provide clients with information and toolkits for developing models, algorithms and risk management, it said at the time. CEO Terrence Duffy said in early February the derivatives exchange operator doesn’t necessarily have to shell out to deliver AI for customers, as “we're able to get that through Google without having to make the investment ourselves.”VeriSign Inc., which provides domain registry services, said ChatGPT may enhance its NameStudio tool, which suggests alternatives if the name a consumer tries to register is already taken, said CEO Jim Bidzos.It's clear that not every company has embraced the AI hype with the same enthusiasm as the ones above. For every major company that mentioned AI in an earnings call this quarter, there were scores more that didn’t utter the phrase at all.Some companies, namely financial ones, have gone as far as to ban or restrict their employees' use of ChatGPT in particular. Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among those that have recently banned employees from using the chatbot.The clamor for everything AI bears hallmarks of the cryptocurrency frenzy that took Wall Street by storm a few years back, and more recently the metaverse. Only time will tell if investor interest will last longer than it did for those similarly untested concepts.For his part Matthew Kanterman, director of research at Roundhill Investments, sees some big differences between AI and other more short-lived bets.The returns from AI are “more tangible, more real,” he said. It's “happening right now.”--With assistance from Paul Jarvis, Julia Love, Brody Ford, Dina Bass, Kurt Wagner and Joe Deaux.(Updates Nasdaq 100’s performance this year in the fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMicrosoft Expands Game Pass as Regulators Fret Over Activision DealRussian Airlines Are Flying High Despite SanctionsGina Raimondo Becomes China Player in a Job Where Her Predecessor Used to NapThis Road Could Save the Planet—and Carve Up Alaskan WildernessThe NFL’s Top Talent Agency Bought by Venture Investors©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Income-generating stocks are all the rage as the stock market suffered huge losses last year. According to a report by Reuters, Wall Street recorded its biggest annual drop in 2022 since the financial crisis of 2008, as the S&amp;P 500 shed nearly $8 trillion in market cap. Growth stocks also recorded their worst performance in a decade, turning investors’ attention toward overlooked dividend equities.Quality companies that have raised their payouts for a significant period are considered safe during fluctuating market conditions. Historical analysis of these stocks shows that they have outperformed their peers when turbulence in the market occurs. Over the past five decades, dividend growers have surpassed other asset classes when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually, as reported by Sterling Capital. Another reason why dividends make reliable investments is due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. According to a report by Schroders, the average annual return across eight markets was 4.3% in the last 25 years, which increased to an average of 7.1% including reinvested dividends.Analysts often advise investing in companies that have proven track records of dividend growth, as these companies are likely to continue growing their payouts in the long term. In addition to this, such companies are considered less risky as they have stable cash flows and histories of profitability. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some major dividend companies with solid dividend growth streaks and strong balance sheets. In view of this, we will discuss the best consistent dividend stocks to buy in this article.Story continues16 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for at least 10 years.

(NYSE:WSM), worth over $305.3 million collectively.Voss Capital mentioned Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We believe shorting furniture retailers has arguably become a consensus view on the back of widely known tough comps from early 2021 (+26% and +40% SSS Comps for WSM in calendar Q1/Q2 ‘21) and fear of pull forward of demand, which seems to be corroborated by weak credit card data in the category the last few weeks and a poor outlook from furniture e-Commerce giant Wayfair, not to mention a panic-inducing, rambling conference call from the oft colorful CEO of Restoration Hardware. Lazy thematic macro analysis that stops there, however, paints an incomplete picture of what has transpired at many individual companies like WSM that have been deemed COVID beneficiaries that are now at all-time low valuations.WSM is a furniture and home décor retailer that owns several well-known brands: William Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Rejuvenation, Mark &amp; Graham, and most importantly, west elm. While perhaps thought of as a dying mall-based brick &amp; mortar retailer, WSM derives the vast majority (66%+) of its revenue from e-Commerce and has been a remarkably steady performer, remaining free cash flow positive every year since at least 2007 and achieving positive same store sales comps since 2010, including +17% in 2020, +22% in 2021 with guidance for a further mid-to-high single digit growth again this year. Within the overall positive sales trends, west elm’s consistent growth has been even more impressive, with a 16% average annual same-store sales growth rate since 2012. To little fanfare, by our calculation, WSM has become the single highest quality retailer in public markets with a 58% return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2021 and a 39% ROIC on average over the past 3 years…” (Click here to see the full text)14.

The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)10. Waste Management, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CASY)’s is the third largest independent convenience store operator in the U.S. The company has executed well and shares have outperformed a challenging market nicely since the position was initiated a year ago. It may seem strange to sell a position with this backdrop, but I did so for two reasons. First, it was purchased in the first place as a reasonably priced defensive during an orgy of speculation. In this context, CASY served its purpose. Second, given the developments of the past year and Upslope’s overall still-defensive portfolio, I think there are better uses of capital today – specifically cheaper, less-defensive longs. Some of these are highlighted in Exhibit 4 below.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles:Top Investors' Stocks Portfolio: Mid-Cap Stocks12 High Growth Software Stocks that are Profitable12 High Growth Healthcare Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

A perioperative treatment regimen includes treatment before surgery (neoadjuvant) and continued after surgery (adjuvant). The trial will continue to evaluate the other dual primary endpoint of overall survival (OS).At a prespecified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant single-agent KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in EFS compared to neoadjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant placebo. Statistically significant improvements in the trial’s key secondary endpoints of pathological compete response (pCR) and major pathological response (mPR) were also demonstrated at this analysis. No new safety signals were observed.Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted Merck’s new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) based on these data for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with resectable stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (T3-4N2) NSCLC in combination with platinum containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of October 16, 2023.Story continues""Results from KEYNOTE-671 show that KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy provided significant improvement in event-free survival, pathological complete response and major pathological response over chemotherapy alone as a perioperative treatment regimen for patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""By moving this KEYTRUDA-based regimen into earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer, we may be able to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence for these patients. This study is an important milestone, and we look forward to sharing the detailed results with the medical community as soon as possible. We thank the patients and investigators for their important contributions to this study.""Merck has an extensive clinical development program in lung cancer and is advancing multiple registration-enabling studies, with research directed at earlier stages of disease and novel combinations. Key studies in earlier stages of NSCLC include KEYNOTE-671, KEYNOTE-091, KEYNOTE-867, KEYLYNK-012 and KEYVIBE-006.About KEYNOTE-671KEYNOTE-671 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03425643) evaluating neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA as a single agent versus placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant placebo in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB (T3-4N2) NSCLC. The trial’s dual primary endpoints are EFS and OS. Key secondary endpoints include pCR and mPR. The study enrolled 786 patients who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either:KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] every three weeks [Q3W] for up to four cycles) plus chemotherapy (cisplatin [75 mg/m^2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle] and either gemcitabine [1000 mg/m^2, IV; given on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle) or pemetrexed [500 mg/m^2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle]) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery, followed by KEYTRUDA (200 mg IV Q3W for up to 13 cycles) as adjuvant therapy post-surgery, or;Placebo (saline IV Q3W for up to four cycles) plus chemotherapy (cisplatin [75 mg/m^2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle] and either gemcitabine [1000 mg/m^2, IV; given on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle] or pemetrexed [500 mg/m^2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle]) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery, followed by placebo (saline IV Q3W for up to 13 cycles) as adjuvant therapy post-surgery.About lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%, which is a 21% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2021.About Merck’s research in lung cancerMerck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has five approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients.

Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 biggest public companies in the world.While much maligned, and often rightly so, the biggest public companies in the world aren't just intrinsically linked to economic growth and development, but also to the significant improvement in quality of life that mankind has enjoyed in the last few decades. This is why most countries in the world attempt to provide incentives and tax breaks to companies because of the economic improvements and jobs that such corporations provide.So what is the main difference between a public and a private company? A private company is generally owned by founders, management or private investors. On the other hand, a public company has at least a significant portion of its shares held by the general public, also known as free float. This percentage depends on the regulations of a country but is generally at least 25%, which means that the founders may still control the company even if is listed. When a company starts to grow significantly and needs more capital, it offers its shares to the publics in an initial public offering, or IPO, by getting listed on a stock exchange, and you can easily learn more about the biggest IPOs of all time.25 biggest public companies in the worldPhoto by Campaign Creators on UnsplashBecause a public company's shares are owned by the general public, the regulations that it must follow are much more stringent than for private companies, including publishing annual reports, quarterly reports, any material information updates, ESG and much more. The biggest public companies in the world are worth more than the GDP of most nations worldwide, so you can understand the power and influence that these companies possess.While there are some countries without stock exchanges, most have a stock exchange, or even multiple, with more than 40,000 companies listed globally. Of these, only 10% are located in the U.S., but because of its advanced economy and favorable laws and regulations, the vast majority of the biggest public companies in the world are located there. Overall, Asia has the largest number of listed companies which account for close to 37% of the global market value. Because of the recent appreciation in the U.S. dollar, U.S. companies are more dominant than ever in terms of market capitalization. An interesting statistic according to the Organization of Economically Developed Countries in 2019 was that in half of the global listed companies, just three holders held more than 50% of the capital, showing the concentration of both influence and wealth.Story continuesThe biggest public companies in the world have a total market cap of over $22.5 trillion, more than a fifth of the global GDP in 2021, according to the World Bank. These companies dominate the industries they are in and come from a variety of sectors, though tech companies are present thoroughly throughout the list.

That differs from Merck's $40 billion, which was the market capitalization of the company at the time.One potential conflict for the Pfizer deal is Merck's partnership with Seagen on a therapy, Padcev, in combination with Merck's blockbuster Keytruda.SVB Securities analyst Andrew Berens said Pfizer could divest the bladder cancer therapy Padcev, to avoid anti-trust scrutiny. That's because Pfizer also has a partnership with Seagen, splitting the rights to Bavencio, a therapy to manage bladder cancer. This, Berens notes, could be a source of anti-trust concerns.Both Pfizer and Merck are facing patent cliffs — Pfizer with a loss of $17 billion from patent expirations by 2030, including some from the cancer space. Meanwhlie Merck's biggest obstacle is keeping its $20 billion blockbuster Keytruda on patent. Merck is pursuing this by changing the formulation and delivery method.Pfizer company logo is seen at a Pfizer office in Puurs, Belgium, December 2, 2022. REUTERS/Johanna GeronIn June 2022, when the Seagen and Merck deal was first being discussed, investors had mixed opinions. While the cancer portfolio made sense, Seagen's assets would not help solve Merck's Keytruda problem, SVB analysts wrote then.Instead, SVB sees the Seagen deal as a good option for Pfizer, as the biotech could see revenue of nearly $11 billion by 2030 base on its current pipeline.""We think a potential deal is less complex than the Merck deal discussion, and is unlikely to be adversely impacted by the same uncertainties,"" the analysts wrote.If it goes through, the acquisition would be Pfizer's fourth, and largest, in a year, as it continues to leverage it's COVID-19 vaccine and treatment revenue. Pfizer's cash pile of more than $20 billion was boosted by sales to governments and entities globally during the pandemic.Story continuesIn 2022, Pfizer acquired ReViral in June for $525 million, and in October it completed its acquisitions of Biohaven Pharma for $11.6 billion and Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

193,f3321510-956b-345a-9a8b-ad46ef7eee9b,BA,2023-03-01,15 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-airplane-manufacturing-companies-030452916.html,1677639892,STORY,"['BA', 'TXT', 'LMT', 'ERJ', 'GE']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest airplane manufacturing companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the World. When it comes to high technology, the aircraft industry ranks right at the top of the food chain, alongside semiconductor fabrication and astronautics. The modern day jet aircraft - whether civilian or military - has hundreds of thousands of parts which are often shipped from all over the world for final assembly into the beast that takes to the skies.Naturally, this amount of complexity makes for high barriers to entry into the industry and leaves only a handful of firms that are able to make and sell airplanes. Due to their size, jets also take months to assemble and end up costing millions of dollars. This high cost also makes the aircraft manufacturing industry one of the most lucrative in the world - and one which sees little threat from new entrants. For instance, a research report from Polaris Market Research outlines that the aircraft manufacturing market was worth $413 billion in 2021 and that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.7% between then and 2030 to be worth an estimated $626 billion by the end of the forecast period.As is the case with nearly every high tech industry, perhaps except semiconductors, Polaris Market Research also highlights that North America was the largest aircraft manufacturing market in 2021 with a large demand for next generation airplanes fueling the growth. However, despite being the largest, North America will not be the fastest growing sector, as this title will go to Asia Pacific which is fueled by the growing populations of India and China spurring demand and increasing the need for planes to fly people around.The aircraft industry is also evolving, with new manufacturing and computing technologies providing companies the opportunity to improve their operations. One interesting innovation that has made its way to the manufacturing line is the use of smart glasses. These are eyewear that comes equipped with digital displays and provides the assembly technician useful inputs throughout their activities. For instance, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which is one of the world's largest aircraft manufacturers, has found that using these wearables in its wire harness assembly has enabled it to reduce production time by a massive 25%. Boeing is not the only one that uses smart glasses in the aircraft supply chain. One of the world's most advanced jet engine manufacturers, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), has been researching their use since 2017 and found that not only did the mechanics who are responsible for tightening nuts on fuel lines see their productivity improve by 8% due to smart glasses but that 85% of those surveyed said that they reduced errors and 60% preferred using the wearables.Story continuesAnother trend in the industry is the push towards sustainable aviation fuels since air travel is among the leading sources of carbon dioxide emissions. On this front, Boeing announced in February 2023 that it plans to procure 5.6 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel for its 2023 flight operations, more than doubling last year's procurement and accounting for a quarter of the aerospace giant's total fuel needs. Not to be left behind, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is looking at the future as it is designing aircraft that reduce fuel use through their airframe. NASA's Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project aims to invest $425 million with Boeing over seven years as part of the White House's Climate Action Plan.At the same time, demand for conventional aviation is also booming, with Boeing's chief executive officer (CEO) Mr. Matt Welch sharing an update during the firm's fourth quarter of 2022 earnings call held in January 2023. Mr. Welch sounded optimistic about his company's future, sharing that demand was strong across Boeing's portfolio, as he explained that:On the order front and on the market side, we continue to see very strong demand across the portfolio. More than 800 net orders on the year, driven by the 737 MAX and the 787, highlighted most recently by the very historic deal with UAL, United Airlines in December. In 2022, we sold 200-plus net wide bodies. That’s the most since 2018. More broadly, the 737 MAX team has made tremendous progress. Fleet is performing exceptionally well. Production is stabilizing, demand is strong. We delivered 1,000-plus 737 MAXs in total now. And since our return to service, the fleet has surpassed 3 million flight hours. It’s safe and it’s the most reliable of the airplane fleets. Production, we’ve all gone from 0 to 31 a month and we’re prioritizing stability, which we have not yet achieved, but we’re on a steady course to do so.And orders, more than 1,500 gross orders to date. 737 MAX returning to service in China is another indication of this overall improvement in our business. This month, of course, we all know that, that occurred. We have more airplanes on the Tarmac in China to bring back into service just as we did here in the U.S. before we began any deliveries of any sort.The Boeing chief also shared the cheer flowing through his as NASA launched the SLS rocket (built by Boeing) to the Moon last year, and stated:Our SLS launch. This was an enormous emotional upper for our company and for our team broadly. The Artemis 1 launch in November, which was powered by the SLS rocket was more than a little inspiring.Today, we'll look at some of the biggest aircraft manufacturing companies in the world. One of these, unsurprisingly, is Boeing, while the others include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China.15 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the WorldOur Methodology As a starting point for our list, we first listed all publicly traded companies that make planes and selected them through market capitalization.

Why is it so hard to get life-altering genetic testing in the U.S.?,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/takes-average-8-years-rare-173640578.html,1677605800,STORY,['ILMN'],"[Key takeawaysAn estimated 10% of the global population suffers from rare disease; 80% of rare disorders are thought to be genetic.Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can provide diagnoses in about 40% of cases, for several hundred dollars per patient.In the U.S., access to the technology depends factors like the state where patients live, their insurance, and their financial resources.No one wants to find themselves sick or in need of a medical diagnosis. But there are those out there who already are—and are desperately seeking answers.More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash? Consider a checking account bonusThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 homeFor rare disease patients, a diagnosis, even one with a poor outcome, is often a luxury—long sought after, hard won, and, in a worst-case scenario, forever elusive. The average time to diagnosis, if one can be found: eight years.It’s an emotionally and often financially draining time referred to as the “diagnostic odyssey.” While each patient’s journey is unique, they’re fraught with common obstacles: medical trauma, gaslighting, bankruptcy, and missed opportunities for life-changing—and potentially life-saving—treatment.An estimated 80% of rare disorders are due to genetic causes. In the U.K., patients suspected of having a rare disorder are beginning to receive free access to the best science has to offer at the moment—a genetic test that delivers diagnoses in about 40% of cases. Called whole genome sequencing (WGS), it allows scientists to examine all genetic “instructions” found in a cell and look for abnormalities.In the U.S., whether or not a suspected rare disease patient can access such testing depends on myriad factors: which state they live in, which insurances they have, research projects and charity programs at the hospital they’re being seen at, and whether they can afford the hundreds it takes to pay out of pocket for the test.Story continues“Genomes are standard of care in the U.K. for patients with a wide range of rare diseases,” Ryan Taft, vice president of scientific research at biotechnology company Illumina, tells Fortune. “I bring it up frequently, especially if I’m on Capitol Hill. This technology was grown here in the U.S.”It’s a far cry from the state of things in America.Says Taft: “We’re still catching up in catching on that it’s the right thing to do for patients in the U.S.”Rare, yet commonThe U.S. government defines a disease as rare if it affects fewer than 200,000 Americans. Rare diseases include more common rare disorders, like cystic fibrosis, as well as ultra-rare conditions, like fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or “stone man syndrome,” in which muscle and connective tissue are gradually replaced by bone. All but a few types of cancer are rare, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.Individually, rare diseases are rare. But collectively, they’re common. About 10% of the global population is thought to have a rare disorder, even if they’re not aware or haven’t shown symptoms yet, experts say.In the U.S., an estimated 25 to 30 million residents are thought to be affected, with an economic burden of around $1 trillion annually, due to medical costs, forced retirement, absenteeism, and other factors like experimental treatments not covered by insurance. That figure was calculated by the Every Life Foundation for Rare Disorders, which only examined data for 379 rare conditions.There are thought to be upwards of 10,000.From a $100 million price tag to mere hundredsIt’s a nearly unfathomable toll, but one that can be reduced, experts say, by using WGS to shorten, and perhaps even eliminate, diagnostic odysseys and get patients to treatment quickly, when possible.The cost of genetic testing has nosedived over the decades, from around $100 million in 2001 to right around $1,000 today, according to the U.S. National Institute of Health’s National Human Genome Research Institute. This month Illumina began offering $200 genome sequencing, Taft adds.The steep dive in costs has made testing more enticing to insurance providers, especially given the potential savings. WGS for a patient now costs less than a one-day stay in the ICU and can shorten hospital stays, especially for patients in the neonatal ICU, Dr. Wendy Chung, chief of the division of clinical genetics in the department of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, tells Fortune. WGS can further reduce costs for insurance companies by eliminating unnecessary procedures and tests in patients who receive a diagnosis, she adds.Chung heads up the Guardian Study, in partnership with sequencing companies GeneDx and Illumina. The project aims to diagnose 250 genetic conditions not identifiable by typical newborn screenings. All infants are eligible, whether or not they require a NICU stay. The program uses WGS and is provided at no cost to patients.Dr. Stephen Kingsmore, president and CEO of Rady Children’s Institute for Genomic Medicine in California, launched a similar initiative in 2018. Called Project Baby Bear, the groundbreaking project provided rapid WGS to 178 babies in the NICU, providing diagnoses for 43% of them and saving $2.5 million in health care costs. Other states have since developed similar programs, like Project Baby Manatee in Florida and Project Baby Deer in Michigan.Multiple studies have shown an average cost savings of about $15,000 per child who receives WGS, he says. And yet he calls the process of advocating a “state-by-state slough” that involves educating physicians, hospital administrations, and politicians of the benefits of whole genome sequencing—for ill infants, and for the undiagnosed in general.“If we sound a little frustrated, we’ve been doing this for 11 years, and we’re a long way from this being the standard of care” in the U.S., Kingsmore says. Other countries like Australia are ahead of the U.S. in the newborn screening space, he says, adding that Taiwan, Singapore, and Japan are considering implementing such programs.Taft echoes Kingsmore’s sentiment.“I joke sometimes that I’ve spent the last 10 years proving the obvious,” he says. “Genomes are the best thing you can do for patients, if you can.”A ‘tapestry of decision-making’So why isn’t there broader coverage of whole genome sequencing in the U.S., if only for financial reasons?The country is getting there, experts tell Fortune. But because there is no national health system as in the U.K., accomplishing the task is more arduous. It entails getting multiple parties—like state legislatures, insurance companies, and hospital systems—on board to piece together a quilt of coverage to blanket the country, with as few holes as possible.The U.K. “doesn’t have the issue of this tapestry of decision-making,” Kingsmore says. “For us, it’s just a matter of working one state at a time to decide how they’re going to do this in their population.”Even once WGS is available for insurance coverage in a state, there are other barriers, he says: “Physicians might not be aware this exists; hospital administration may not allow it in their hospital.”“It’s going to take time.”Several states provide coverage of WGS to Medicaid patients who need it, like Michigan, Maryland, Oregon, and California. And insurance companies are coming on board. United Healthcare recently began covering WGS, Kingsmore says.Cigna recently updated its policy too, Taft adds. What’s more, the Senate appropriations bill passed in December instructs Medicaid and Medicare to investigate how to integrate such technologies into their coverage.“It’s shifting,” he says. “The U.K. has shifted. The U.S. is moving that way. The world we want to see, where all of these patients can get access to technology like ours—it’s not science fiction. It’s within reach.”‘Genomes for everyone’Taft says WGS must “absolutely” become the standard of care in the NICU. “The evidence is there, we just need to develop the systems to deploy it,” he says. “It’s an implementation problem right now.” Using WGS as a supplemental newborn screening is a goal for down the road, he adds.But he doesn’t want to forget about the “rare disease backlog” of patients—”250 million, at least, worldwide, wandering around with undiagnosed genetic diseases, who haven’t seen a NICU, won’t ever see a NICU, are too old for a NICU,” he says.“We talk about a future of genomes for everyone, and I don’t mean that flippantly,” he says. “I literally think that’s the world we should be aiming for. That’s certainly true for any patient with any indication of a genetic disease.”If the cost savings doesn’t win over decision-makers, Taft, Kingsmore, and Chung hope the humanity of it all might.Kingsmore tells the story of “Baby Fitz,” in whom newborn genetic testing detected an exceedingly rare and usually fatal immune deficiency disease—severe combined immunodeficiency, also known as “bubble boy disease.” Essentially, he had no immune system. The condition was identified before he experienced any symptoms, and he was able to quickly receive gene therapy. He’s yet to experience any symptoms of the disease.“That’s our mission, to end the diagnostic odyssey,” Kingsmore says.And then some: “We want to go beyond the diagnosis and have effective therapies for these conditions.”Taft recalls the case of a boy and his family’s 14-year diagnostic odyssey. The journey came to an end when the boy received genetic testing that showed he had a glucose transport deficiency syndrome, which could be treated with a ketogenic diet.The boy experienced behavioral and cognitive improvements after going on the diet, Taft says. But being diagnosed in the NICU could have been a game-changer. He considers the story a “clarion call.”When the child was born, WGS in the NICU wasn’t possible. “But it is today,” Taft says. “We have the technology, we have the evidence, we can do it.”At this point, it’s a matter of finding the collective will to make it happen.“Are we really saying that we’re withholding information from people that could help them make life and clinical decisions about the care of their child?” he says.“That’s the decision we need to make as a society.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash?

First recognized in 2008 by EURORDIS, a nonprofit alliance for over 1000 patient organizations, Rare Disease Day includes events in more than 110 countries.""Rare Disease Day is an important reminder of the common humanity that underlies these disorders,"" says Ryan Taft, Illumina's vice president of Scientific Research. ""In our lifetimes it is almost certain that we, or someone we know, will be affected by these often-devastating diseases. At Illumina, we have a moral imperative to get these patients the diagnoses they need and deserve.""Each year, Illumina selects four rare disease organizations to support and spotlight their work.Association pour la Recherche Génétique des Anomalies du Développement, better known as ARGAD, is a nonprofit association established in 2010 in Bourgogne, France. The association supports clinical and biological research in the area of genetics of developmental disorders, and assists in education and raising awareness for health care professionals and the public, all with the mission of improving the care and support of rare disease patients in France. To mark Rare Disease Day 2023, ARGAD has been conducting workshops in which children with a rare disease collaborate with professional artists to tell the story of their diagnosis and their experience living with it. This ambitious project will culminate in the creation of a 200-page collectible book of the artwork and an exhibition and discussion panel at the Ground Effect gallery in Paris on February 28.Founded in 1999 by two patient parents, the Taiwan Foundation for Rare Disorders (TFRD) enhances patients' quality of life while also advocating for medical rights. Remarkably, TFRD's efforts prompted the Rare Disease Prevention and Orphan Drug Act-making Taiwan one of the first governments to pass legislation related to rare disease. In addition to promoting research, fostering patient groups, and influencing policy, the organization also provides direct services to 18,000 families, helping with at-home care visits, psychological support, family education, rehab, and more. TFRD has an extraordinary commitment to improving access to diagnostic technologies and it subsidizes genetic testing and newborn screening for low-income families.Story continuesLife changed dramatically for Texan singer-songwriter Casey McPherson and his family when, after pursuing whole-exome sequencing to find an explanation for his daughter Rose's symptoms, she was diagnosed with the rare genetic disease HNRNPH2. To the fans of his music, Casey might seem an unlikely scientist, yet his passion to save his daughter has meant pushing boundaries to model a different future for people living with rare disease and their families: He started the To Cure a Rose Foundation to save his daughter and scale a better model for rare drug development, and he cofounded Everlum Bio, a personalized medicine company and proof-of-concept drug discovery lab to serve family foundations.Finally, the Tanzania Human Genetics Organization (THGO) is a nonprofit organization whose main goal is to coordinate human genetics research and activities in Tanzania to generate knowledge and recommendations for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of genetic disease. THGO envisions a health community that is able to use genetic information and services to save lives and promote healthy outcomes in Tanzania. They work passionately to partner with and support the broader advocacy of disease-specific patient organizations throughout the country (including Ali Kimara Rare Disease Foundation and Lupus Warriors Tanzania) and have formed a coalition-partnership with the Southern Africa Youth Forum to advise and promote the adoption of a common policy on health care and social services for people living with rare diseases in the countries of the Southern Africa Development Community.Illumina also remains committed to supporting the rare genetic disease population through initiatives that provide direct access to clinical whole-genome sequencing. For 10 years, the Illumina iHope program has facilitated pro bono genome testing for more than 1700 children with suspected rare genetic disease across 24 clinical sites in eight countries. Approximately 40% have received a diagnosis and up to 78% received a change in their care management.Based on the success of this program, Illumina recently announced an expansion of iHope to China at the Illumina NGS Summit. In partnership with the Special Fund for Diagnosis and Treatment of Genetic Diseases-under the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation of China-and supported by the Illumina Foundation and Give2Asia, iHope China will provide genetic testing to more than 2000 patients with rare disease over a three-year period. The initiative will also provide training to more than 100 clinicians at 20 Chinese hospitals.Illumina has committed to dramatically expanding access to genome testing outside China through a partnership with Genetic Alliance to develop iHope Genetic Health-a program supported by a $120 million in-kind donation of sequencers, reagents, and software to enable dozens of laboratories to provide genome testing in low- and middle-income communities around the world. This effort will support up to 50,000 patients a year in five years, and will work with local communities to support genetic education, local capacity building, and patient-authorized data use.Learn more about how Illumina is expanding access to genomics, click here.Illumina, Tuesday, February 28, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/741238/Working-To-Solve-Rare-Disease-and-Support-Patients]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Most Promising Cancer Stocks According to Analysts. The market for community oncology services worldwide is projected to experience substantial growth, with an estimated increase from $47.95 billion in 2022 to $53.79 billion in 2023, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 12.2%. This market is predicted to continue expanding and reach $81.33 billion in 2027, with a CAGR of 10.9%. The community oncology services market includes entities that offer diagnostic, curative, and preventive treatment services, and North America is presently the largest region in this market. Western Europe is the second-largest region in the community oncology services market.Novartis and Roche, among other pharmaceutical firms, have collaborated with international cancer organizations to form an alliance with the goal of providing more cancer medicines to underprivileged nations. Presently, low- and middle-income countries have access to less than 50% of the cancer medications listed as essential by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the burden of cancer in these regions is on the rise. Without intervention, nearly 75% of cancer fatalities will take place in these regions over the next ten years.Players in the oncology sector are thriving. In November 2022, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)’s quarterly earnings and revenue exceeded expectations, thanks to strong sales of its significant cancer drugs, prompting the company to raise its full-year earnings forecast and boosting its shares to a 2.5-month high. Despite the prolonged COVID lockdowns, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) managed to expand its business in China and decided not to pursue US authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine. The quarterly revenue surpassed expectations, largely due to better-than-anticipated sales of AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)’s cancer medications such as Tagrisso, Imfinzi, and Enhertu. The broader oncology portfolio also saw a 24% increase in sales. As China accounted for around 16% of AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)’s total revenue last year, the company is viewed as a barometer for the pharmaceutical sector in China.Story continuesOn February 3, 2023, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the use of Trodelvy for a third indication, thereby providing additional treatment options for individuals suffering from the most prevalent form of breast cancer. The medication has been approved for patients with an advanced form of breast cancer, which includes a subtype called HR-positive/HER2-negative, who have ceased responding to hormone-based treatment and at least two prior systemic therapies. Some of the most promising cancer stocks according to analysts include Moderna, Inc.

It offers therapeutic products for hematology, oncology, cardiovascular, immunology, fibrotic, and neuroscience diseases. On February 2, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.82 and a revenue of $11.4 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.09 and $200 million, respectively. On January 17, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Olivia Brayer initiated coverage of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) with an Overweight rating and a $95 price target. The analyst believes that the current situation for the stock is the most favorable since the Celgene deal of 2019. Additionally, the analyst thinks that Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) has one of the strongest growth profiles of all U.S. Pharma companies for the year 2023, particularly given the current economic recession. Brayer also expects the stock to perform well in the first half of 2023 due to the company's maturing new product cycle, which could lead to an increase in the stock's value.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 69 hedge funds were long Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), compared to 68 funds in the prior quarter. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3.86 million shares worth $277.7 million. Like Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), BeiGene, Ltd. (NASDAQ:BGNE), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is one of the most promising cancer stocks to monitor.RGA Investment Advisors made the following comment about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), which we referenced above, boasts a double digit free cash flow yield that gets divided roughly equally between repurchases, a dividend and M&amp;A in what is the best environment for acquisitions perhaps ever. In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”10.

You can skip the industry analysis and go directly to the 10 Largest Energy Companies In the World.The energy sector is a $6 trillion industry that employed around 6.8 million people in the United States in 2022. The energy industry can be divided into two major subgroups, non-renewable or conventional energy, and renewable energy. The non-renewable energy sector includes petroleum and gas products, nuclear, and coal. Renewable energy sources include wind power generation, biofuels, hydroelectric power, and solar power.Conventional Energy MarketIn 2022, conventional energy with the exception of nuclear energy accounted for 85% of the global energy supply. According to a report by McKinsey, the global coal demand reached its peak in 2013 and saw a rise in demand again in 2021. However, it is expected to go in the downward direction from then onwards. Additionally, International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that electricity production from coal in the United States will reduce from 20% in 2022 to 17% in 2024.When it comes to fossil fuels, oil, and natural gas are the most commonly used sources of energy. According to IEA, the global oil demand is expected to rise by 1.9 million barrels a day to a record 101.7 million barrels a day. The most significant demand will be seen by jet fuel at 840,000 barrels of oil per day. McKinsey believes that the global oil demand is expected to peak between 2023 and 2025. However, it will be 35% to 50% lower by 2050 due to the global transition toward renewable energy sources. A significant decline in demand is expected to be caused by the rise in electric vehicles, which according to IEA will account for 60% of new car sales by 2030.According to the IEA, the global gas demand was 87.9 billion cubic feet per day. The McKinsey report states that it will grow by 10%-20% by 2035 and will likely experience a decline afterward.Story continuesCurrently, the global market leaders in the conventional energy market are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Effects of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine on the Conventional Energy MarketThe Russian invasion of Ukraine was one of the most significant events that created uncertainty in the global conventional energy market as a huge part of Europe has been dependent on Russian fuel. The invasion led to the US President Joe Biden issuing an executive order to ban Russian imports and the United Kingdom took the same route. Due to the European Union's dependency on Russian fossil fuels, it did not cut off the imports entirely but decided to reduce them by around two-thirds, mostly due to Germany and Netherlands' reluctance. In 2021, Russia accounted for 13% of the global crude oil supply and 45% of the global natural gas imports, along with 40% of the European Union's demand. On top of that, the country was also responsible for almost 18% of global coal imports.The aforementioned series of decisions led the global supply of fossil fuels to fall and demand to rise significantly. Consequently, crude oil prices went skyrocketing to $110 per barrel in March 2022 from $76 at the beginning of the year. For 2023, S&amp;P Global forecasted that the global oil supply and demand will start to balance out. However, the effects of cutting off Russian oil had more severe repercussions than expected and the global market will take a few years to return to normal levels. The firm expects the growth to be slower in 2023 than in 2022 at 1.7 million barrels per day compared to the prior year's 4.5 million barrels per day. Nevertheless, the prices of fuel commodities are expected to alleviate over the year.Renewable Energy MarketAccording to Allied Market Research, the global renewable energy market was worth $881.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% to almost $2 trillion by 2030. The previously mentioned McKinsey report states that due to the move towards renewable energy and decarbonization, the energy sector is expected to grow by 4% per annum and annual supply and production investments are most likely to reach $1.5 trillion to $1.6 by 2035.Toward the decarbonization of the energy mix, electrification is considered the first step. Electricity generation through wind, solar, and hydrogen power is expected to account for almost 50% of the global power mix by 2035 and then increase to 85% by 2050. Moreover, among the renewable energy sources, green hydrogen is expected to cover 28% of the global power demand by the end of the forecasted period. In the article, we previously mentioned the fall in electricity production from coal. The IEA expects that to be counteracted by renewable energy sources as they rise from 22% in 2022 to 24% in 2024.With the growing demand for renewable energy, even the big players in the conventional energy market are making a shift toward it. Even the oil supermajors have started to invest in renewable energy projects with BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) becoming the first one among them to invest a noteworthy amount.At the moment the companies aiming toward becoming the global renewable energy giants include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB), and Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) along with several others.25 Largest Energy Companies by Market CapPhoto by RawFilm on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we identified the biggest energy companies by market capitalization and listed them in ascending order.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Income-generating stocks are all the rage as the stock market suffered huge losses last year. According to a report by Reuters, Wall Street recorded its biggest annual drop in 2022 since the financial crisis of 2008, as the S&amp;P 500 shed nearly $8 trillion in market cap. Growth stocks also recorded their worst performance in a decade, turning investors’ attention toward overlooked dividend equities.Quality companies that have raised their payouts for a significant period are considered safe during fluctuating market conditions. Historical analysis of these stocks shows that they have outperformed their peers when turbulence in the market occurs. Over the past five decades, dividend growers have surpassed other asset classes when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually, as reported by Sterling Capital. Another reason why dividends make reliable investments is due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. According to a report by Schroders, the average annual return across eight markets was 4.3% in the last 25 years, which increased to an average of 7.1% including reinvested dividends.Analysts often advise investing in companies that have proven track records of dividend growth, as these companies are likely to continue growing their payouts in the long term. In addition to this, such companies are considered less risky as they have stable cash flows and histories of profitability. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some major dividend companies with solid dividend growth streaks and strong balance sheets. In view of this, we will discuss the best consistent dividend stocks to buy in this article.Story continues16 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for at least 10 years.

(NYSE:WSM), worth over $305.3 million collectively.Voss Capital mentioned Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We believe shorting furniture retailers has arguably become a consensus view on the back of widely known tough comps from early 2021 (+26% and +40% SSS Comps for WSM in calendar Q1/Q2 ‘21) and fear of pull forward of demand, which seems to be corroborated by weak credit card data in the category the last few weeks and a poor outlook from furniture e-Commerce giant Wayfair, not to mention a panic-inducing, rambling conference call from the oft colorful CEO of Restoration Hardware. Lazy thematic macro analysis that stops there, however, paints an incomplete picture of what has transpired at many individual companies like WSM that have been deemed COVID beneficiaries that are now at all-time low valuations.WSM is a furniture and home décor retailer that owns several well-known brands: William Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Rejuvenation, Mark &amp; Graham, and most importantly, west elm. While perhaps thought of as a dying mall-based brick &amp; mortar retailer, WSM derives the vast majority (66%+) of its revenue from e-Commerce and has been a remarkably steady performer, remaining free cash flow positive every year since at least 2007 and achieving positive same store sales comps since 2010, including +17% in 2020, +22% in 2021 with guidance for a further mid-to-high single digit growth again this year. Within the overall positive sales trends, west elm’s consistent growth has been even more impressive, with a 16% average annual same-store sales growth rate since 2012. To little fanfare, by our calculation, WSM has become the single highest quality retailer in public markets with a 58% return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2021 and a 39% ROIC on average over the past 3 years…” (Click here to see the full text)14.

This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)10. Waste Management, Inc.

It may seem strange to sell a position with this backdrop, but I did so for two reasons. First, it was purchased in the first place as a reasonably priced defensive during an orgy of speculation. In this context, CASY served its purpose. Second, given the developments of the past year and Upslope’s overall still-defensive portfolio, I think there are better uses of capital today – specifically cheaper, less-defensive longs.

The so-called Dynasty collection is the sole defining holy grail of sneaker collecting. That's according to Sotheby's, who is now auctioning off the Michael Jordan championship game worn sneaker collection in Dubai. Jordan Geller is the ShoeZeum owner. In 2012, the Guinness Book of World Records named him as having the biggest sneaker collection on the planet. Jordan, good to see you, my man. Tell me why this is the holy grail of sneaker collections, and how much do you think it will fetch?JORDAN GELLER: So, yes, thank you so much for having me. This collection is absolutely remarkable. We're talking about a sneaker that Michael Jordan wore during the championship win of each of his six championships, so the shoes that he wore on his feet when they won those championships. And it's just a single shoe from each of those games. I believe that this collection could sell for $100 million.SEANA SMITH: $100 million worth, and that is a heck of a lot of money. Put this in context for us, just in terms of how much maybe other shoe collections have gone for and just how valuable this collection of those six shoes is.JORDAN GELLER: So, very recently, Sotheby's actually auctioned off a jersey that Michael Jordan wore during one game during an NBA Finals run. And actually, the Bulls lost that game when Michael Jordan was wearing that jersey. The jersey sold for over $10 million. So we're talking about a jersey from a losing game going for $10 million compared to six shoes from not only winning games, but from the games that they actually won the championships in. So $100 million, I think, is reasonable.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Insane. Accumulated by a former Bulls communications director. And if you go back, it's remarkable to see the photos of Michael Jordan hopping around or hobbling around with one shoe on after winning a ring. So you know it's legit. If you could weigh in, Jordan, on there is a little bit of something unique about each and every one of these shoes, highlight some of your favorite attributes for us.JORDAN GELLER: Yeah, well, before we get into the individual shoes, I think it's absolutely remarkable that the six shoes were kept together, going all the way back from 1991 when MJ won his first championship in the Air Jordan 6 to when he hit the last shot in 1998. We're talking about an eight-year gap between the first shoe and the last shoe, which shows me that Michael Jordan was collecting shoes before any of us were, or the person that he was giving them to was collecting them. So that's amazing.The Air Jordan 6 was actually inspired by Michael Jordan's Porsche. There's a heel tab that hangs off of the back of the shoe, and it was inspired by the whale tail on the back of Michael Jordan's 911. The Air Jordan 14, which is the last shoe that he wore during the last shot, was inspired by Michael Jordan's Ferrari that he was driving at the time. So the inspirations behind these individual shoes are just amazing. And then the fact that Michael wore them when he won the championships, it makes them real one of one grails.SEANA SMITH: I mean, just from the historical standpoint, when they were worn, the fact that it was worn by Michael Jordan throughout those championship games, and then also just the cultural impact of that going forward, I guess, how do you wrap your head around how significant this is and how much in demand a collection like this will always be?JORDAN GELLER: So let's just talk about the Air Jordan 11, the black and red patent leather shoe that's four from the left. That's one of the most important and iconic Air Jordans of them all. And so just a pair of those that was game worn by Michael Jordan, that's exceptional. But the shoe that he was wearing when they won that championship, when he's laying on the ground in the locker room overwhelmed by emotion because he just lost his father a year earlier, I mean, I can't even imagine what that one single shoe would be worth. And we're talking that that's one of six shoes in this collection. It's astounding.DAVE BRIGGS: And one of my favorite attributes of those shoes, 1993, he writes on this shoe, our last effing game. Clearly, it was nowhere near Michael's last game in '93. What really gave new life to the Michael Jordan collectibles? And will he always be the GOAT when it comes to memorabilia and sneakers like this?JORDAN GELLER: Yes, and something about that shoe with the effing inscription on there, I feel like it really shows Michael Jordan's competitive edge. And while it wasn't the last shoe that he ended up wearing, it was the last shoe that he wore that season to clinch the championship and seal the deal.SEANA SMITH: I am certainly excited to see how much these six MJ worn sneakers end up going for. Jordan Geller, great stuff. Thanks so much.JORDAN GELLER: Thank you.]"

We saw it in the dot-com bust two decades ago, or the Great Recession. Even in COVID, when retail shut down, people were out there running, and our category grew.”New Balance CEO Joe Preston echoed Weber's sentiment, noting that for some people, setting an exercise routine is as simple as lacing up sneakers for a run.“It's a very inexpensive way to begin any sort of fitness regimen, if you will,” Preston told Yahoo Finance Live. “Right now, we're seeing the consumer hold up, particularly the consumers shopping for our brand, and we'll see how that plays out the rest of the year.”French Basque trail runner Benat Marmissolle trains in the mountains near his home in Tardets-Sorholus, southwestern France, on February 9, 2023. (Photo by GAIZKA IROZ/AFP via Getty Images)Running shoes 'so much better' than 5 years agoAccording to Brooks's Weber, there's another factor keeping the running shoe category vibrant: the latest materials that soften impact, weigh less, and may even help athletes to unlock new personal records.That innovation in footwear — particularly in new foam compounds — has offered additional value for customers.“Materials have really revolutionized footwear,” Weber said. “The product today, I believe, is so much better than just five years ago, and materials and putting them together in unique ways is a part of that.”“For example, our Glycerin 20 has a critical foam in it, and we're going to take that technology across our line — it's also in our Catamount shoe and our Hyperion Max,” the Brooks CEO continued. “It's just better. It's lighter weight. It has the best cushion characteristics and durability metrics that we've ever seen in a material.”Story continues'Stranger Things' actor David Harbour laces up a pair of Brooks Glycerin 20 running shoes. (Source: Brooks)New Balance has also capitalized on foam soles in running shoes, and Preston said the athletic footwear company plans to expand the sole to other sports categories as well.“We have a technology called Fresh Foam that we originally developed for our running product,” the New Balance CEO said. “We've been bringing that along into some of our other categories. That for us is a core innovation platform we believe can help athletes in various sports.”Other sneaker companies, including major players such as Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY), have also deployed cash and human capital to research and develop more responsive midsoles — along with some creative names to match.Along with Brooks's “DNA Loft” technology and New Balance's “Fresh Foam,” Nike developed a “ZoomX” foam midsole, Adidas has its “Boost” soles, and HOKA trademarked its cushioning “Profly” and J-Frame foam technology.While a lot of the new designs have centered on foam soles, the “upper” portion of the shoe is next on New Balance's list.“A lot of the innovation, from a footwear standpoint, over the years, has been centered mostly around the midsole, trying to find compounds that are lighter, more responsive, more cushioned, and things like that, and that will continue,” Preston said. “In the future, I see the technology shifting more to the upper, in making things that are more environmentally safe, in trying to reduce waste, and our product teams are really focused on that.”Brad Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Price and EPS SurpriseThe Aaron's Company, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Aaron's Company, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteAaron’s has been gaining from solid customer demand, strategic investments in centralized lease decisioning, robust e-commerce business, strength in the GenNext store program and the BrandsMart buyout. The company has been on track with its efforts to enhance customers' in-store and digital experiences.It has been witnessing strength in its e-commerce platform, driven by enhanced digital payment and servicing platforms. Also, the rising website traffic and a higher conversion rate are likely to have acted as upsides. Some other notable efforts include increased investments in digital marketing, improved shopping experience, same-day and next-day delivery facilities, personalization of products, and a broader assortment, including the latest product categories. Its express delivery program also bodes well.The sturdy performance in GenNext stores is expected to have been a key growth driver. Aaron’s newly acquired appliance and electronics retailer, BrandsMart, is likely to have strengthened its market position and expanded the customer base. The deal is expected to have aided Aaron’s top line in the fourth quarter.Consequently, management, in its last earnings report, raised its 2022 guidance. The company anticipated revenues of $2.23-$2.27 billion, up from the earlier mentioned $2.19-$2.27 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was predicted to be $160-$170 million compared with the prior stated $150-$170 million.

Adjusted EBITDA was forecast to be $190-$195 million compared with the prior mentioned $180-$195 million. Same-store revenues were predicted to decline 7-6%, up from the earlier stated 8-6% decline. In BrandsMart, revenues were anticipated to be $550-$565 million, up from the prior mentioned $545-$565 million. Adjusted EBITDA was expected to be $20-$25 million.However, the company has been witnessing dismal margins and a higher provision for lease merchandise write-offs at the Aaron's Business. Also, lower lease revenues and reduced lease portfolio size, the lower exercise of early purchase options, smaller same-store lease portfolio size and drab retail sales are likely to have acted as deterrents.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Aaron's this season.

Not only did our portfolio companies demonstrate solutions for potential customers and investors-IN2 demonstrated itself, yet again, as a solution for accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.IN2 welcomed nine new companies into its portfolio in 2022, representing building, mobility, and agricultural technologies. The selected companies each received up to $250,000 in funding to test, validate and demonstrate their technologies with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) or the world-renowned Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. They are in good company-as of 2022, our portfolio of 65 now boasts $1.64 billion in follow-on capital since joining the program. That means our portfolio companies raise more than $88 for every $1 invested by IN2.In April, we launched our first all-demonstration cohort which brought together five startups prepared to conduct a real-world installation of their technology with assistance from a community partner. With technical assistance from NREL, IN2 is helping these companies validate their solutions and build credibility to accelerate adoption.For example, Kit Switch is working with Habitat for Humanity LA to deploy its plug-and-play kitchens in Los Angeles, and is doing a separate installation in San Francisco, to turn abandoned buildings into affordable apartment complexes. Community Energy Labs (CEL) is testing its model-predictive building control platform at more than 20 school campuses across the Pacific Northwest. NineDot Energy installed its first vehicle-to-grid charging system in a Brooklyn, New York, parking garage in partnership with Fermata Energy and Revel. In 2023, CorePower Magnetics plans to demonstrate its patented high-performance power electronics with Eaton, and BlocPower hopes to work with Steffes to replace fossil fuel-based appliances in low-income communities.Story continuesIn June, we welcomed four companies focused on improving the resilience of global food systems into our newest agriculture cohort. These companies began collaborative research projects at the Danforth Center, and the now 20 companies in IN2's agriculture cohorts continue work on commercializing solutions to improve the sustainability and resilience of agriculture.Several of our agtech companies completed field trials with our partners at Farmers Business Network during the 2022 growing season to test their products on real farms, providing invaluable learning experiences. Intrinsyx Bio held trials in Indiana and Illinois, collecting usable data for learning how to adjust their product. New West Genetics held a trial in Montana to test two hemp hybrids for yield and quality. EarthSense learned how to adapt their solution to bigger fields and different weather patterns in the Midwest.We were pleased to see the many accomplishments of our alumni companies over the past year, proving that IN2 provides an accelerated path to market. Eleven of our portfolio companies saw successful exits in the form of mergers or acquisitions. IN2 also serves as a breeding ground for companies to form strategic alliances and partnerships.For example, alumni 75F and J2 Innovations announced a collaboration to improve the energy efficiency of mid-sized commercial buildings. 75F and J2 will standardize the use of a tool that allows community members to contribute peer-reviewed, plug-and-play digital twin models of building controls and equipment.These examples only provide a small glimpse into the work that NREL and Wells Fargo do to catalyze cleantech innovation for the built environment and agriculture sector.This year, IN2 also distributed $1 million to seven of our channel partners. Launched in 2017, the Channel Partner Strategic Awards foster an ecosystem of expertise and support within the IN2 Channel Partner network, which consists of more than 60 incubators, accelerators, and universities that mentor and refer companies to the IN2 program. For example, in 2022, BioGenerator helped Plastomics, an IN2 cohort company, spin out a new company called Solis Agrosciences, using IN2 award funding to help set up the new company. Since 2017, IN2 has distributed $6 million through the Channel Partner Strategic Awards.The Channel Partner Strategic Awards also support IN2's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. In 2021, IN2 presented the Channel Partner Strategic Awards, totaling $350,000, to four organizations that provide entrepreneurial opportunities for historically underrepresented individuals in the cleantech industry. The awards supported thousands of BIPOC people and organizations in 2022 including six historically Black colleges and universities, 134 students, 70 farmers, 11 startups, six community partners, and 1,820 businesses.As we enter our ninth year, IN2 aims to multiply the economic and environmental impact of its proven technology incubation model by bringing on new corporate partners that want to find cutting-edge solutions for a more sustainable future. For more information, read the 2022 Annual Report.The Wells Fargo Innovation Incubator (IN2) is a technology incubator for cleantech startups.

""So it just won't go away.""In an interview with the New York Times in April 2021, von der Leyen revealed she had exchanged texts with Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla for a month while the contract was under negotiation, prompting calls to publish the exchange.The Commission said in June 2022 that it no longer had the texts, which later drew criticism from the EU ombudsman.O’Reilly argued many people would understand why von der Leyen approached Bourla to plead Europe’s case for vaccines, as tens of thousands of people on the continent were dying from COVID-19.But secrecy fuels suspicion, she said.“It’s the gift that keeps on giving to people who are hostile to the EU and who are anti-vax, because it can feed into the narrative that something is being hidden.”O'Reilly said the Commission had “stonewalled"" her request last year for it to publish text messages exchanged by von der Leyen and Bourla in the months before Brussels signed a contract in May 2021 with Pfizer and BioNTech to buy up to 1.8 billion doses.A Commission spokesperson told Reuters that it had concluded last June, and informed the ombudsman, that text messages did not quality as an EU document eligible for freedom of information requests under transparency rules.Story continues""In an effort to ensure greater certainty, the Commission is working on issuing guidance on modern communication tools such as text and instant messages,"" a spokesperson told Reuters. It has proposed to other EU institutions that they do the same, the spokesperson added.The findings of the EU-appointed ombudsman are not binding. They can increase scrutiny by other EU institutions and citizens, which happened in this case.Since O'Reilly's declaration, members of the European Parliament vented anger in an October special hearing at Bourla’s refusal to appear and threatened to pursue banning Pfizer employees and lobbyists from entering parliament.In February, the New York Times said it was suing the Commission over failure to release the text messages.

Consider a checking account bonusThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 homeMembers of the panel that advises the Food and Drug Administration voted 7-4 with one abstention to recommend the vaccine as both safe and effective in preventing RSV. Still, several who endorsed the shots also raised concerns about the lack of data on hospitalizations and the highest-risk patients, as well as two incidents of a rare disorder among those who were vaccinated.As it did with its messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccine, Pfizer gained the coveted spot of being first to pass a key barrier to the US market for a lung illness that affects thousand of people each year. Pfizer has been vying with the UK’s GSK Plc over what is estimated to become a $10 billion RSV market. GSK will face its own advisory committee hearing on Wednesday for what infectious disease specialists call the last big respiratory virus without a vaccine.Pfizer shares rose 0.8% in pre-market trading.People with weak immune systems are particularly at risk for RSV along with older people, with 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths recorded among US elderly each year from the disease, according to one 2005 study.Both Pfizer and GSK have produced strong data showing the vaccines are effective in adults 60 and older, although there’s relatively little evidence on how much the vaccines reduce hospitalizations from RSV.Several committee members raised safety questions because of two cases of a rare potential side effect among close to 20,000 trial participants who received the vaccine, which the FDA called an important potential risk before the hearing. The rare disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome, occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the nerves, sometimes causing paralysis that is usually temporary. The syndrome has been associated with vaccination in rare cases.Story continues“One case is a red flag, two cases is very concerning, and it’s concerning to me that Pfizer doesn’t think that there are any safety concerns,” said panel member Marie Griffin, a Vanderbilt University health policy and medicine professor.Confounding factorsPfizer responded that there were confounding factors such as prior medical events that occurred in the same two patients and that the older population has higher incidences of the syndrome. The company said it would conduct a study after the drug reaches the market and is in touch with the FDA on designing it.Other committee members said data supporting the vaccine were scant. Hana El Sahly, a Baylor College of Medicine virologist who serves as committee chair, questioned why Pfizer didn’t wait until it had data for a second RSV season before applying for regulatory approval. Pfizer officials responded that data is coming shortly. Some members even requested that the vote be delayed until more data became available.The RSV vaccine market for adults will be worth up to $10 billion by 2032, according to projections by Bloomberg Intelligence. Pfizer is also facing off with collaborators Sanofi and AstraZeneca Plc to develop prevention for dangerous RSV infections in newborns, a market that could reach $1.5 billion.Once the FDA decides whether to go along with the advisory committee’s vote, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will issue recommendations that could have a big impact on how often the RSV vaccines are used—and how much revenue the two companies ultimately generate from them.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash?

One member abstained during voting.GSK, which is another forerunner in a crowded race to develop the first RSV vaccine, will face scrutiny from a panel of experts to the FDA on Wednesday.Companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna Inc and Merck are also looming on the horizon.While panelists backed Pfizer's vaccine, concerns were voiced over insufficient efficacy data in the company's study for adults 80 and above, who need the vaccine the most, and suggested a need for detailed post-marketing safety surveillance to address issue of any serious adverse event.""The population where the vaccine is going to potentially have the biggest impact is less represented in this study,"" said Hana Sahly, one of the 12 FDA panelists.The first approved vaccines for the virus, which kills roughly 14,000 older adults in the United States annually, could help the firms gain a foothold in a market estimated at $5 billion to $10 billion, according to analysts.The FDA is scheduled to decide on the vaccines by May, and typically follows the recommendations of its independent panel of experts.Pfizer's vaccine was 66.7% effective in preventing RSV-related lower respiratory tract illness with over two symptoms, while GSK's vaccine was 82.6% effective in preventing lower respiratory tract disease in people aged 60 and over.(Reporting by Manas Mishra, Khushi Mandowara, Mariam E Sunny in Bengaluru and Michael Erman in New York; Editing by Caroline Humer, Sriraj Kalluvila and Maju Samuel)]"

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted that available data is adequate to support the safety and effectiveness of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bivalent vaccine candidate PF-06928316 or RSVpreF. The Committee voted 7 to 4 on safety and 7 to 4 on effectiveness. The vaccine candidate is currently under FDA review for the prevention of acute respiratory disease and lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in adults 60 years of age and older.""In older adults, RSV can result in serious illness, hospitalization, or even death, so there is a significant need to protect this at-risk population,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. ""We are encouraged by the outcome of today’s VRBPAC meeting as it is a testament to the strength of our science and dedication to bringing this important vaccine candidate to the market. We look forward to working with the FDA as it completes the review of our application.""The VRBPAC based its recommendation on the scientific evidence shared by Pfizer, including interim data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT05035212) RENOIR (RSV vaccine Efficacy study iN Older adults Immunized against RSV disease) announced with top-line results in August 2022 and presented at IDWeek 2022. Pfizer intends to publish these results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.The role of the VRBPAC is to provide recommendations to the FDA; however, these recommendations are not binding. The FDA’s decision on whether or not to approve RSVpreF for the prevention of acute respiratory disease and lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age and older is expected by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date in May 2023.Story continuesBurden of RSVRSV is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness.1 The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual and can potentially cause severe illness in young infants, older adults, and individuals with certain chronic medical conditions.2,3,4 In the United States alone, among older adults, RSV infections account for approximately 60,000-160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000-13,000 deaths each year.5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 Among children younger than five years old in the U.S., RSV infections account for approximately 2.1 million outpatient visits and 58,000-80,000 hospitalizations occur each year.8,14,15RSV is a disease for which there are currently no targeted prophylactic, therapeutic, or vaccine options for older adults and the medical community is limited to offering only supportive care for adults with the illness.About RSVpreFPfizer is currently the only company pursuing regulatory applications for an RSV investigational vaccine candidate for both an indication to help protect older adults, as well as a maternal indication to help protect infants through maternal immunization. Regarding the maternal indication, earlier this month Pfizer announced that the FDA had granted priority review to a biologics license application for RSVpreF for the prevention of lower respiratory tract and severe lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals. A Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date in August 2023 was set.Pfizer’s investigational RSV vaccine candidate builds on foundational basic science discoveries including those made at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which detailed the crystal structure of prefusion F, a key form of the viral fusion protein (F) that RSV uses to enter human cells. The NIH research showed that antibodies specific to the prefusion form were highly effective at blocking virus infection, suggesting a prefusion F-based vaccine may confer optimal protection against RSV. After this important discovery, Pfizer tested numerous versions of a stabilized prefusion F protein and identified a candidate that elicited a strong anti-viral immune response in pre-clinical evaluations. The bivalent vaccine candidate is composed of equal amounts of recombinant RSV prefusion F from subgroups A and B.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

221,c775c458-e27d-3219-b524-a388505756d0,PYPL,2023-03-01,15 Biggest Payment Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-payment-companies-world-212654149.html,1677619614,STORY,"['PYPL', 'GPN', 'EVOP', 'WU', 'BILL', 'EEFT', 'V', 'AXP']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest payment companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Payment Companies in the World. The advent of the Internet has revolutionized business and created new technologies for people to conduct their daily lives. One such area is business, where firms now have access to a global workforce that lets them offshore their tasks to employees in other countries to save up on costs. At the same time, firms can collect their payments digitally as well, which reduces the need of keeping cash at hand for both them and the consumer.At the heart of this facilitation is the payments processing industry. This industry started up along with the internet, as PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) became one of the first firms that disrupted the traditional banking model and enabled users to make and accept payments over the Internet. Since then, both traditional players and new entrants have entered into the market. As a result, the global payments industry was worth a whopping $92 billion in 2021 according to research from Precedence Research. From this, it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.49% until 2030, by the end of which the firm believes it will have an estimated market value of $572 billion.Within the market, there are a couple of trends that are contributing to its growth. These include the widespread adoption of smartphones, which provide users with a convenient way to manage their finances by easily accessing the Internet and using software applications. Additionally, and particularly as the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated, the demand for online shopping is immense, due to the convenience offered in both browsing through items and receiving them without having to leave the comfort of one's home. Zooming in on different industry segments, the one dealing with plastic currency or debit cards forms the largest segment, and companies are also increasingly starting to rely on the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to weed out fraudulent activities on their platform. Artificial intelligence, as futuristic as it sounds, is simply an advanced form of linear regression that reaches conclusions about a set of data points by either using pre-fed parameters or evaluating new data sets. Within fraud detection, this generally involves taking a database of previously fraudulent transactions, and using their specific parameters, such as frequency, amount, and location, to train the algorithm for future events.Story continuesAccounting and financial firm Deloitte takes a deeper look within the industry to further closely analyze what lies in the future for this disruptive and critical sector. It explains that instantaneous - or real time - payment processing will continue to expand in the U.S. as it will expand its coverage to also include business to business and business to consumer use cases. These involve areas such as payroll processing and more. Deloitte adds that the growth of gig economies is also fueling digital payments since workers in several areas do not have access to the traditional financial system such as banking accounts. Deloitte adds that a crucial market area that is gaining traction these days is one where companies act as an intermediary between a bank that has issued a plastic currency card and the merchant that is accepting payments from the card.As the industry starts to mature and more firms enter, existing players are looking at means to improve their customer relationships to retain market share. This was also on PayPal's chief executive officer (CEO) Mr. Daniel Schulman's mind as he explained the steps that his firm is taking to improve the customer shopping experience and improve the ease with which they can carry out transactions with each other. Mr. Schulman's comments came during his company's earnings call for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 as he outlined:We are putting significant resources behind the modernization of our checkout experience in order to defend and grow our market share in our branded checkout business. This includes a drive towards passwordless, one click native in-app experiences as well as deploying the next generation of advanced checkout using our data and AI capabilities. Although this will be a multiyear initiative and will take time given the scale of our base and our legacy integrations, I am extremely pleased with the progress we made last year. We will continue to deliver scaled growth for Braintree. And last year, we made significant progress in modernizing our architecture and capabilities. These improvements resulted in a substantial number of new sales and incremental volume from existing accounts.In addition, we have an impressive pipeline of opportunity for 2023. In the first half of this year, we intend to fully ramp our unbranded offering to small and midsized businesses, either directly or through channel partners. The launch of PPCP, or PayPal Complete Payments, will meaningfully expand our unbranded total addressable market by as much as $750 billion, and enables us to drive incremental share with higher margins than our Braintree Enterprise service. On the consumer side, we’ll continue to enhance our digital wallet value proposition. We are focused on the end-to-end customer experience, from onboarding to the entirety of the consumer life cycle, utilizing more advanced forms of AI to drive optimal consumer choices. In the past two years, we have introduced a significant number of products and services.Today, we'll look at some of the largest payment companies in the world, with the top picks being Visa Inc.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.07 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.87 points to a change of +17.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.72 indicates a change of +17.5% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.23 billion and $31.98 billion estimates indicate +6.2% and +9.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.24%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(PRNewsfoto/IBM)The study* of 2,500 organizations in 12 countries and 10 industries found a small increase in the number of women at the C-suite and Board level (now 12% for both), and an increase to 40% representation of women in junior professional/specialist roles (37% in 2021). However, the pipeline for top leadership positions still hasn't recovered to pre-pandemic levels – 14% representation of women in senior vice president roles (18% in 2019) and 16% in vice president roles (19% in 2019).In addition, fewer than half (45%) of organizations surveyed report they have made advancing more women into leadership roles a top, formal business priority.""While we're pleased to see slight progress in the representation of women at the C-suite and Board levels, it's imperative that companies do more to fill the pipeline that leads to these powerful positions,"" said Lindsay Kaplan, Co-Founder and Chief Brand Officer of Chief.  ""Women are significantly underrepresented at nearly every level of the workforce. If companies prioritize gender diversity across their entire organizations through policies, investments, and a culture that meaningfully supports women, we'll see a transformative impact — equity for everyone in the workplace and stronger, more resilient businesses.""""Enabling equity and inclusion gives organizations a competitive edge, yet many companies do not act as if their success depends on it,"" said Kelly Chambliss, Senior Vice President and COO, IBM Consulting. ""To thrive in a rapidly changing world, organizations must prioritize advancing women – and all historically under-represented groups – and take action to challenge structural barriers and unconscious bias.""Story continuesThe study also found:Optimism is rising, but it doesn't reflect reality. Respondents estimate their industry will see gender parity in leadership in 10 years, compared to 2019 when the average industry estimate was 54 years. But the reality is, at the current rate of change based on survey data, gender parity is still decades away.Structural barriers and unconscious bias continue to hinder women's advancement. Since the height of the pandemic, more organizations have implemented career development planning for women, diversity training, and the creation of women's networking groups. However, biases persist – for example, when asked if women with dependent children are as dedicated to their jobs as women without children, the majority of respondents say yes, this is what leaders in their organization believe, except for male managers—only about 40% agreed.The attributes perceived as critical for leadership also remain gendered. Respondents shared men are primarily valued for creativity and being results-oriented with integrity, and expected women to be strategic and bold but also people-oriented.The pandemic continues to have a disproportionate impact on women at work. Respondents rank the pandemic as the most serious disruption facing women, in recognition of the immense, lasting toll it has taken on them.""The research data shows the hollowing out in the middle is real,"" said Salima Lin, Sr. Partner and Vice President of Strategy, Transformation and Thought Leadership, IBM Consulting. ""Structural changes, including reimagining leadership tracks and role descriptions, improving pay transparency, and setting representation goals, can open new pathways for women to progress to more senior roles.""The study also presents a roadmap for sustainable progress based on leadership practices gathered from the research findings, including:Reframe women's leadership advancement in the language of business results, such as quantifying the concrete economic gains that can accrue from righting gender imbalances.Give your strategy teeth, such as putting specific directives and measures behind your organization's action plan, like setting measurable goals for women's advancement.Enact an action plan aimed at driving gender equity across the full leadership pipeline, like going beyond awareness training to using experiential learning techniques like role playing and reverse mentoring to help shift biases.Re-design roles at the top that work for top talent, for example, limiting hiring criteria to a core set of gender-neutral requirements.To view the full study, visit: https://ibm.co/women-leadership-2023*Study Methodology  The global study, conducted by the IBM Institute for Business Value and Chief in cooperation with Oxford Economics, surveyed 2,500 executives, managers, and professionals—an equal number of women and men—from organizations in 12 countries and 10 industries.

The shift will also provide an opportunity for more commercial focus and support to Molson Coors’ non-alcohol and spirits portfolios, which are ready to scale after several years of successful growth.""In 2022 we achieved top- and bottom-line growth for the first time in a long time, and our goal is to do so consistently year after year,"" said Gavin Hattersley, President and CEO of Molson Coors. ""We’re building on what we accomplished over the past three years, unlocking the next phase of growth for our business through greater collaboration, faster decision making, and stronger commercial support for our total portfolio.""The full range of commercial operations in the U.S., Canada and Latin America, including sales, marketing, innovation, and digital strategy, as well as the company’s non-alcohol and liquor portfolios, will be included in the new function’s remit. As the company continues its transformation to a total beverage business, moving to a centralized commercial team helps ensure the beyond beer portfolio can fully benefit from the resources of the larger commercial structure. A new digital team will be charged with building a unified digital ecosystem across the Americas to support speed, consistency, and quality of output. The innovation team will now report directly into the larger commercial function to better align across the Americas and drive speed of innovation in beer, flavored beverages, non-alcohol products, liquor and more.Story continuesMichelle St. Jacques, who has served as Molson Coors’ Chief Marketing Officer since 2019, has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer. Her leadership has been integral to the company’s success in strengthening iconic core brands like Coors Light through the launch of ""Made to Chill"" and building a strong premium light portfolio strategy with clear right to win paths for both Miller Lite and Coors Light. St. Jacques has also accelerated Molson Coors’ above premium portfolio, building into new white spaces with successful innovations like Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Simply Spiked Lemonade. Canadian-born, St. Jacques’ international commercial experience will be an asset in the new role.""Since joining our company, Michelle has built a track record of building brands and attacking white spaces with a consumer-first mindset to effectively drive our business forward,"" said Hattersley. ""While many know of her creativity and bold swings in marketing, I have seen firsthand how she uses her growth and commercial mindset to collaborate across marketing, sales and the regions to maximize impact. In doing so, she not only demonstrated a deep understanding of the total business, she also earned the confidence of distributors and retailers alike. I am very happy that she will be taking on this new role as she helps drive our Americas business to new heights.""""We have always been at our best when we work together and collaborate as one commercial team. Over the past few years, we’ve built an amazing partnership across sales and marketing, collaborated to drive a unified approach to building our global brands across the U.S., Canada and Latin America, and built our new go-to-market strategies across non-alc and hard liquor,"" said St. Jacques. ""With this new structure, I see a huge opportunity to go even further, scaling our brands, innovation and digital capabilities faster across the region and accelerating our ambitions as a beverage company.""St. Jacques has selected Sofia Colucci as the company’s new Chief Marketing Officer. Colucci, who has earned a reputation for creative excellence, joined the organization in 2017 and currently serves as the global vice president of marketing for Miller Brands and economy. Under her leadership, Miller Lite is now the healthiest it has been in years, growing total category share in the U.S. Colucci excels in her ability to balance creativity with brand building to drive growth, evident in the launch of the Tastes Like Miller Time global creative platform, culturally relevant brand acts, and the recent success of Molson Coors’ first Super Bowl ad in over 30 years.After successfully bringing Molson Coors into new categories and bringing brands like ZOA Energy and Five Trail whiskey to a point where they are ready to scale, current president of emerging growth, Pete Marino, will be leaving the business as he pursues his next entrepreneurial venture.""Pete and his team turned a series of firsts for our business into emerging spaces in our portfolio, and now into scale plays in our industry. We would not be in a position to scale our emerging growth business if it were not for their work,"" said Hattersley. ""Personally, I’ve known Pete since pretty much the day I moved to the United States. He’s incredibly bright with a big heart and quick wit, and I look forward to following his future success.""""Creating a new chief commercial officer role will take our great start in emerging growth to the next level, and I fully support the move. Making the transition into a beverage company is the right path for Molson Coors, and the new structure should help provide additional commercial support that will set up our non-alc and spirits teams for even faster growth as they move to scale,"" said Marino. ""I am so proud of the partnerships we have developed and the brands we have built. This is the right time to rethink our structure to accelerate the growth of these emerging brands by bringing them more fully into the broader business. I’ve always favored entrepreneurial opportunities, whether it was starting my own business a few years ago or bringing the emerging business to life at Molson Coors, and this is a good time for me to step out of the company and focus on my next entrepreneurial venture.""The change comes after Molson Coors posted strong results in 2022, achieving top- and bottom-line growth for the first time in over a decade. The company’s portfolio of brands also turned in impressive results. For the first time in at least 15 years, in the fourth quarter of 2022, Coors Light and Miller Lite’s combined U.S. volume share exceeded Bud Light in tracked channels. In Canada, Molson Canadian grew revenue and industry share for the full year. The U.S. above premium portfolio gained the second-most dollar share of all major U.S. brewers in 2022.

To skip our detailed analysis of the next generation battery market, you can go directly to see the 5 Next Generation Battery Technology Companies. As the demand for reliable and sustainable energy sources continues to grow, there is an increasing focus on producing more efficient batteries. Next generation battery technology companies are at the forefront of developing advanced batteries that are more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. These companies are working on a wide range of technologies, including lithium-ion, solid-state, and flow batteries, among others.A huge part of next generation battery technologies is the market share of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). According to Reuters, the auto industry has invested $1.2 trillion globally in the development of EVs as of January 2023. Some notable players in this industry include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). A report by the International Energy Agency estimates that the battery usually accounts for 30% to 40% of an EV's total value. Furthermore, according to McKinsey's global market outlook report for 2030, the demand for Li-on batteries is expected to see 33 percent annual growth to reach a value greater than $400 billion by 2030 with a market size of 4.7 TWh. The mobility sector is supposed to account for more than 80% of the total market including 4,300 GWh of the total market size. China accounted for more than half of the growth of the EV market in 2021 and is estimated to account for 40% of the total Li-on demand in 2030. However, the EU and the United States are expected to show the highest growth due to recent regulatory changes and this implies that the number of battery factories will also increase by around 150 by 2030.Several companies are leading the charge in the development of next-generation battery technology. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), for instance, has been a pioneer in the development of advanced lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage systems. The EV market is supposed to see the next generation of vehicles to hit the market around 2025 with new technologies such as the silicon carbide IPG5 inverter which can help extend an EV's range by over 7%. A large driver of this market is also sustainability, as battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have 77% lower emissions in Europe and 88% lower emissions in the United States as compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. With a larger focus on the reduction of carbon footprints, BEVs could play an instrumental role in mobility.Story continuesIn addition to established players, many startups are also emerging in the next-generation battery market. These startups are developing innovative battery technologies, such as solid-state batteries, which have the potential to provide higher energy density, faster charging times, and improved safety. Some of the notable startups in this space include QuantumScape Corp (NYSE:QS), Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP), and FREYR Battery (NYSE:FREY).In October 2022, the Bidden-Harris Administration awarded a $2.8 billion grant to twenty companies, some of which are battery startup companies, in order to boost the production of EVs in the country through the U.S. Department of Energy. The reason for this is that China dominated the supply market of materials used to produce batteries including lithium, graphite, and battery-grade nickel. The country aims to invest more than $9 billion to reach its goal of EVs making up half of all new vehicles sold by 2030.Overall, the next-generation battery technology market is rapidly evolving but, with significant potential for growth and innovation. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize the way we store and use energy, leading to a more sustainable and efficient future.10 Next Generation Battery Technology CompaniesPhoto by Kumpan Electric on UnsplashLet's now take a look at 21 next generation battery technology companies.Our MethodologyThe process for selecting the top 21 next-generation battery technology companies involved a comprehensive analysis of various factors, including market share, financial performance, and innovation.

(NASDAQ:UAL) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at United Airlines Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings What's The Opportunity In United Airlines Holdings?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that United Airlines Holdings’s ratio of 22.5x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 20.41x, which means if you buy United Airlines Holdings today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe United Airlines Holdings should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since United Airlines Holdings’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from United Airlines Holdings?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for United Airlines Holdings. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? UAL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at UAL? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UAL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for UAL, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about United Airlines Holdings as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Target How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Target is:25% = US$2.8b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.25.Does Target Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Target has a similar ROE to the average in the Multiline Retail industry classification (22%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Target.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesTarget's Debt And Its 25% ROETarget does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.44. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Showing some growth over the holiday season but warning it could see a slowdown. CEO Brian Cornell saying that it continues to be a very challenging environment, and Target's CFO joined Yahoo Finance earlier today and shared a similar sentiment.- And we see a consumer that's leaning in to some of those seasonal moments. We are pleased with results in Valentine's Day, but we're mindful of the trends that we saw emerge in the fourth quarter, and we think it's appropriate to plan cautiously in that environment. You know, there's some uncertainty as we look out and see what 2023 might hold, and we want to make sure that we're planning prudently against that backdrop.DAVE BRIGGS: He went on to say Target is focusing on getting that inventory story under control, which they are showing the numbers in favor of that somewhat, but it's going to be a challenge given how we're seeing Walmart continue to chip away at their business-- in particular, some of those high-income shoppers, which has been a real surprise in the latest quarterly results, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Dave, it certainly has been. And when you take a look at those quarterly results, stock up Target. Compare that to what we saw from Walmart and the difference that we're seeing in stores of-- in terms of comp sales. Q4 comp sales for Target you're looking at on your screen. Up just about 7/10 of a percent compared to a more than 8% jump that we saw at Walmart. So you certainly are seeing more and more consumers trading down maybe to Walmart.So Target has to do something at this point. They are taking some steps to launch some of their-- more of their own brands. They're launching more than 10 own brands. Among them-- or expanding those-- Cat &amp; Jack, which is the kids line, something I use all the time. Certainly on the lower end of the price range, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. That has certainly worked for its consumers in the past.Story continuesAnd, Dave, they're also going to be adding more items, offering more items in the $3 to $10 to $15 range, which maybe that will do the trick and help them get some consumers-- more consumers through their doors.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, the private-label brand Target and Walmart have in common. You're seeing everyone really go to that move. Amazon's doing it. Kroger is doing it. Costco is doing it. Everyone launching their own private label brands, in particular because they were up 11% overall in 2022. And for Target, they far exceeded that, up 18% in terms of their private-label brands. So that is clearly an advantage they seek to take more advantage of.Consumers' spending habits have indeed changed, and that's what Brian Cornell talked a lot about. Discretionary spending down 13%. So you're really seeing people pull back when it comes to home and apparel. They continue to spend on food and beverage. And the one right in the middle, Seana, that almost seems like we have to ask ourselves if it is a discretionary item is cosmetics, makeup. People do continue to spend on those, which almost feels like a staple at this point based on what we've seen from some other retailers.SEANA SMITH: I would consider it a staple. I think it's a necessity for everyday life, but hey, that's just me. So I think it makes a lot of sense that people continue to buy those products.Also Target relying a little bit more heavily on its loyalty program, making some improvements there. Saying that they're going to try and make it, quote, ""more compelling promotions and improvements there to try and help get that return customer,"" which we know is so critical, especially in times of uncertainty like this.]"

Many, including high-income households, are buying more store-label brands as budgets stretch in the face of higher interest rates.Minneapolis-based Target, which has nearly 2,000 stores, reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street’s expectations for the first time in a year, as it shifted its focus to selling more food and lower-priced items under its higher-margin private-label brands including Favorite Day, Good &amp; Gather and Mondo Llama.Target generates more than $30 billion in sales from its 48-owned brands, the company disclosed in a presentation on Tuesday adding that these brands grew faster than overall sales in 2022.Now it plans to double down on its in-house products.Target said it plans to launch or expand more than 10 owned brands, adding thousands of new products. The majority of these items will be sold for $3, $5, $10 and $15, according to the retailer.The move comes after Target saw higher sales of $3 ornaments, $5 candles and $10 throw pillows, Christina Hennington, the company's chief growth officer, said on a call on Tuesday.It also follows discount chain Five Below Inc's plans to open more than 200 new stores in 2023 and convert 400 existing stores to its ""Five Beyond"" format, which sells items priced above its $5 threshold.CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said Target's motive to lower prices was to drive more traffic to its stores.Story continues""It is nice to see Target invest in own brands and use that as a way to keep differentiating themselves against Walmart and Kroger,"" he said.Consumer prices rose at a more rapid monthly pace in January, the Labor Department reported earlier this month. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.5% in January, as prices for food, fuel and apparel accelerated at a more rapid rate. In the 12 months through January, inflation was 6.4%, compared to 6.5% in December.Walmart executives said last week that they have seen stretched consumers gravitate towards private label, such as its Great Value and Equate brands.Target's private-label brands are generally more expensive than at Walmart, a Reuters review of their online prices showed. In one example, a 64-ounce Great Value bottle of orange juice sells for $2.98 on Walmart.com compared with $3.69 for Good &amp; Gather orange juice in the same size.Dollar Tree, which dropped its long-standing $1 policy in November 2021, said last year its focus to offer more $3 to $5 items was working for its products that competed against those in grocery and drugstores, and led to its first traffic increase in three years during its third-quarter ended October 29 last year.The Virginia-based chain said it was planning on adding more $3 and $5 items to its fleet of 16,000 stores in the years ahead.

If you want to skip the investment philosophy of Ken Fisher and the detailed analysis of Fisher Asset Management, go directly to Ken Fisher's 5 New Purchases/Additions.Ken Fisher, the founder, executive chairman and co-chief investment officer of Fisher Asset Management, predicts that the market conditions in 2023 will resemble those of 1967, as outlined in an article posted in the New York Post. In 1966, inflation was high, there were concerns about a possible recession, and the US Federal Reserve was increasing benchmark interest rates to counter inflation. The S&amp;P 500 Index experienced a 22% decline that year, similar to the 2022 market conditions. However, the market recovered in the fourth quarter of 1966, with a 6% gain, and recorded a YoY rise of 24% in 1967. The current market has also staged a comeback, with a 7.2% gain since October 2022.In one of the interviews, Ken Fisher suggested that investors can position their portfolio to benefit from a new bull market bounce by investing in categories that have dropped the most during the bear market. He said that we are currently in the early stages of a new bull market that began in October 2022 and expects sectors that were hurt the most last year, such as information technology and other growth-oriented sectors, to perform well in the first part of this new bull market. Ken Fisher also noted that sectors and categories that did well during the recent bear market, such as energy, tend to underperform during the initial bull market bounce, which may seem counterintuitive to some investors. Ken Fisher's 15 New Purchases/AdditionsRegardless of whether a new bull market is already underway or not, Ken advised investors to expect the market to bounce in the near future and suggests investing in categories that suffered the most during the downturn as a way to benefit during a market recovery.Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management 13F portfolio value also increased from $133.41 billion in Q3 to $147.93 billion in Q4 2022. The fund made 145 new purchases in the fourth quarter, additional purchases in 440 stocks, sold out 168 equities, and reduced holdings in 389 stocks. Some of the popular companies in which Ken Fisher made additional/new purchases in his Q4 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we focused on the top 100 positions and identified the biggest additions/purchases in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Although sales were slightly better than expected, Target saw a slowdown in discretionary sales. Gross margins were below expectations with higher markdowns, increased shrink, and incremental costs. Long-term, we expect Target to be able to return to operating margins in the 6% to 8% range as inventories return to normal levels as well as seeing a normalization in supply chain costs.”13. Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 8%Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) produces and distributes industrial items and equipment worldwide.

Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 8%Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) provides a variety of business and retail banking, credit card, and other financial services. With over 100 million clients, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is a major participant in the credit card industry. In the past, the corporation has targeted customers with less-than-ideal credit ratings with its offers. What is shockingly obscure, though, is that Capital One is one of the largest full-fledged banks in the country, in addition to being the principal lender behind its cards. It presently holds assets worth close to $400 billion and loans totaling more than $300 billion.Securities filings for the third quarter of 2015 reveal that Ken Fisher added Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) to his portfolio by acquiring 7,189 shares worth $521,000. In the fourth quarter of 2022, he increased his stake in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by 8%, and his 0.58% stake in the company is now worth about $870.33 million.Based on 6 buy ratings, 6 hold ratings, and 3 sell recommendations, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has a consensus rating of ‘Hold.’ Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)’s largest investor is Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates, which owns 12.60 million shares of the company.Here is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Additionally, we initiated a position in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) during the quarter. Capital One is one of the largest issuers of Visa and Mastercard credit cards in the U.S. The company also has a banking network, offers auto and home loans, and manages assets for institutional and high-net-worth clients. We like that Capital One possesses a strong capital position and a common equity tier-1 ratio that exceeds both regulators’ requirements as well as the company’s own internal target. We appreciate the company’s good underwriting track record and its history of lower than expected loss rates given its business mix and yield. In our view, Capital One’s management team is focused on the long term as evidenced by its consistent reinvestment in technology development, and its online/branch bank provides a stable deposit base with decent funding cost. At roughly 5x 2022 consensus earnings and 1.1x tangible book value per share, the stock trades at a significant discount to the market and our estimate of intrinsic value.”]11. Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) creates, produces, commissions, and retrofits building systems and products internationally and in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

Once a multi-industrial corporation, the company successfully turned itself into a pure-play buildings solutions and technology provider. Catalysts we previously identified for Johnson Controls included synergies following its merger with Tyco International, which provides fire safety and building security products, as well as benefits from its separation of non-building-focused businesses, such as automotive seating and batteries. With all catalysts in sight now nearing completion, and Johnson Controls now a better business for it – with higher recurring revenues and lower capital intensity – we decided to exit our investment to help fund the purchases of Xcel Energy and Atmos Energy.”10. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) offers cloud-based solutions for defining, structuring, administering, and automating enterprise services throughout North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, and other regions. SCGE Management, with 935,100 shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management bought  108,079 more shares of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in Q4. This amount represents a 9% increase over Fisher holdings in ServiceNow relative to the prior three-month period. According to the diversified holding company's 13F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Fisher Asset Management initially took a stake in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in the second quarter of 2014.In the last quarter, the company had 1,637 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract revenue. In addition, ServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”9. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a bank and financial holding corporation that provides banking and nonbank financial services.

The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 10%Salesforce, Inc.

According to the analyst, finding interesting stories in software for Q4 earnings would be challenging.Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”7. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 11%Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is a significant household and personal care product manufacturer.

Events soon overtook this commentary insofar as Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners announced that it had bought a stake in Unilever and he was invited to join the board. We are asked to suspend disbelief that this was in no way linked to the subsequent announcement that Alan Jope will be leaving the CEO role. This explanation sounds like it was lifted from the script of Miracle on 34th Street.…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

(NASDAQ: ROST) today reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter ended January 28, 2023 of $1.31 on net income of $447 million. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.04 on net earnings of $367 million for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $5.2 billion, with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 9% increase for the same period in 2021.For the 2022 fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, earnings per share were $4.38 on net income of $1.5 billion, compared to $4.87 per share on net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2021. Sales for 2022 were $18.7 billion, versus $18.9 billion in fiscal 2021, with comparable store sales down 4%, versus a robust 13% increase in the prior year.Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""During a very competitive holiday season, fourth quarter sales and earnings exceeded our guidance due to customers’ positive response to our improved assortments and stronger value offerings.""She continued, ""Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.7% compared to 9.8% in 2021. This improvement was mainly driven by lower freight and incentive costs that were partially offset by unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.""Update on Shareholder PayoutsDuring the fourth quarter and fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased a total of 2.1 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $231 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the two-year $1.9 billion program announced in March 2022. We expect to complete the $950 million remaining under this authorization in fiscal 2023.The Company’s Board of Directors also recently increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.335 per share to be payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record as of March 14, 2023.Story continuesMs. Rentler noted, ""Our stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns, as well as our confidence in the Company’s projected future cash flows and the strength of our balance sheet.""Fiscal 2023 OutlookLooking ahead, Ms. Rentler noted, ""As we enter 2023, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments remain highly uncertain. As a result, we believe it is prudent to remain conservative when planning our business.""She continued, ""While we hope to do better, for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we are planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat versus a 4% decline and a 13% gain in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024 to be $4.65 to $4.95 compared to $4.38 in fiscal 2022. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.""Ms. Rentler added, ""With elevated inflation continuing to impact our low-to-moderate income customer, we are also planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat for the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2023. This compares to a 7% decrease and a 13% gain in the first quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. If sales perform within this range, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 to be $0.99 to $1.05 versus $0.97 last year.""Ms. Rentler concluded, ""Looking ahead, we will continue strengthening our merchandise assortments by delivering great branded bargains to the consumer while also strictly controlling expenses throughout the Company. This will allow us to maximize sales and profitability in 2023 and beyond.""The Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 28, 2023 at 4:15 p.m. Eastern time to provide additional details concerning its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results, and management’s outlook for fiscal 2023.

The semiconductor industry has been very strong as well, but NVDA has dramatically outperformed the chip industry and the broader market.Nvidia is a great company, with diverse products, and a very promising future, but the valuation has gotten completely out of hand.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNvidia stock is trading at nearly 100x its TTM earnings, double its five-year median of 55x, and triple the industry average of 32x. The last time NVDA traded at a 100x multiple, which wasn’t very long ago, the stock traded down -60% over the following six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe semiconductor industry has a tendency to trade cyclically, leading economic booms and busts. NVDA is one of the strongest names in the industry because it is a household name, has benefitted massively from the gaming industry, as well as the cloud, and hypes up its AI capabilities. All of this is true, but at a certain point investors have to look for more reasonably valued companies.So how do you gain more rational access to the semiconductor industry, which is likely to boom again thanks to the new AI revolution? Even with the strength the semiconductor industry has experienced this year, there are still several companies with very reasonable valuations. Furthermore, the Zacks Rank has helped identified three semi stocks with positively trending earnings revisions.  Microchip TechnologyMicrochip Technology MCHP develops, manufactures, and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. MCHP has a comprehensive product portfolio serving over 120,000 customers across the industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, communications, and computing industries.MCHP boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter sales are expected to grow 20% to $2.2 billion, and earnings are projected to grow 19% to $1.61 per share over the same period. Full-year sales are expected to be $8.4 billion, a 24% YoY increase, while earnings are expected to climb 30% to $5.99 per share.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Analysts are in near unanimous agreement in upgrading MCHP’s earnings estimates over the last two months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMicrochip Technology is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 14x, below its five-year median of 17x, and below the industry average of 18x. MCHP also offers a dividend yield of 1.8%, which it increased 40% over the last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalog DevicesAnalog Devices ADI designs, manufactures, tests, and markets integrated circuits, software, and subsystems that leverage analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing technologies. ADI produces a range of products and serves the industrial, consumer, communications, and automotive markets.Analog Devices currently earns a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. ADI has had its earnings expectations upgraded across all timeframes, with the current year earnings revised 8% higher over the last 60 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchADI has been a steady earner, and the stock has grinded higher consistently for the last decade. Over the last 10 years ADI has almost doubled the returns of the S&amp;P 500.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalog Devices stock is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 17x, below its 10-year median of 21x, and less the one quarter of NVDA’s 76x multiple. ADM also offers a dividend of 1.9%, which it has increased by an average of 12% over the last five years.ASE TechnologyASE Technology ASX is a provider of semiconductor manufacturing services in assembly and testing.

253,872ac021-e83c-3290-af90-e2007cea5d39,SBAC,2023-03-01,Billionaire Israel Englander Is Making Huge Bets on These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-strong-buy-stocks-billionaire-215620587.html,1677621380,STORY,"['DXCM', 'SBAC']","[After the year’s early rally appeared to hit a brick wall in recent times, the markets seem uncertain which direction to take next, making the seesawing conditions not easy for investors to navigate.Against such a backdrop, maybe the best solution for investors is to follow in the footsteps of legendary Wall Street names – ones like Israel Englander.The Millennium Management Chairman and CEO founded the hedge fund in 1989 with $35 million and now the firm is an almost $53 billion going concern, so he knows a thing or two about investing. Recently, Englander has been busy padding the portfolio with some big buys, and we’ve tracked down two of his recent purchases.Do these choices sit well with the Street’s stock experts? Turns out they certainly do. According to the TipRanks database, both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. So, let’s see why these names are drawing plaudits right now.Dexcom Inc (DXCM)The first Englander-backed stock we’ll look at is medical device maker Dexcom. The San Diego, California-based company makes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems to be used by diabetes patients. The company’s solutions include wearables the Dexcom G6 and the more recent Dexcom G7, a small wearable sensor that every 5 minutes sends real-time glucose readings to a user’s smartphone and which the FDA recently cleared for usage by people with all types of diabetes ages two years and older. The company touts the product as the most accurate CGM offering on the market. Diabetes is not only a chronic disease but an increasingly prevalent one too. Dexcom’s products have been growing in popularity as seen by the steady sales gains made by the company.This was evident again in the latest quarterly statement – for 4Q22. Dexcom dialed in revenue of $815.2 million, amounting to a 16.8% year-over-year increase and meeting Street expectations. There was a conclusive beat on the bottom-line as adj. EPS of $0.34 came in ahead of the $0.28 forecast. The company also stuck to its previous 2023 guidance that calls for 15%-20% growth on the topline and gross margins of 62%-63%.Story continuesEnglander obviously sees plenty to like here. In Q4, he upped his stake in the company by more than 200% with the purchase of 2,658,077 shares. He now holds a total of 3,890,649 shares, which at the current share price are worth $431.9 million.Mirroring Englander’s confidence, Piper Sandler analyst Matt O’Brien says Dexcom is a ‘favorite name for 2023’ and highlights several reasons to get on board.“While DXCM has continued to trade sideways since November following its strong Q3 earnings, we think there is room for significant appreciation from the domestic G7 rollout, continued OUS expansion and the basal opportunity (Basal-IQ Tech uses a Dexcom G6 sensor) leading the way. Better than expected volumes and strong GM leverage give DXCM the opportunity in our view to be a beat and raise story as we move through 2023,” O’Brien opined.Unsurprisingly, then, O’Brien rates DXCM shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), backed by a $150 price target. This target brings the upside potential to 35%. (To watch O’Brien’s track record, click here)Most agree with O’Brien’s thesis. Based on 10 Buys, vs. 3 Holds, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $129.92 average target, the shares will climb 17% higher in the year ahead. (See DXCM stock forecast)SBA Communications (SBAC)On to our next Englander-endorsed name is SBA Communications (SBAC), a real estate investment trust (REIT) but a unique one at that. The Boca Raton, Florida-based company owns and operates wireless communications infrastructure and in fact is one of the largest providers of communication tower space in the United States, as well as having operations in Central America, and Brazil, Africa, and the Philippines. Its main focus is geared toward leasing of antenna space on its communications sites to a host of wireless service providers, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile.SBAC’s solid position is reflected in the company’s steadily rising revenues and earnings over the past few quarters. In the most recently reported quarter, for 4Q22, revenue rose by 15.3% from the same period a year ago to $686.1 million, beating the Street’s call by $4.81 million. However, while net income increased significantly from $48.9 million in 4Q21 to $102.6 million and resulting in $0.94 per share, the figure fell short of the $1.11 expected by the analysts.Englander enters the frame here via a big increase to his holdings in Q4. He purchased 594,994 shares in the quarter, upping his stake by almost 300% and now holds a total of 797,089 shares, at present worth north of $206 million.Englander is obviously upbeat about SBAC’s future and so is Raymond James analyst Ric Prentiss, who writes: “SBAC is our current preferred tower stock due to its: 1) larger exposure to U.S. towers; 2) higher quality AFFO; 3) longer runway for strong dividend growth (the company currently pays a quarterly cash dividend of $0.85 per share); and 4) proven ability to opportunistically allocate capital including stock buybacks.”Based on that assessment, Prentiss rates SBAC a Strong Buy and has a price target set at $334. Should that figure be met, investors will be sitting on returns of ~29% a year from now. (To watch Prentiss’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, where SBAC gets plenty of support. Barring two skeptics, all 10 other recent analyst reviews are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. Shares are expected to appreciate by ~27% in the year ahead, considering the average target stands at $328.82.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Stocks to Buy for High Returns. 2023 so far is shaping out to be a see saw of a year for the stock market. Battered and bruised by high inflation and interest rates last year, growth and technology companies had a good start with significant share price gains after big chunks of their market values were wiped off between January and December 2022. This wipeout also affected those that had invested in such firms, with their biggest cheerleader, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest's flagship Ark Innovation fund taking a beating that is the stuff of nightmares. As trading ended in December 2022, this flagship fund which has invested in big ticket names such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and others such as Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) had dropped by a whopping 67% year to date, 3x the losses posted by the S&amp;P 500 stock market index. These losses were fueled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike policies, which increased the returns offered by safe investments and reduced the growth premium of the stock market.Entering 2023, the stock market was in for some much-needed returns. Tesla, whose shares were among the worst performers last year, is now up 81% year to date. Another widely talked about example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) whose shares had dropped by an eye popping 61% in 2022 gained 36% year to date. However, just as the growth industry started to make a comeback, inflation reared its head again. Data released by the United States Department of Commerce on February 24, 2023, showed that Fed's preferred consumer prices gauge rose by 5.4% annually and 0.6% sequentially in January, edging higher from December's reading. Similarly, core inflation which removes the effects of food and energy prices - both of which have soared since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year - jumped 0.6% sequentially and 4.7% annually during the same month, edging higher once again.Story continuesSubsequently, the stock market dropped with Tesla and Meta's shares going down by 3% and 1.37%, respectively. At the same time, the U.S. dollar - the world's premium safe haven investment - jumped to a seven week high, posting a two month high against the Japanese Yen and increasing in value against the British Pound and Euro as well. Mazen Issa, an FX strategist at TD Securities summed the current volatility in the market perfectly as he outlined to Reuters:""I think (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell floated the mission accomplished banner way too soon this month, just ahead of the payrolls report. Certainly, it looks like his comments were poorly placed. And it looks like the markets have priced out any chance of a cut this year, which is a sizable shift given that barely four weeks ago, the market was looking at cuts in the second half of this year. That adjustment is a dollar-positive dynamic.""As the turmoil continues this year, Fisher Investments' head Mr. Ken Fisher shared his thoughts on how investors can set their portfolio up for a market recovery in 2023 as he explained in a February 2023 fireside chat:But what I want you to see is that you can just simply go and look at what was hurt more in the bear market and load up on those categories of things. And in the bounce period, you'll do better. Diversify amongst it, but you'll do better. Now I want you to see how much that's often counter to normal human instincts. Normal human instincts want to say, I wanna buy and own the things that didn't do badly in the bear market. And so you can see in public commentary a lot of favorability let's say towards energy. Which did really well in the course of the bear market. The fact of the matter is, those things that did well in the bear market, like energy, tend to do badly in the bounce. There's reasons for that, I don't really need to go on the details with energy but you can see it as a juxtaposition off the bottom between energy on the one hand and let's say growth-y stocks on the other. Tech or not, whether they're tech stocks or non tech growth-y stocks. So I encourage you to just think in that simple framework of things that got battered more, like consumer durables, that are inherently economically sensitive, things like tech, growth stocks in general. Those, because they got battered more, tend to bounce more. Because they got battered more, you tend to be afraid of them. That fear is actually your friend if you let it be. And that's the way to think of that in roughly the first third of this next bull market.He added that if the market drops, then these same stocks will perform badly too but then bounce more later.Today, we will look at some stocks that have posted high returns lately, with the top picks being S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Payment Companies in the World. The advent of the Internet has revolutionized business and created new technologies for people to conduct their daily lives. One such area is business, where firms now have access to a global workforce that lets them offshore their tasks to employees in other countries to save up on costs. At the same time, firms can collect their payments digitally as well, which reduces the need of keeping cash at hand for both them and the consumer.At the heart of this facilitation is the payments processing industry. This industry started up along with the internet, as PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) became one of the first firms that disrupted the traditional banking model and enabled users to make and accept payments over the Internet. Since then, both traditional players and new entrants have entered into the market. As a result, the global payments industry was worth a whopping $92 billion in 2021 according to research from Precedence Research. From this, it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.49% until 2030, by the end of which the firm believes it will have an estimated market value of $572 billion.Within the market, there are a couple of trends that are contributing to its growth. These include the widespread adoption of smartphones, which provide users with a convenient way to manage their finances by easily accessing the Internet and using software applications. Additionally, and particularly as the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated, the demand for online shopping is immense, due to the convenience offered in both browsing through items and receiving them without having to leave the comfort of one's home. Zooming in on different industry segments, the one dealing with plastic currency or debit cards forms the largest segment, and companies are also increasingly starting to rely on the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to weed out fraudulent activities on their platform. Artificial intelligence, as futuristic as it sounds, is simply an advanced form of linear regression that reaches conclusions about a set of data points by either using pre-fed parameters or evaluating new data sets. Within fraud detection, this generally involves taking a database of previously fraudulent transactions, and using their specific parameters, such as frequency, amount, and location, to train the algorithm for future events.Story continuesAccounting and financial firm Deloitte takes a deeper look within the industry to further closely analyze what lies in the future for this disruptive and critical sector. It explains that instantaneous - or real time - payment processing will continue to expand in the U.S. as it will expand its coverage to also include business to business and business to consumer use cases. These involve areas such as payroll processing and more. Deloitte adds that the growth of gig economies is also fueling digital payments since workers in several areas do not have access to the traditional financial system such as banking accounts. Deloitte adds that a crucial market area that is gaining traction these days is one where companies act as an intermediary between a bank that has issued a plastic currency card and the merchant that is accepting payments from the card.As the industry starts to mature and more firms enter, existing players are looking at means to improve their customer relationships to retain market share. This was also on PayPal's chief executive officer (CEO) Mr. Daniel Schulman's mind as he explained the steps that his firm is taking to improve the customer shopping experience and improve the ease with which they can carry out transactions with each other. Mr. Schulman's comments came during his company's earnings call for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 as he outlined:We are putting significant resources behind the modernization of our checkout experience in order to defend and grow our market share in our branded checkout business. This includes a drive towards passwordless, one click native in-app experiences as well as deploying the next generation of advanced checkout using our data and AI capabilities. Although this will be a multiyear initiative and will take time given the scale of our base and our legacy integrations, I am extremely pleased with the progress we made last year. We will continue to deliver scaled growth for Braintree. And last year, we made significant progress in modernizing our architecture and capabilities. These improvements resulted in a substantial number of new sales and incremental volume from existing accounts.In addition, we have an impressive pipeline of opportunity for 2023. In the first half of this year, we intend to fully ramp our unbranded offering to small and midsized businesses, either directly or through channel partners. The launch of PPCP, or PayPal Complete Payments, will meaningfully expand our unbranded total addressable market by as much as $750 billion, and enables us to drive incremental share with higher margins than our Braintree Enterprise service. On the consumer side, we’ll continue to enhance our digital wallet value proposition. We are focused on the end-to-end customer experience, from onboarding to the entirety of the consumer life cycle, utilizing more advanced forms of AI to drive optimal consumer choices. In the past two years, we have introduced a significant number of products and services.Today, we'll look at some of the largest payment companies in the world, with the top picks being Visa Inc.

Secure your seat todayU.S. payments giant Visa (V) remains committed to investing in the crypto sector and supporting the technology despite recent failures in the industry, the company said Tuesday.Reuters reported earlier Tuesday that Visa is “slamming the brakes” on new partnerships with crypto-related firms as the industry is facing renewed scrutiny after the collapse of once-popular crypto exchange FTX.A Visa spokesperson told CoinDesk that isn’t the case.“The recent failures do not change our crypto strategy and focus to serve as a bridge, helping connect both platforms and technologies emerging in the crypto ecosystem,” the spokesperson said. “That is where we have been investing and plan to continue to invest.”In a tweet on Tuesday, Visa’s head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, said reports of Visa wanting to slow down partnerships with the crypto space are inaccurate, and he reiterated that Visa continues to partner with crypto companies.“Despite the challenges and uncertainty in the crypto ecosystem, our view has not changed that fiat-backed digital currencies running on public blockchains have the potential to play an important role in the payments ecosystem,” Sheffield said.Visa recently signed a long-term global partnership with crypto payments app Wirex to expand its footprint in Asia-Pacific (APAC) and the U.K., to bring more payment options to consumers.Mastercard was also reported to be taking a step back in the crypto space. A spokesperson from Mastercard, however, told CoinDesk the company still intends to ""work with partners to bring relevant payments solutions and programs to market.""The person added, ""Our efforts continue to be focused on the underlying blockchain technology and how that can be applied to help address current pain points and build more efficient systems for consumers and businesses.""UPDATE (Feb. 28, 2023 19:59 UTC): Adds comments from Mastercard spokesperson.]"

The collaboration will be the first of its kind for the hotel industry and marks the next step in Marriott's commitment to address a critical human rights issue for the industry. Marriott recently marked a significant milestone in its anti-trafficking efforts, training one million associates at Marriott hotels to recognize and respond to signs of human trafficking.Marriott International has joined forces with Internet Watch Foundation.In January 2023, Marriott established a new Global Property Network Standard to have hotels block access to websites with CSAM from the hotels' guest network.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most profitable companies in the world.There is a great divide in the finance world between revenue, growth and profit. Often times, the focus is on companies who either have already demonstrated significant, or in most cases, companies which have the potential for massive growth in the future, as that will lead to a greater valuation and hence, a greater return for shareholders. Growth here refers to revenue growth and often, targets are set based on expected revenue in the future based on various analytics and data. When a company is newly incorporated with great potential, even though revenue continues to increase significantly year on year, it is generally loss making except in some specific circumstances, due to a lack of economies of scale and high fixed costs and capital investment. Therefore, at this juncture, it is generally the gross margin, or revenue less cost of goods sold, which show the variable profit of a company, which is considered to be an important metric, even though revenue growth is still perhaps the most important factor at this stage.25 most profitable companies in the worldNAR studio/Shutterstock.comHowever, for shareholders of major companies, both public and profit, net profit is one of the most important metrics to consider, which shows the profit of a company after all expenses have been deducted, including both variable and fixed costs, not to mention other expenses such as interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Net profit is what goes to shareholders in the form of dividends, though the majority of their return comes from an increase in the value of the company.One amazing example of a company focusing on growth instead of revenue early on, and which was one of the most profitable companies in the world according to Forbes Global 2000, is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). When Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) started out, for several years, it was a lossmaking company even as its revenue saw outstanding growth and the company dominated the online retailer industry. The company adopted a policy of providing extremely low prices to attract customers and driving out competitors while hemorrhaging money, as losses continued to pile up. It took Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) 14 years to make as much profit as it did finally in the last quarter in 2018. Now, it is easily one of the biggest companies in the world as its dominance only continues to improve, with Jeff Bezos's policy of growth over meeting quarterly earnings targets achieved great success in the long term. Many other companies, though, are not so lucky, as consistently making losses is not generally a viable strategy long term.Story continuesHowever, in this ever-advancing world, profit is no longer the only important consideration for shareholder; environmental, social and governance (ESG) has made its mark, which is why some of the most profitable companies in the world also have a lot in common with the biggest ESG companies in the world. Considering the negative impacts major companies have on the environment and climate change, there has been significant backlash against their practices, which is why companies have had to focus more on sustainability in addition to profits, and make significant investments to bring to fruition their ambitious ESG targets. While ESG was initiated decades ago, the world has started taking it much more seriously now, since the impact of climate change isn't just known, but is being felt across the world.To determine the most profitable companies in the world was not an easy task. To start off, we obtained profits on the top 2000 companies in the world courtesy of Forbes. We then filtered the 50 companies with the highest profits, and updated the profit figures based on the trailing twelve month profits from Yahoo Finance. Remember, even though some of them may have made losses recently, they are traditionally among the most profitable companies in this world, and hence, deserving of a place in this list. We have also only focused on net income from continuing operations to truly reflect a company's profitability. Some energy companies, as a result of the Russia Ukraine war and the increase in energy prices, have recorded their best ever profits in history and hence, jumped several places in this list. So, let's take a look at the companies which combined reported profits of well over $950 billion, starting with (all TTM net profit figures are in millions):25.

(NYSE:VZ) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/63-ownership-verizon-communications-inc-140014941.html,1677592814,STORY,['VZ'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Verizon Communications' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions39% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockA look at the shareholders of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Verizon Communications, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Verizon Communications already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Verizon Communications' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Verizon Communications. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.2% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Verizon Communications Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$38m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Dayton, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but is unbeaten in every single category measured including accessibility, speed, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results show remarkable speeds for Verizon customers in Dayton with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 110% in the market and Verizon’s median upload speeds increasing by more than 54% since last year*.“Whether our customers are enjoying connecting with friends and family while on the move, connecting their smart homes through one of our home internet products or using our service in Dayton for small business or enterprise applications, we know customers count on us,” said Dean Brauer, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our team has been working hard in Dayton to deliver these results, and we are not slowing down.”Network enhancements in DaytonThese top marks are a result of months of deploying new enhancements in the network for those who live in and visit the Dayton area. Network engineers have been busy deploying 5G Ultra Wideband service throughout Dayton, with 5G now available throughout downtown, Webster Station, Linden Heights, the Historic Inner East, South Park, the University of Dayton, Walnut Hills, and Burkhardt. Additionally, on the west side, customers in Wolf Creek, Old Dayton, Grafton Hill, and University Row/Princeton Heights now have access to Verizon’s reliable 5G Ultra Wideband service. Verizon engineers also constructed a macro cell site which is adding capacity and coverage for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.Story continuesThese deployments used a combination of Verizon’s high band mmWave spectrum and its recently acquired C-band spectrum. Until this year in Dayton, Verizon has been restricted to using 60 MHz of the spectrum they secured, but by the end of this year, customers in Dayton will be able to take advantage of 100 MHz of C-band, almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Dayton. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Dayton area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Dayton, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with truly unlimited broadband service and no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Additionally, through Verizon Frontline, first responders in the Dayton area will also be able to experience the benefits of these network enhancements. So for customers living in or traveling to Dayton, Ohio, Verizon has a network they can count on.*Rankings based on the RootMetrics® Dayton RootScore® Report: 1H 2023.

In order to keep ahead of that increase in data usage, Verizon’s network engineers have added capacity to over 140 cell sites in the last six months and they have deployed a new macro cell site along the Michigan and Ohio borders for customers traveling the interstate. These enhancements will be particularly impactful for customers in Lincolnshire, Elmhurst, Library Village, Downtown Toledo, Rossford, Heather Downs, Perrysburg, and Maumee. With these enhancements, customers in the area can do everything from downloading huge documents and seamlessly streaming movies in HD audio and video, to playing console quality games and conducting video chats and video conferencing calls with clear sound and video while on the move.Story continuesServices from the network customers rely onFor customers in Toledo, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with truly unlimited broadband service and no data caps.

271,cf172b1a-d715-32b8-b4c7-4a9bc9bf328a,TPR,2023-03-01,W.W. Grainger and Southwest Airlines have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/w-w-grainger-southwest-airlines-142102389.html,1677594062,STORY,"['LUV', 'GWW', 'GIS', 'TPR', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 28, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares W.W. Grainger GWW as the Bull of the Day and Southwest Airlines LUV as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tapestry, Inc. TPR, Conagra CAG and General Mills, Inc. GIS.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Incorporated in 1928, Illinois-based Zacks Rank #1 stock (Strong Buy) W.W. Grainger is a distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) products and services. Its products include material-handling equipment, safety and security supplies, lighting and electrical products, power and hand tools, pumps and plumbing supplies, cleaning and maintenance supplies, and metalworking tools. Grainger’s largest market is North America; however, the company has expanded internationally to Asia, Europe, and South America. The company serves a broad swath of clientele, including the commercial, manufacturing, government, and transportation industries.Q4 Earnings SummaryGrainger reported strong earnings, growing sales, and expanding margins in early February. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.14 in Q4 2022, beating the Zacks Consensus by a margin of 2%. The bottom line improved by 31% year-over-year. Sales rose ~17% year-over-year amid solid new customer acquisition numbers.Fundamental Highlights include:EPS Growth: GWW’s earnings grew 33% year-over-year in Q4 2022. Grainger has benefitted from volume growth in its two primary businesses: High Tech Solutions and Endless Assortment.Surprise History:Grainger consistently beats consensus analyst expectations. The company has rewarded investors with positive earnings surprises for six straight quarters.On average, GWW bests consensus estimates by ~9%.Efficient Business: Grainger is seeing larger margins due to rising profits from its pandemic-related products, lower freight costs, and its ability to navigate supply-chain challenges. From a return on equity perspective (ROE), GWW is one of the strongest companies on Wall Street. GWW boasts an ROE of 60.13 – a staggering number compared to the Industrial Services industry average of 5.53%.Story continuesPast Performance: Adjusted EPS surged 49.5% year-over-year to $29.66 in 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.47. Including one-time items, EPS was $30.06 in 2022 compared with $19.84 in 2021. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus estimate of $15.19 billion. Sales were up 19.3% on a daily, constant currency basis.Rosy Outlook: Consensus analyst estimates show that analysts are becoming more bullish on GWW earnings picture. Because of this, GWW earns a Zacks #1 Rank, putting it in the top 5% of stocks tracked by Zacks.Technical Picture: Following the Q4 EPS release, GWW shares bolted higher by 13% on volume more than double the norm – a bullish sign of accumulation. Since then, shares have been consolidating in a bull flag.A break out above the recent high will present investors with an attractive reward-to-risk zone.Bear of the Day:Based in Dallas, TX, Southwest Airlines is a low-cost airline provider mainly servicing the United States and “ten near-international” markets. Southwest provides short-haul, high-frequency, point-to-point, low-fare services. The company’s point-to-point route structure includes services to and from many secondary or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, and Ft-Lauderdale-Hollywood.Low Cost = Low PerformanceLow-cost carriers like Spiritand Southwest have been dramatically underperforming their larger peers such as United.What's Behind the Underperformance?Unprofitable and moving in the wrong direction: In Q4, Southwest Airlines swung to a loss for the first time in three quarters. The 38-cent loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Adding to the disappointment, Southwest earned 14 cents a year ago.Operational Disruptions: Massive flight cancellations due to extreme winter weather conditions adversely impacted Southwest’s operations. Because Southwest is more focused on one part of the globe when compared to its larger counterparts, the company suffered more. Nearly 17,000 flights were cancelled in the last ten days of 2022 – equating to a pre-tax negative impact of approximately $800 million.In-Fighting &amp; Bad Publicity: Southwest is known and loved by its customers because of the laid-back nature of its flight attendants and employees. This laissez faire attitude is that Southwest management has found that many customers appreciate a less stuffy environment. However, that may change soon.Southwest management and some 18,000 union workers have been in a contract dispute for months. In an era where workers are in high demand, this is not an encouraging sign for Southwest. Until management and the union come to an agreement, the stock is likely to be under pressure. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached, the low-cost carrier will likely face reputational damage and low employee morale.Margins Being Squeezed: Rising fuel and labor costs are causing Southwest’s financial efficiency to take a significant hit. In fact, LUV’s return-on-equity of 6.7% pales in comparison to the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 26.2%.Relative Weakness: When it comes to the stock market, price action = truth. Over the past six months, United Airlines is up 41.0%, while Southwest is down 10.4%ConclusionProspective airline investors should avoid low-cost carriers, such as Southwest and instead opt for larger players such as United Airlines. Southwest has slower growth, shrinking margins, and notable reputational damage to contend with. Furthermore, the price action is disheartening when compared to the market and the airline group.Additional content:E-Commerce Sales to Hit New Highs: 3 Stocks to BuyE-commerce has played a major role in driving retail sales ever since the onset of the pandemic. Although life has bounced back to normal, the spending habit of consumers has changed drastically over the past couple of years, with an increasing number of people shopping online.Be it consumer staples, discretionary items, or consumer durable goods, people are today more confident making their purchases online. This has also made retailers’ online shopping and delivery arms stronger. Given this scenario, stocks like Tapestry, Inc., Conagra and General Mills, Inc. are likely to benefit in the near term.Online Shopping Boosts Retail SalesThe Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 3% month over month in January, surpassing economists’ expectations of a jump of 1.9%. E-commerce once again played a major role in driving overall retail sales, as online sales grew 1.3% month over month.E-commerce has emerged as the most popular mode of shopping. Millions of people chose to shop from home throughout the pandemic due to fears of contracting the COVID-19 virus. They finally understood the benefits of online purchasing as a result of this. Since then, the tendency has prevailed and significantly aided the retail industry.This comes as e-commerce retail sales crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time in 2022. According to ComScore’s annual State of Digital Commerce report, online sales hit $1.09 trillion in 2022, climbing 11% from $904.3 billion recorded in 2021. Overall online sales increased 18% year over year in the fourth quarter.E-Commerce Poised to GrowPeople have been shopping online for years but e-commerce got a boost only after the pandemic, and since then, it has been capturing more market share almost every day. According to a Forbes report, 20.8% of overall retail purchases are expected to be done online in 2023.A physical presence is thus no longer a top priority, with retailers shifting focus toward having a solid web presence that will allow a low barrier to entry for consumers. The report also mentions that 24% of retail purchases will be online by 2026.E-commerce sales are expected to grow 10.3% in 2023, while the global e-commerce market is poised to hit $6.3 trillion in 2023. The U.S. e-commerce market, in particular, is expected to hit $8.1 trillion by 2026.Our ChoicesThis is, thus, the right opportunity to invest in retail stocks that have a strong online presence.Tapestry, Inc.is the designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men in the United States and internationally.

Despite the ongoing inventory correction in gaming, shares rose over 20% during the fourth quarter because of continued resilience in the company’s data center segment, which beat expectations and grew more than 30% year-over-year, driven by robust demand for accelerating computing graphic processing units (GPUs) to power data-intensive, AI, and cloud workloads. Along these lines, the company announced an agreement with Microsoft and Oracle, in which it will go to market together with these cloud providers, getting a revenue share for the usage by Microsoft/Oracle end customers of NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud as well as NVIDIA’s AI Enterprise software suite as a service. This strategic announcement should both reduce hurdles for AI adoption in vertical industries as well as drive incremental usage-based, high-margin revenues for NVIDIA. In addition, OpenAI’s ChatGPT uses NVIDIA GPUs to train its models and runs on NVDIA GPUs in the Microsoft Azure cloud to provide its answers.

The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and its tactical approaches to accelerate growth also buoy optimism. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and a soft volume environment are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 5.1% against the 17.5% decline of the industry and the 9.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of diagnostic information services has a market capitalization of $15.44 billion. The company projects 2.4% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Quest Diagnostics surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 7%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Base Volume Improves: We are optimistic about Quest Diagnostics’ base testing volumes or base business, which refers to testing volumes excluding COVID-19 testing. The company is increasing its efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in the base business. Quest Diagnostics continued to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2022.Accelerate Growth Strategy Bodes Well: Quest Diagnostics continues to progress in terms of its tactical approaches to accelerate growth, the first part of its two-point strategy, raising our optimism. In terms of growth through M&amp;A, the company has announced an outreach lab purchase from Ohio-based Summa Health. Quest Diagnostics has also announced a professional lab services relationship with Southwest Florida-based Lee Health to provide supply-chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee Health and selected outpatient centers.To accelerate growth through health plan access, the company continued to gain traction with value-based contracts, where it sees higher growth than traditional contracts.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: Quest Diagnostics’ better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 earnings and revenues buoy our optimism. During the reported quarter, the base business registered growth and the company has also ramped up investments to accelerate growth in the base business, particularly in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing.DownsidesStiff Competition: Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market, compared to Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including the accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs primarily based on the quality of service.Soft Volume Environment: Pressure on volume, owing to a difficult macroeconomic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, was down 11.2% year over year in the fourth quarter. Revenues per requisition declined 5.1% year over year due to lower COVID-19 molecular testing volume.Estimate TrendQuest Diagnostics has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023.

High levels of retention, improved pricing, an increase in new business and a positive renewal premium change should continue to drive Travelers. For 2023, the insurer expects renewal premium change to continue to remain strong with the implementation of additional insured value increases.TRV expects domestic automobile renewal premium change to be in the mid-teens throughout 2023.Given an improving rate environment, the insurer expects after-tax fixed income net investment income, including earnings from short-term securities to average above $535 million per quarter in 2023 with an estimated $515 million in the first quarter. Higher average levels of invested assets, reliable results from the fixed-income portfolio and strong returns from the non-fixed income portfolio are likely to drive the metric higher.The property and casualty insurer maintains a conservative balance sheet among its peers. The debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity) was within the insurer’s target of 15% to 25%.Travelers has an impressive dividend history, increasing its dividend for the last 18 years.

287,78d9739b-fb48-3de3-8d24-c1580de6cb16,APD,2023-03-01,Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-products-chemicals-nyse-apd-120044658.html,1677672044,STORY,"['APD', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals What Is Air Products and Chemicals's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2022 Air Products and Chemicals had US$8.16b of debt, an increase on US$7.43b, over one year. However, it does have US$3.17b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$4.99b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Air Products and Chemicals' Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Air Products and Chemicals had liabilities of US$3.28b due within a year, and liabilities of US$10.5b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$3.17b as well as receivables valued at US$2.16b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$8.43b.Story continuesOf course, Air Products and Chemicals has a titanic market capitalization of US$63.5b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Air Products and Chemicals has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.3. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 18.4 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Fortunately, Air Products and Chemicals grew its EBIT by 9.8% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Air Products and Chemicals can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Looking at the most recent three years, Air Products and Chemicals recorded free cash flow of 23% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.Our ViewAir Products and Chemicals's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. All these things considered, it appears that Air Products and Chemicals can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Air Products and Chemicals  that you should be aware of.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Income-generating stocks are all the rage as the stock market suffered huge losses last year. According to a report by Reuters, Wall Street recorded its biggest annual drop in 2022 since the financial crisis of 2008, as the S&amp;P 500 shed nearly $8 trillion in market cap. Growth stocks also recorded their worst performance in a decade, turning investors’ attention toward overlooked dividend equities.Quality companies that have raised their payouts for a significant period are considered safe during fluctuating market conditions. Historical analysis of these stocks shows that they have outperformed their peers when turbulence in the market occurs. Over the past five decades, dividend growers have surpassed other asset classes when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually, as reported by Sterling Capital. Another reason why dividends make reliable investments is due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. According to a report by Schroders, the average annual return across eight markets was 4.3% in the last 25 years, which increased to an average of 7.1% including reinvested dividends.Analysts often advise investing in companies that have proven track records of dividend growth, as these companies are likely to continue growing their payouts in the long term. In addition to this, such companies are considered less risky as they have stable cash flows and histories of profitability. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some major dividend companies with solid dividend growth streaks and strong balance sheets. In view of this, we will discuss the best consistent dividend stocks to buy in this article.Story continues16 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for at least 10 years.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We believe shorting furniture retailers has arguably become a consensus view on the back of widely known tough comps from early 2021 (+26% and +40% SSS Comps for WSM in calendar Q1/Q2 ‘21) and fear of pull forward of demand, which seems to be corroborated by weak credit card data in the category the last few weeks and a poor outlook from furniture e-Commerce giant Wayfair, not to mention a panic-inducing, rambling conference call from the oft colorful CEO of Restoration Hardware. Lazy thematic macro analysis that stops there, however, paints an incomplete picture of what has transpired at many individual companies like WSM that have been deemed COVID beneficiaries that are now at all-time low valuations.WSM is a furniture and home décor retailer that owns several well-known brands: William Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Rejuvenation, Mark &amp; Graham, and most importantly, west elm. While perhaps thought of as a dying mall-based brick &amp; mortar retailer, WSM derives the vast majority (66%+) of its revenue from e-Commerce and has been a remarkably steady performer, remaining free cash flow positive every year since at least 2007 and achieving positive same store sales comps since 2010, including +17% in 2020, +22% in 2021 with guidance for a further mid-to-high single digit growth again this year. Within the overall positive sales trends, west elm’s consistent growth has been even more impressive, with a 16% average annual same-store sales growth rate since 2012. To little fanfare, by our calculation, WSM has become the single highest quality retailer in public markets with a 58% return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2021 and a 39% ROIC on average over the past 3 years…” (Click here to see the full text)14.

The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)10. Waste Management, Inc.

It may seem strange to sell a position with this backdrop, but I did so for two reasons. First, it was purchased in the first place as a reasonably priced defensive during an orgy of speculation. In this context, CASY served its purpose. Second, given the developments of the past year and Upslope’s overall still-defensive portfolio, I think there are better uses of capital today – specifically cheaper, less-defensive longs. Some of these are highlighted in Exhibit 4 below.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles:Top Investors' Stocks Portfolio: Mid-Cap Stocks12 High Growth Software Stocks that are Profitable12 High Growth Healthcare Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

Here's a quote for you. Today, the corporate kingdom comes to an end. That's what Florida governor Ron Desantis said about a new state law giving his hand-picked board control of the Reedy Creek Improvement District. That's the body that gives Disney unique authority and has for several decades. Richard Foglesong is the author of Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando. Also with us today is Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal. All right. Good to see you, Richard. What is the impact of that new Florida law on Disney?RICHARD FOGLESONG: Yeah. Well, I think the good governor overstated the case. A year ago in the summer, when this came before the state legislature, he spoke of disillusion as the only solution to the powers that had been granted to the Disney Company. Well, it wasn't dissolved. Their special purpose government was not dissolved. It had special powers, and it still has those powers. Maybe they will do yet what he said they would do.I think the good question now is what will be the impact of the new board that he appointed. Instead of having a board of supervisors for this thing called the Reedy Creek Improvement District appointed by the landowner, which is the Disney Company, now we have a five-member board of supervisors that consists principally of cultural warrior types, Christian nationalist types, like the good governor himself.ALLIE CANAL: All right, Richard. So let's pick up on that board. What do you make of that, and how could it potentially impact Disney?RICHARD FOGLESONG: Well, I think there is an issue here. The Disney Company is the major manufacturer of culture in the United States. And when you have people appointed to a board who can appropriately, fairly, by their own description, be called cultural warriors and Christian nationalists. At least one of whom, Moms for Liberty, who's concerned about whether the wrong books are being offered in school libraries, I think that's a combustible mix of culture manufacturers and people who want to regulate what books may be offered in public schools.Story continuesALLIE CANAL: So you think that this whole bill could impact Disney on a cultural level, but in terms of the day to day operations, we will likely not see too much impact?RICHARD FOGLESONG: No. I don't think we'll see a lot of change day to day, but you've got folks who are different here now running the company. Before, the board of supervisors, the people who work for the Reedy Creek Improvement District and the top executives at the Disney Company at Disney World, I should say, they literally wore the same nametags. A Mickey Mouse nametag. I don't see that happening anymore. I don't see them being part of the same team.And the question that arises then is whether they will use their separate authority, the board and the top executives, as a way to leverage the other party. I could imagine the board of supervisors wanting to do that, and I could imagine Disney resisting that as well. We'll see whether that occurs.- Yeah. It's interesting. Now we reached out to Disney for comment. They did not say a word. And it has been interesting, Richard, that they haven't really said a word since Bob Iger returned. It seems at least on the outside, that they think they can ignore this problem, and Ron Desantis will move on to other things and run for president.Speaking of Bob Iger, what's your interpretation? What's your reaction to his reorganization, how he'll put ESPN on a silo? And will ESPN remain a part of Disney in the long run?RICHARD FOGLESONG: Yeah. I think Bob Iger is good for the company, and I always have. I worry a bit whether he may have too much confidence in his own charm, here dealing with a good governor. This governor is serious about what he proposes. He's brought a new program of cultural warfare to the republican party, and he's willing to address or trample on the free speech rights of major corporations in America.Look. American corporations, as you well know from your beat, they are woke. That's apparent in their corporate advertising, whether it comes to multiracial couples, gay families, and whatnot, as depicted in corporate advertising. And I can't imagine that major corporations engaged in that kind of advertising are going to look with favor on a presidential candidate who was willing, at least in the case of the Disney Company, to trample on their free speech rights. That's going to be an issue. I think it's going to be an issue for the Republican Party.ALLIE CANAL: So Richard, given all the issues that Disney has faced, both internally and externally, how critical do you think it was for Bob Iger to return to the company as CEO? And what should that succession strategy look like after he's supposed to leave in two years?RICHARD FOGLESONG: Yeah. The other Bob, Chapek, wasn't getting the job done and took some wrong steps with the governor of Florida here. But what we have to remember when we talk about this issue of wokeness, I have a good friend, an AP reporter, who's coming out with a book on costume characters at Disney and the way in which they're treated both by the labor union there and by the company.And Disney has a lot of gay employees. And there was those gay employees who pushed Bob Chapek to talk back to Governor Desantis. Now that issue is not going to go away. So how is Bob Iger going to be able to keep his costume character employees happy at Disney World and at the same time, maintain good relations with the governor of Florida?- Just one of dozens of challenges ahead, including succession for Bob Iger. Richard Foglesong and Allie Canal, thank you, both. Appreciate that.RICHARD FOGLESONG: Thank you.]"

If you want to skip the investment philosophy of Ken Fisher and the detailed analysis of Fisher Asset Management, go directly to Ken Fisher's 5 New Purchases/Additions.Ken Fisher, the founder, executive chairman and co-chief investment officer of Fisher Asset Management, predicts that the market conditions in 2023 will resemble those of 1967, as outlined in an article posted in the New York Post. In 1966, inflation was high, there were concerns about a possible recession, and the US Federal Reserve was increasing benchmark interest rates to counter inflation. The S&amp;P 500 Index experienced a 22% decline that year, similar to the 2022 market conditions. However, the market recovered in the fourth quarter of 1966, with a 6% gain, and recorded a YoY rise of 24% in 1967. The current market has also staged a comeback, with a 7.2% gain since October 2022.In one of the interviews, Ken Fisher suggested that investors can position their portfolio to benefit from a new bull market bounce by investing in categories that have dropped the most during the bear market. He said that we are currently in the early stages of a new bull market that began in October 2022 and expects sectors that were hurt the most last year, such as information technology and other growth-oriented sectors, to perform well in the first part of this new bull market. Ken Fisher also noted that sectors and categories that did well during the recent bear market, such as energy, tend to underperform during the initial bull market bounce, which may seem counterintuitive to some investors. Ken Fisher's 15 New Purchases/AdditionsRegardless of whether a new bull market is already underway or not, Ken advised investors to expect the market to bounce in the near future and suggests investing in categories that suffered the most during the downturn as a way to benefit during a market recovery.Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management 13F portfolio value also increased from $133.41 billion in Q3 to $147.93 billion in Q4 2022. The fund made 145 new purchases in the fourth quarter, additional purchases in 440 stocks, sold out 168 equities, and reduced holdings in 389 stocks. Some of the popular companies in which Ken Fisher made additional/new purchases in his Q4 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we focused on the top 100 positions and identified the biggest additions/purchases in the fourth quarter of 2022.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the new purchases/addition in Ken Fisher’s 13F investment portfolio. Madison Funds made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) reported a disappointing fourth quarter with revenue and earnings below consensus which was followed by the board replacing then-CEO Bob Chapek and the return of Bob Iger as CEO. Parks remained a bright spot while losses at direct-to-consumer increased and linear networks continued to be challenged by cord cutting.”14. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 7%Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a general merchandise shop in the United States.

Although sales were slightly better than expected, Target saw a slowdown in discretionary sales. Gross margins were below expectations with higher markdowns, increased shrink, and incremental costs. Long-term, we expect Target to be able to return to operating margins in the 6% to 8% range as inventories return to normal levels as well as seeing a normalization in supply chain costs.”13. Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 8%Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) produces and distributes industrial items and equipment worldwide. The firm also enjoys a wide range of competitive advantages supporting long-term EPS growth and sustainable earnings. Among these are Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW)’s enormous economies of scale, providing a price advantage and greater resources for investment in R&amp;D and marketing compared to its rivals.

Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 8%Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) provides a variety of business and retail banking, credit card, and other financial services. With over 100 million clients, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is a major participant in the credit card industry. In the past, the corporation has targeted customers with less-than-ideal credit ratings with its offers. What is shockingly obscure, though, is that Capital One is one of the largest full-fledged banks in the country, in addition to being the principal lender behind its cards. It presently holds assets worth close to $400 billion and loans totaling more than $300 billion.Securities filings for the third quarter of 2015 reveal that Ken Fisher added Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) to his portfolio by acquiring 7,189 shares worth $521,000. In the fourth quarter of 2022, he increased his stake in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by 8%, and his 0.58% stake in the company is now worth about $870.33 million.Based on 6 buy ratings, 6 hold ratings, and 3 sell recommendations, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has a consensus rating of ‘Hold.’ Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)’s largest investor is Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates, which owns 12.60 million shares of the company.Here is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Additionally, we initiated a position in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) during the quarter. Capital One is one of the largest issuers of Visa and Mastercard credit cards in the U.S. The company also has a banking network, offers auto and home loans, and manages assets for institutional and high-net-worth clients. We like that Capital One possesses a strong capital position and a common equity tier-1 ratio that exceeds both regulators’ requirements as well as the company’s own internal target. We appreciate the company’s good underwriting track record and its history of lower than expected loss rates given its business mix and yield. In our view, Capital One’s management team is focused on the long term as evidenced by its consistent reinvestment in technology development, and its online/branch bank provides a stable deposit base with decent funding cost. At roughly 5x 2022 consensus earnings and 1.1x tangible book value per share, the stock trades at a significant discount to the market and our estimate of intrinsic value.”]11. Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) creates, produces, commissions, and retrofits building systems and products internationally and in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

This represents 0.23% of their portfolio.

Once a multi-industrial corporation, the company successfully turned itself into a pure-play buildings solutions and technology provider. Catalysts we previously identified for Johnson Controls included synergies following its merger with Tyco International, which provides fire safety and building security products, as well as benefits from its separation of non-building-focused businesses, such as automotive seating and batteries. With all catalysts in sight now nearing completion, and Johnson Controls now a better business for it – with higher recurring revenues and lower capital intensity – we decided to exit our investment to help fund the purchases of Xcel Energy and Atmos Energy.”10. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) offers cloud-based solutions for defining, structuring, administering, and automating enterprise services throughout North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, and other regions. SCGE Management, with 935,100 shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management bought  108,079 more shares of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in Q4. This amount represents a 9% increase over Fisher holdings in ServiceNow relative to the prior three-month period. According to the diversified holding company's 13F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Fisher Asset Management initially took a stake in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in the second quarter of 2014.In the last quarter, the company had 1,637 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract revenue. In addition, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) reported subscription revenue of $1.86 billion, up 22% YoY. RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg boosted his price objective on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $510 from $500 on January 26 and maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares following its Q4 earnings beat. The business produced great software outputs and suggestions in a difficult situation, the analyst claimed in a research report.Polen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”9. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a bank and financial holding corporation that provides banking and nonbank financial services. Bank of America has a 'Moderate Buy' consensus rating based on 7 buy recommendations, 5 hold ratings, and 2 sell ratings.In Q4 of 2022, Fisher Asset Management ramped its stake in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock by 9%.

Furthermore, the bank's net interest income increased by 29% yearly in the fourth quarter. Legendary investor and billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), as of the end of the fourth quarter. Here is what Ariel Investment said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“We initiated three new positions in the quarter. We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 10%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the world's largest provider of CRM software and one of the stocks in which Fisher Asset Management has increased its holdings.

(NYSE:CRM).On February 15, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow boosted his price objective on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) from $180 to $195 while maintaining an ‘Overweight’ rating on the stock. According to the analyst, finding interesting stories in software for Q4 earnings would be challenging.Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”7. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 11%Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is a significant household and personal care product manufacturer.

The fund owns more than 5.46 million shares of stock, which are worth $275.06 billion.Here is what Fundsmith said about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) in its 2022 yearly investor letter:“Last year I wrote about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) and attracted a virtual tsunami of comment for my remarks about Unilever, purpose and Hellmann’s mayonnaise. Events soon overtook this commentary insofar as Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners announced that it had bought a stake in Unilever and he was invited to join the board. We are asked to suspend disbelief that this was in no way linked to the subsequent announcement that Alan Jope will be leaving the CEO role. This explanation sounds like it was lifted from the script of Miracle on 34th Street.…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 17%Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) provides advanced semiconductor wafer manufacturing equipment and services globally.

298,6a439c14-ccbd-3c48-a52b-ac5dcafb0f95,DIS,2023-03-01,DeSantis taking a 'victory lap' over bill that does not 'substantively' do much to Disney: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/desantis-taking-victory-lap-over-160204857.html,1677600124,VIDEO,['DIS'],"[On Monday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that gives him more control over Disney's (DIS) self-controlling zone, known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The bill allows DeSantis to create a state-appointed board to oversee the district. Needham and Company senior media and entertainment analyst Laura Martin DeSantis says she does not see this having much impact on how Disney runs its parks in the near term, saying DeSantis is ""taking a victory lap for, actually, not very much substantively.""Click here to see Martin's full interview with Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Jared Blikre. Key moments:0:10 He's doing this because Disney is too woke0:17 In a content company, you actually can't find employees unless you are woke. So, you just don't have a business unless you have woke employees that create content0:50 They pick up billion dollars a year of costs for the roads and all this stuff, all that would transfer to the communities locally1:10 So he's basically taking a victory lap for actually not very much substantively1:22 In theory, it makes them get, more approvals from local governments to build the next hotel, but their next hotel brings employment.1:44 I do not think this would have happened if the CEO had had a different guy in the seat when this legislation that's the big fight over was happeningVideo TranscriptLAURA MARTIN: OK, so two things. Philosophically, I think DeSantis is making a run at the presidency. And I think a lot of people who don't really understand the issue very well, a lot of Republicans, he's doing this because Disney is too woke. And Disney has 75,000 employees in Florida, and it is the largest employer.And by the way, in a content company, you actually can't find employees unless you are woke. So you just don't have a business unless you have woke employees that create content and are in the parks doing service. So I'm not sure Disney has a choice. I also think it's on the right side of history, is my opinion. But DeSantis is running for president. In two years, my opinion is, he'll be gone because I think it's-- you know, he just will be out of this seat. And then we'll see.Story continuesThe problem with him taking away these-- which he didn't really do actually, but, you know, there's a billion dollars debt on that Disney-- that's Disney's. And they pick up a billion dollars a year of costs for the roads and all this stuff. All that would transfer to the communities locally that house the Walt Disney, if they actually took away their benefits. So he's doing it in name, but there's a lot of liabilities that would get put onto the Florida state budget if he actually did it. So he's basically taking a victory lap for actually not very much substantively.SEANA SMITH: So, Laura, you don't see this at all complicating how Disney runs its parks, at least in the near term?LAURA MARTIN: I do not. Mm-mm, I do not. I mean, in theory, it makes them get more approvals from local governments to build the next hotel. But their next hotel brings employment. So what local government in Florida says, no, we don't want you to build it that way, we want you to build it this way? So no, I don't think so. I actually think nothing happens to Disney. And by the way, we have a much kinder, gentler CEO here, who I do not think this would have happened if the CEO had had a different guy in the seat when this legislation that's the big fight over was happening.]"

NRIM has announced that its board of directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of 60 cents per share. This represents a jump of 20% from its prior payout.The dividend will be paid out on Mar 17 to shareholders of record as on Mar 9. Prior to this, the company had hiked its dividend in August 2022 by 22% to 50 cents. In fact, NRIM has increased its dividend 11 times in the last five years.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $2.40 per share. This results in an annualized dividend yield of 4.57%, considering Northrim’s last day’s closing price of $52.50. The yield is impressive compared with the industry average of 2.36%. The yield is not only attractive for investors but also represents a steady income stream.Apart from regular dividend payouts, NRIM has been rewarding shareholders with a share repurchase program. This January, an expansion of its share repurchase program was approved, under which the company was authorized to buy back up to 285,000 shares. Since the inception of the stock buyback plan, it has repurchased more than 2.05 million shares.The company has a strong balance sheet position, with no debt as of Dec 31, 2022. Thus, NRIM’s efforts to boost shareholder value seem sustainable on the back of solid earnings strength.Through its strong cash-generation capabilities, the company is not only rewarding shareholders but also retaining sufficient capital for growing organically. A rise in core loan balance, higher fee and interest income and increasing interest rates will support Northrim’s financials.Over the past year, shares of NRIM have rallied 20.3% against the industry’s fall of 23.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNorthrim currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Banks Taking Similar ActionsOver the past week, BankUnited, Inc.

With a robust AI-driven network, UniMAP is on the road to consolidate and optimize their campus network capabilities, empowering the future engineers who will drive Malaysia’s digital future.In support of Malaysia's ambitions to grow its digital economy, which is expected to contribute 25.5% of its GDP by 2025, the government launched the MyDIGITAL roadmap, with one of its key thrusts being the development of agile and competent digital talent. Since its establishment in 2002, UniMAP has grown to become one of Malaysia's only four technical universities, committed to producing highly skilled engineers to support the country's economy.UniMAP embarked on a journey last year to transform its campus networking infrastructure to support its transition to a digital learning environment and keep up with the increased usage of its Learning Management System, which now has 17,000 cumulative users per week. Juniper’s proven track record of delivering a wide range of networking needs with the university in the past, as well as its recognition as a Leader in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure, were critical factors in the vendor selection process.A combination of Juniper’s AP33 and AP32 Wireless Access Points were deployed across the campus in conjunction with Juniper Mist Wi-Fi Assurance, streamlining network management and enhancing the experience of the school’s IT team and students. To underpin this connectivity, Juniper EX4650 Ethernet Switches and Juniper Mist Wired Assurance were selected, providing the school with a unified wired and wireless experience driven by Mist AI that delivers simple, secure, and more reliable connectivity at scale. UniMAP has also implemented Juniper’s Marvis Virtual Network Assistant, which leverages AI to help the school's IT team to unify network management and streamline service monitoring and troubleshooting.Story continuesThe university’s data center was upgraded with Juniper’s QFX 10002 and QFX 5120 switches in virtual chassis configuration. This setup has reduced the data center network’s latency to microseconds while also providing a 100GbE connection. Students and faculty will now have access seamless and ultra-fast access to the university’s expanding applications and databases, which is critical to providing the best learning experiences.With an AI-driven network powered by Juniper, UniMAP has been able to continuously improve campus experiences for Malaysia’s next generation of engineers through a data-driven digital campus that is fully connected, accessible and more secure. All of this is done while furthering the university’s mission of being internationally competitive and producing exemplary individuals who contribute to the nation’s digital economy aspirations and overall development.Supporting Quotes:""We recognize the importance of simplifying otherwise complex operational processes at the network level, especially as higher education institutions like UniMAP increase their capabilities at scale to enable a better learning experience digitally. We are delighted to be part of UniMAP’s digital transformation journey, expanding on their existing capabilities to facilitate a seamless connected experience for everyone on campus. With our experience-first solutions, we are confident to support UniMAP in their mission to create an environment in which their students can learn and thrive, without interruption.""- Perry Sui, Senior Director, ASEAN &amp; Taiwan, Juniper Networks""Our goal at UniMAP has always been the same: to ensure that the learning and teaching experiences of both our students and staff are as smooth as possible. We recognize that accessibility to information is the key to shaping the minds of our future graduates. Juniper Networks has been consistently reliable in enabling us to facilitate the development of a digital-first campus, and we look forward to optimizing all the capabilities of their solutions as the nation continues its march towards a truly digital society.""- Nasrudin Abd Shukor, Director, Digital Management and Development Centre (DMDC), UniMAPAdditional Resources:Case Study: Smart Network Elevates Learning Experience at Universiti Malaysia PerlisBlog: When it Comes to Wired &amp; Wireless Access, Juniper Mist is in the Driver’s SeatProduct &amp; Solution Pages:Juniper Networks Wireless Access Points &amp; EdgeJuniper Networks Mist AI and CloudJuniper Networks Marvis Virtual Network AssistantJuniper Networks EX SwitchesJuniper Networks QFX Series SwitchesFollow Juniper Networks online: Facebook | Twitter | LinkedInJuniper Blogs and Community: J-NetAbout Juniper NetworksJuniper Networks is dedicated to dramatically simplifying network operations and driving superior experiences for end users.

I would now like to hand the conference over to Andrea Daley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Andrea DaleyThank you, Carmen, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me for today's call is Simon Campion, Dentsply Sirona, Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Coleman, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that an earnings press release and slide presentation related to the call are available in the Investors section of our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today's call, we may make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about future performance and financial results. We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations on future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recently filed Form 10-K and any updating information in subsequent SEC filings lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.Additionally, on today's call, our remarks will be based on non-GAAP financial results. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Please refer to our press release for the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results.And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Simon.Story continuesSimon D. CampionThank you, Andrea, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our Q4 2022 earnings call. Today, I'll start by providing an overview of our recent performance and the transformation work we have underway. Glenn will cover Q4 and 2022 financial results and also share our 2023 outlook, and then I will finish by providing a strategic operating update.Starting on Slide 5. We were pleased to close out 2022 with results much better than expected, exceeding the high end of our prior outlook across key financial metrics. Having led this organization for 5 months now, I'm energized by the momentum we have and confident that while the macro environment remains challenging, the difficult work we are doing now will aid our ability to navigate it successfully. We are already seeing the fruits of our efforts with early quick wins such as renewed interest from and with DSOs. While we can't get into the details, it gives us confidence in the progress that we are already making.You may have heard that we recently announced our organizational restructuring plan to improve operational performance to increase alignment to drive process and discipline and to begin to position Dentsply Sirona for improved future performance. We committed to act with urgency, and I feel we are doing just that. We are moving deliberately from discovery to action, and we are confident that this plan and other initiatives will collectively improve performance to deliver long-term shareholder value.Moving to Slide 6. Let me take a few minutes to explain the changes we are making. We are putting into place a new operating model, which will enable the company to better deliver on our strategic objectives while also focusing on our tone at the top that focuses on inclusivity, transparency and importantly, ethics and compliance. The plan consists of the following elements: number one, reducing the global workforce by approximately 8% to 10% while continuing to invest in the global commercial organizations. Number two, implementation of 5 global business units reporting into 1 leader, the global business unit as designed to drive enterprise integration align our product portfolio to the company's growth strategy and to drive seamless communication with our commercial teams. Number three, commencement of central functions and infrastructure optimization to support the efficiency of the overall organization. Number four, hiring a new leader of quality and regulatory to fit on the leadership team, thus elevating the visibility and importance of this critical function within the organization. Number five, simplification of management structure to bring the company in line with industry best practices; and number six, delivering cost savings to fund critical investments in 2023 and beyond to position the company for sustainable future growth.As summarized on Slide 7, we expect to achieve at least $200 million in annual cost savings over the next 18 months. And as outlined already, reduced the global workforce by up to 10% of the total employee base but we are not targeting our sales teams. We believe that this plan, along with other actions we have underway will set Dentsply Sirona on the right path to deliver better and more consistent results and, in turn, create significant value for all our stakeholders. The members of the leadership team have undertaken such work in their respective paths. So this experience, coupled with the partnership of external firms who bring an independent view, industry benchmarking and best practice is benefiting this work.This transformational work is particularly difficult when actions impact our team, and therefore, we have not taken these decisions lightly. We have very talented employees and the leadership team is confident that the changes we are making will unite to the organization, would better position Dentsply Sirona for long-term sustainable success. Importantly, we are becoming a more inclusive organization focused on creating and fostering a culture of authenticity, compliance and accountability. This starts with having leaders at the top who will provide the right tone and foster the right culture and I feel that this change in tone within the organization is beginning to resonate with our employees. The most recent North American sales force engagement survey, for example, highlights meaningful arguably significant improvement across the board.In addition to the positive employee momentum, we're also seeing it with our customers globally by leveraging the strength of our clinical education programs. We recently hosted our first-ever DS World Dubai with more than 800 registered attendees from 47 countries. This was our fourth DS World event in the last 6 months and enables us to interact with more than 7,000 dental professionals. Before I turn it over to Glenn to discuss the financial performance, let me reiterate that we want to be a company that fulfills our commitments internally and externally. And I feel that the increased engagement we are seeing internally and externally is helping us establish a pathway to be that company. Glenn?Glenn G. ColemanThank you, Simon. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I'll cover several topics, including our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results as well as our outlook for 2023. Overall, we exceeded the high end of our revenue, operating margin and adjusted EPS outlook ranges that we provided in November and believe this is an important early milestone as we move forward. So let's begin on Slide 9. Our fourth quarter revenue was $983 million, which represented a decline of 10.9% on a reported basis versus the prior year, largely impacted by foreign currency and a stronger U.S. dollar. Organic sales decreased by 2.6%, but if exclude China, sales grew 0.4%. Sequentially, organic revenue grew 5.8% versus Q3. Operating income was $154 million with operating margin of 15.7%. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin contracted due to continued FX and inflation headwinds, partially offset by price.On a sequential basis versus the third quarter, operating margin improved by 100 basis points, which was much better than expected. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.46 and exceeded the high end of our outlook range by $0.09, largely due to better-than-expected organic revenues and operating margin performance. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted EPS declined by $0.37. We attribute about $0.10 of the EPS decline to foreign currency, with the remainder coming from lower year-over-year organic revenues, inflationary pressures and below-the-line FX expenses. We also delivered strong operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, which came in at $142 million, translating to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 110%, up from 100% conversion in the prior year. In the quarter, we returned $26 million to shareholders through dividends.Let me now turn to our segment performance in the quarter on Slide 10. Organic sales in Technologies &amp; Equipment or our T&amp;E segment declined 2.2% while the consumables segment declined 3.4%. The T&amp;E organic sales decline was primarily due to softer implants volume, partially offset by continued strong demand for aligners. Aligners grew over 25% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong growth in both SureSmile and Byte. This quarter was the second quarter in a row with double-digit growth in this part of our business. SureSmile continues to benefit from regional expansion, particularly in Europe and new product offerings. Our direct-to-consumer aligner brand, Byte also saw a very strong growth despite slowing consumer spending trends as we're seeing improvement in customer conversion rates. Our CAD/CAM business also returned to growth in Q4, driven by strong demand in Japan and Korea.The Equipment &amp; Instruments business declined by low single digits in the quarter, driven by softening demand and ongoing supply chain constraints. Implants were down double digits versus the prior year quarter due to softer demand in China as well as in the U.S. and Europe. We did see some positives in parts of our implants business as value implants showed year-over-year growth. Moving to the consumables segment. Organic sales declined primarily due to lower volume in China. These headwinds were partially offset by modest price increases and recent product launches, including ProTaper Ultimate and CEREC blocks and growth in restorative and preventative products. Excluding China, the Consumables segment grew approximately 1% organically over the prior year fourth quarter.Now let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss fourth quarter financial performance by region. U.S. sales were $369 million, representing an organic sales decline of 1.7%, driven by lower volume in CAD/CAM, implants and lab consumables. These headwinds were partially offset by strong growth in aligners. While CAD/CAM volume was down in the quarter, dealer inventory levels were also reduced by $30 million sequentially. Turning to Europe. Sales of $376 million were down 3.2% on an organic basis due to lower implants and equipment volume. We attribute the softness in equipment to continued supply constraints as well as a weaker retail demand environment. Rest of World sales were $238 million and down 3% on an organic basis versus the prior year. In China, as expected, we experienced lower sales across product groups due to COVID shutdowns as well as headwinds in implants due to the impact of VBP. Excluding China, Rest of World organic sales had a very strong quarter and grew double digits.Moving to Slide 12, let me now cover our full year 2022 performance. In 2022, sales were $3.9 billion, representing an organic sales decline of 0.5%. Sales in the year were significantly impacted by foreign currency headwinds, supply chain constraints and regional softness in China and the U.S., with the U.S. decline largely due to reductions in CAD/CAM dealer inventory. Despite these headwinds, we are pleased by our performance in Europe, which grew 3% on an organic basis and Rest of World, excluding China, which grew 10%. Notably, our global aligners business, which is a key growth area for the company grew nearly 10% over the prior year. Operating margin for the full year was 16.8%, which exceeded our outlook of margin greater than 15%. As compared to full year 2021, operating margin contracted 350 basis points due to lower volume, unfavorable mix, inflation and foreign exchange headwinds, which was partially offset by price. For the full year, foreign exchange headwinds impacted operating margin by 100 basis points. We delivered full year EPS of $2.09 or $2.44 excluding the impact of FX compared to $2.82 in the prior year. The company continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and finished the year with $365 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.1x. For the year, we returned approximately 70% of free cash flow to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases. And today, we announced a 12% increase to our dividend. This represents 3 consecutive years of double-digit increases to the dividend and signifies our confidence in our long-term plans.With that, let's now move to Slide 14 to discuss our expectations for 2023. Overall, we're reviewing 2023 as a transition year. Significant work is underway to improve the company and fix the internal issues, structure and processes that have hindered recent results, and this work will position the company to drive significant shareholder value when the external environment improves. With that said, we have a credible plan for 2023 that includes cost savings and much needed investments to create and sustain long-term profitable growth in the business. For the full year 2023, we expect organic sales to be in the range of down 1% to up 2% which represents a net sales range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. Based on current rates, FX will be a 100 basis point headwind to full year net sales. On an FX-neutral basis, we expect the cadence of sales to be fairly balanced over the year with sales slightly larger in the second half of the year as compared to the first half.We anticipate that demand will remain strong in key strategic growth areas. Aligners will continue to benefit from regional expansion and market share gains, and we expect better performance in implants. We also anticipate an uplift from our recently launched CAD/CAM products, including Primeprint, DS Core and Primescan Connect, but we remain cautious on overall equipment demand.Turning to regional dynamics. We expect to see an improvement in the 2 geographies that were a challenge in 2022, the U.S. and China. In Q4, we made critical investments to our U.S. commercial team which will continue in the first half of 2023. We also enhanced our commission plans to incentivize growth and address the higher CAD/CAM dealer inventory levels. We expect that these actions will enable our U.S. business to return to growth in 2023, starting in the first quarter.In China, we expect sales will be flat on an organic basis after a year of significant decline in 2022, but we remain cautious on the demand outlook as significant near-term uncertainty remains. Additionally, VBP will be a top line headwind due to the 40% price impact we will see in our China implants business. While many uncertainties remain, we are seeing positive signs of recovery. For example, this week, our China commercial team participated in an in-person dental trade show with 50,000 dental professionals in attendance. As we move forward in 2023, we'll be using EBITDA margin as the primary profitability measure to track our operational performance and better align with our peers. For 2023, we expect our EBITDA margin to be greater than 18% which is a decline of 140 basis points from the prior year, but above our fourth quarter run rate of 17.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 on a full year basis.Let's turn to Slide 15 to discuss the puts and takes in our 2023 EPS outlook. Overall, we anticipate that adjusted EPS will decline from $2.09 in 2022 to $1.90 in 2023 at the midpoint of our outlook range. Cost savings from the restructuring plan are expected to accelerate starting in the second quarter, contributing approximately $0.30 of EPS in 2023 with the full run rate achieved by mid-2024. We anticipate a sequential moderation in raw material inflation throughout 2023, but remain at elevated levels. We will offset a portion of the inflation with price increases, which will net to a $0.20 headwind to earnings. Other items namely FX and interest will net to a $0.04 headwind to EPS. This brings us to EPS of $2.15, up $0.06 versus the prior year, excluding the impact of investments. We will be making commercial investments and undertaking long overdue integration activities in 2023. These investments are expected to impact EPS by $0.25.On Slide 16, we'll cover the risks and opportunities we see in our outlook. Our outlook is based on our most recent view of the dental market and economy today. Overall, we see 2023 as having a healthy balance of risks and opportunities that could enable outperformance. The largest variable to our outlook is the overall health of the economy. Similar to last year, the external environment remains challenging and uncertainty is high. While demand has been largely stable to date, we believe that recessionary concerns, rising interest rates and high inflation could lead to a change in consumer behavior, which in turn could cause a slowdown in elective procedures and capital equipment purchases. Beyond the external environment, key opportunities that could drive our performance relative to our outlook include earlier or greater impact from commercial investments and faster sustained supply chain recovery. On the risk side, we acknowledge there is some risk to the timing on realizing savings associated with our organizational restructuring plan. It is a large-scale global program with many variables which we're closely monitoring as we execute.Turning to Slide 17. We've laid out additional details on our expectations for the first quarter given the visibility that we have at this stage in the quarter. For the first quarter, we expect year-over-year organic sales growth to be approximately 1%, driven by continued strong growth in our aligners business and growth in the U.S. offset by continued headwinds in China, which we expect to gradually improve over the remainder of the year. U.S. organic growth will benefit from easier comps in CAD/CAM and the favorable timing of dealer orders. Entering the year, dealer inventory has returned to much lower levels and will be largely aligned to retail sales going forward. Having said that, we do expect dealer CAD/CAM inventory to increase sequentially in Q1 and then return to lower levels over the course of the year. We expect the U.S. quarterly performance to be choppy in 2023 with slight growth for the full year. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we anticipate that FX will continue to be a headwind, negatively impacting net sales in the first quarter by approximately $40 million. We expect EBITDA margins will be at least 15% and will sequentially improve each quarter as the realization of the restructuring plan savings accelerate and we begin to see demand recovery in certain regions.Let me now wrap up on Slide 18 and quickly touch on capital allocation priorities. We plan to continue returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends, which we've increased 3 consecutive years as well as share repurchases. Our capital deployment strategy is predicated on keeping leverage low with flexibility in the balance sheet while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. We have a strong balance sheet, a low leverage ratio and healthy cash flow generation and expect full year 2023 free cash flow conversion of approximately 80% which reflects the expected cash outlays to support our restructuring program. Our goal is to improve conversion to 100% once you move past the onetime cash outlays in 2023 through the organization and portfolio work that we discussed today as well as working capital and supply chain optimization.And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Simon.Simon D. CampionThank you, Glenn. Moving on to our strategic update, starting on Slide 20. We are putting our plans into motion as we move the organization forward to address the internal challenges we have faced and lay the right foundation that will enable long-term sustainable performance. The fundamentals of our industry remain attractive, and we are well placed to capitalize on growth opportunities supported by a solid organizational foundation. Our path forward starts with confirmation that our strategy to transform the industry by digitalizing dental workflows by driving product and service innovation and delivering an exceptional customer and patient experience through an engaged and diverse workforce is the right one. We are now intensely focused on how we will improve on the delivery of the tactical elements of this strategy in a predictable, repeatable, reliable manner to customers, shareholders and employees.Changing to Slide 21, we have initiated much of this transformational work with heavy lifting is ahead of us. As we embark on this new year, we are focused on 5 core tactical and strategic objectives. These objectives are to: number one, deliver on our annual growth and margin commitments that Glenn has just shared. Number two, enhance and sustain our profitability. Number three, accelerate enterprise digitalization. Number four, win in aligners and implants. And number five, create a high-performance culture. As we make progress on these objectives, we do so with an eye on fulfilling our commitment to return to industry growth and increase profitability.Turning to Slide 22. I would like to reiterate the key actions we are taking to achieve these objectives. Today, we have provided our 2023 growth and margin outlook, and we are committed to achieving that plan. We will do so by making meaningful progress on the other 4 objectives that we have laid out. Notably, we have discussed in detail the organizational changes we have underway to implement a new operating model which will enable us to connect segments and geographies, reallocate capital through the company as needed and eliminate silos to improve the customer and employee experience. In parallel, we are defining our winning portfolio. The strategic intent of our winning portfolio will focus on a simple, secure and connected workflow experience that our dental clinic and lab customers trust for better treatment journeys and patient outcomes.Related to our portfolio shaping work, a topic of much discussion has been the future of our Wellspect HealthCare business. I can confirm that while no final decisions about the ultimate status of the significant and profitable portfolio have been made, we have received several inbound inquiries about this asset. We feel compelled to investigate such inquiries and have commenced engagements with several interested parties. We will not make any further comments on this matter until we have a definitive conclusion to these discussions. Another key aspect of our winning portfolio involves simplification. We are reviewing the company's product offerings on a SKU level basis to inform the size of actions that can be taken to streamline the portfolio and deliver higher returns. Our early insights indicate that the portfolio is overly complex. For example, we now know that in our consumables business, 12% of the SKUs generate approximately 95% of our revenue in those categories. This complexity adds significant costs to the business and leads to inefficient use of internal resources across functions. Specifically, in Endo, we have over 9,000 SKUs of different endodontic files with 8% of the SKUs making up 90% of that platform's revenue.While this work is ongoing, we know there is opportunity to simplify and drive improvement in plants and the network efficiencies to unlock further long-term margin expansion. These efforts also yield additional benefits, including reducing operational complexity, optimizing inventory, increasing service levels and sales force effectiveness, reducing risk and improving quality. Importantly, we see these benefits with the goal of preserving the associated revenue through disciplined execution and effective customer partnerships. The comprehensive review of our business has suffered important areas that need strategic investments to drive overdue integration and enable future growth. Key areas for investment include our global sales teams, our IT systems and in resources to ensure compliance. Many of these investments have already commenced, and we have, for example, made great progress on the U.S. sales force expansion. The vast majority are hired and were recently trained in our North America sales meeting.Investments in our IT systems are necessary to modernize our landscape and further our enterprise integration. While these types of large-scale ERP endeavors are typically a multiyear journey requiring large investment, they are critical to the business, operating efficiently and most importantly, being able to deliver for customers in an optimal way. We have commenced the process to understand this transformation over the past number of weeks. Compliance is another critically important area. Investing on compliance will support the remediation plan developed in 2022. Operating with the utmost integrity and in a compliant manner in everything we do, is important to us all on the leadership team and on the Board. As such, this investment has the complete support of both groups and is underway. We are confident that with these actions and in more normalized market conditions, Dentsply Sirona can grow revenue at or above our historical long-term targets while also increasing profitability. The combination of these positive factors in conjunction with the significant structure of our process changes within our organization can enable Dentsply Sirona to deliver the meaningful earnings improvement expected by the end of 2025 with adjusted earnings per share of $3 targeted in 2026.So let me close with a few remarks on Slide 23. We ended 2022 on a positive note by exceeding our prior outlook commitments in the fourth quarter. Importantly, there is a sense of positivity within the commercial teams about the future, driven by the structural changes, our transparency and the commission plan changes. 2023 undoubtedly, will be a transition year as the restructuring plan is put into action against a challenging external environment. However, we are confident in our capability to execute it and attach a clear path forward for the organization, its employees and its investors. We're committed to taking decisive action at Dentsply Sirona, and I believe we are not only taking decisive action but taking the right action to improve the company to improve its performance. We want to capitalize on the opportunity that the dental industry affords an organization like ours and believe that this restructuring enables us to drive internal alignment and accountability, simplified and fund critical growth investments. It is essential to achieving our 5 key objectives and delivering the meaningful earnings improvement that you expect that we expect. We are embarking on this road confidence in our collective experience with the support of the Board and with belief that we can transform this organization.And with that, I will open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS.Dylan Christopher FinleyThis is actually Dylan Finley on for Kevin Caliendo. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. Question for you on the revenue side. So you put out that $3 EPS target for 2026. Based on some math that we did assuming some moderate amount of buybacks and assuming you hit a 20% operating margin, by that time frame, we landed on an average growth rate of around 2.5%. So based on the growth that you're expecting this year, it will definitely accelerate a little bit. I'm wondering if this is consistent with your own internal assumptions and if you have any visibility yet exiting 2023, where you expect to grow?Glenn G. ColemanNo, I think first and foremost, we haven't laid out our revenue expectations long term. We'll do that at an Investor Day coming up in November. But clearly, we would expect to get back to market growth rates over the coming years as part of our plan. And I would say our expectations are to do above the 2.5% to 3% when you look out 2 to 3 years from now. So that would be part of our expectations on how we get to the $3.OperatorIt comes from line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonI guess one longer-term question and one shorter-term question as this is really helpful for the details about some of the strategic investments and initiatives. And I was wondering how you think about the sort of like cadence and time line of how some of these new investments translate into maybe new product launches, et cetera? I know you talked, Simon, about reducing the SKU count, but I imagine you also have sort of continued innovation, as you pointed out with the R&amp;D spend, et cetera. maintain. So I guess that would be my first question. And my second question is just on the shorter-term cadence. We're 2/3 of the way through the first quarter and I was just wondering if you could talk through what you're seeing currently in the market across your major geographies?Simon D. CampionElizabeth, thank you for the questions. So let me start with the R&amp;D piece. One of the benefits, I think, to the reorganization that we're going through has been we're now getting more and more visibility to where and how we've invested our R&amp;D dollars and the returns that we have obtained on those historically. The benefit of moving to one massive global business unit as we will be able to decide seamlessly where we want to spend our R&amp;D dollars and bring more discipline to that process as to how we evaluate the value and monitor progress during the R&amp;D cycle and even into the commercial cycle. So you should expect to hear more from us certainly at Analyst Day or Investor Day on that. And then with respect to investments, I'll use the U.S. commercial team as an example. As I noted in the prepared remarks, we are well underway, in fact, we're almost complete with that investment on the implant team and on the DSO team. We've already experienced traction, as I noted, with the DSOs in relation to the implants, it's a very clinical [cell]. And so we would expect a tail on their training before they begin to deliver meaningful performance in the implant arena in the U.S. But clearly, it's an area where we have control of our own destiny, we were direct sales force. It's profitable and it's growing. And we think we have a portfolio that we can win with in that space. So we would expect increasing performance over the year and into next year from the implant team.Glenn G. ColemanAnd Elizabeth, on your question around Q1. Obviously, we're 2 months now into the quarter. I would say, first and foremost, we're much more positive around Q1 than where we were just a few months ago. So the fact that we're talking about putting up organic growth in Q1, I think, is a positive. We do expect to see really strong growth coming out of the Ortho portfolio. January was a record month for SureSmile, which was a pleasant surprise for us. So that momentum is continuing. CAD/CAM should also have a very strong quarter given where we are with the dealer inventory levels in the U.S. along with the success we're seeing with Primeprint.So on the whole, we're looking at Q1 more positively than we were, say, a few months ago with growth coming from Ortho and CAD/CAM. Obviously, we're still seeing headwinds in China. So we are modeling a pretty sizable decline in China in Q1, but that should improve after we get past Q1. So that's the Q1 story. FX will be a pretty large headwind still in Q1. We modeled out right now $40 million based upon where rates are currently. On a full year basis, we expect organic growth to be down 1% to up 2% organically. Again, about a full point on the top line relative to the FX headwind and EPS of $1.82. I would just say, the way we've modeled our full year outlook is expecting a stable environment, patient volumes to be stable. Regionally, we've made a number of comments in our prepared remarks around improvements we're expecting in both China and the U.S., which have been big challenges for us in 2022. So U.S. should be up on a full year basis slightly, China flat coming off of a quarter that's going to be down in Q1. And then Europe should be flat to maybe down slightly and then growth coming out of Rest of World when you exclude China and Latin America.So on a whole, that's how we see the regions playing out. And again, if you look at the portfolio, aligner should show really good growth year-over-year, implants should be improving and CAD/CAM should be growing. So on the whole, that's how we've laid out our outlook. I would just say an important point I made, and I wanted to ensure that everyone heard it is when we look at our top line, we expect on a constant currency basis that the second half of the year will be slightly higher than the first half, which means the year is not back-end loaded in terms of the top line. However, for EPS, keep in mind, our restructuring savings will not kick in until probably the latter half of the second quarter, which means EPS will be back-end loaded. And I would just say directionally [I'd bottle] about 40% of our full year EPS in the first half of the year and 60% in the back half of the year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color around Q1 and our full year outlook.OperatorIt comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.Brandon CouillardSimon, on the '25, '26 target of $3 EPS. Just help us understand how you got comfortable putting that target out there today, especially right in front of a pretty major restructuring program.Simon D. CampionYes. Brandon, I would say that, again, we alluded to it in our prepared remarks, between the restructuring and a lot of other activities that we have underway including the SKU rationalization and driving plans and network efficiency, we got comfortable with that projection pretty quickly. In fact, we -- I think we put that out at the JPMorgan meeting in January. And we have confidence that we're going to achieve it with all the levers that quite frankly, we do have our disposal to get to it. Glenn, I don't know if you have any further comments.Glenn G. ColemanNo, I think the cost side of the equation, you've already seen the actions that we're putting in place to drive us towards that $3 EPS number. We'll give more color around the SKU work and the impact of that when we get to November, but we have a good quantification of what we think that looks like, including the facility optimization piece. I think a key part of this, though, is getting back to market growth. So we're going to need see a more normalized macro environment, coupled with new product launches and innovation. And again, we feel confident over the next 3 to 4 years, we'll get back to market growth, coupled with the cost actions that we're taking will drive to a number that's north of $3 by 2026.Brandon CouillardExcellent. And Glenn, in terms of the full year organic growth guide, can you give us any more color between the subsegments, T&amp;E versus consumables and what does that intend for net pricing capture for the year?Glenn G. ColemanYes. So I think in terms of pricing, the way you laid it out is low single-digit increases. I think it's important to note, though, that we're being very surgical around where we're increasing pricing. So we're not just doing it across the board, we're doing it in certain regions and certain parts of the portfolio. And that's a net number. So obviously, we're discounting and actually reducing prices in some cases, China being one as an example and also other parts of the portfolio. So on the whole, we're counting on low single-digit price tailwinds as we go into 2023. Keep in mind, we rolled out 2 price increases in 2022, so we'll get the full year benefit of that. And we have 1 plan for 2023 at the moment. So that's how we see pricing. I'm not going to give you the specifics between T&amp;E and consumables, but obviously, we've been very thoughtful in terms of how we thought about price increases. Thanks for the question.OperatorIt comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.Nathan Allen RichI had a few on the CAD/CAM segment. Can you give a little bit more detail on what drove the growth in CAD/CAM in Q4 given the relative size of the U.S. and the tough comps there, surprised that it was up, so definitely good performance. Just curious what drove that in the quarter. On the inventory changes, could you maybe talk about what you're hearing from the distributors on why there's the volatility in inventory levels? And you said you expect CAD/CAM to return to growth in 2023, is that growth excluding the dealer restocking that you expect to benefit Q1?Glenn G. ColemanSo our performance for CAD/CAM in Q4 is almost all driven by Asia Pac. We saw really strong performance in Japan and Korea as an example. So regionally, that's where the growth came from. Obviously, we continue to see some progress in other parts of the world, but that's the primary driver of growth here in the fourth quarter. On the inventory changes, I think, first and foremost, we did a really nice job to take down the inventory levels throughout 2022. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were down $30 million sequentially from Q3 to Q4. On a full year basis, we were down over $60 million. So we're actually below the levels we started the year, which is very good, which means for every retail dollar of sales, we should see a wholesale dollar sale, which we didn't see in 2022.So as we move forward now, obviously, we should see better performance in CAD/CAM in the U.S. And we're still cautious around the U.S. equipment market and speaking with our dealers and seeing what's happening in the marketplace, we're still cautious. So I think the fact we've got our dealer inventory levels where they are, being a bit cautious is how we've laid out our guidance for 2023. But keep in mind, we do have some new products that we've launched in the space. We are expecting to see growth overall. And so that's how we've laid out 2023. Simon, did you want to add anything?Simon D. CampionI think you covered that. Nathan, we had a strong quarter. We've got global execution and with our renewed focus on the U.S., we're comfortable where we're at.OperatorIt comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with RW Baird. All right. We have technical issues with his line. Can I move to the next question, please.Andrea DaleyDo we have the next question?OperatorYes, ma'am, it comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.Erin Elizabeth Wilson WrightGreat. So on the restructuring initiative, I think you alluded to SKU count rationalization, does that have a meaningful impact on sales? And is this something that is embedded in your guidance both in the near-term and longer-term perspective? And will this be something you're breaking out for us, how should we be thinking about the timing and magnitude of that? And then just on divestitures, other areas of potential divestitures outside of medical, I understand that you're limited on what you can say on that front. But also any details you can give us on the margin profile of the Wellspect business, that would be great.Simon D. CampionThank you for the question. So on the SKUs, we don't expect to execute any meaningful work on the SKU rationalization in 2023. The organization ran a SKU program a few years ago. And I think we offset some customers and we offset some of our distribution partners. So we're going through this in a very thoughtful manner. And so we don't expect any changes this year, but the plans will be laid out this year, and you should expect to hear some more granularity at the Investor Day in November about that. We provided some color in the prepared remarks about the scale of some of the SKU offerings we have and their contribution to revenue. So hopefully, that provided you some additional color around there.With regard to the divestitures, we obviously considered other parts of our business, too. But they are more consistent with our thoughts around being a dental developer and manufacturer and commercial team. So while we looked at a number of different opportunities to rationalize our portfolio, the one that we have received several inbounds about and that we're taking along close look at right now is the Wellspect HealthCare portfolio, and there are no plans to do any further ones. And then, Glenn?Glenn G. ColemanYes, I would just add just to answer your question on the profitability of the Wellspect business, it is accretive to our overall corporate average.OperatorIt comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with RW Baird.Jeffrey D. JohnsonGlenn, maybe I can follow up just on that margin accretive comment on Wellspect. We get the EPS contribution annually maybe around $0.20 or so or at least in the ballpark there. And I just want to confirm that Wellspect is in guidance in keeping that for the full year as part of the current guidance. And I guess one other question tied to that is, if you were to get a big cash infusion, whether it was for this reason or any other reason, does that go to pay down debt? Does it go as a share buyback? Or do you pump that right back into maybe potentially other acquisitions to drive that top line and kind of the dental portfolio going forward?Glenn G. ColemanJeff, thanks for the questions. First and foremost, I would say yes, Wellspect is included full year in our numbers. And again, we're just at this point, evaluating our options around that business. So that business is included in our full year expectations. Obviously, if the business were to be divested, we'd have to think about what to do with those cash proceeds. We're already very low levered. So that's good news relative to what we could potentially do. But at this point in time, we're not going to lay out any specific plans other than we would make the most appropriate decisions around how to offset any EPS dilution relative to the transaction.Jeffrey D. JohnsonAnd then maybe one follow-up question, if I can. Just you talked about adding to the sales force here in a few different areas and trying to increase the commercial [health] there. I could pick on, I guess, or pick out a couple of different areas, whether it's within equipment or orthodontics or implants, but I'll try to narrow it down just the implants here. You're a #5 player in implants, probably under-indexed, although you could push back on that kind of under-indexed in value implants are under-indexed and fully tapered implants, which those are the 2 kind of bigger growth areas recently. So if you add sales reps, I get it, but what are you doing on the product side to really if implants is one of to the turnaround here? How do you end up winning in implants, Simon, as you talked about here recently.Simon D. CampionYes. Jeff, just a couple of points on that. I think historically, our focus on paying for growth hasn't been what we would have liked, so our commission plan changes -- our commission plans have changed to more reflect that we want to drive growth from our commercial teams. So we're certainly getting a lot more visibility from them to different parts of our portfolio. And the feedback we've received thus far on those commission plan changes have been having very positive. People want to get paid when they perform. So we do expect that.In relation to our portfolio, as I noted, I think in my response to Elizabeth's question, we are now getting visibility. We now have visibility to where we spend our dollars and what returns we get from them. So to your point about implants, it's a fast-growing segment, an opportunity to differentiate ourselves where we have a sales force that is direct, then we would more likely invest in spaces like that than elsewhere. But you need to make sure is that we get -- develop products that are meaningful for our customers. I think we've just launched the -- some of our taper products as well which have resonated with customers up there. So I think we're already doing some of the work that you've alluded to. And we will absolutely be reinforcing our commitment to appropriate the R&amp;D in the appropriate spaces moving forward.OperatorAnd it comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.Thomas M. StephanThis is Tom Stephan on for Jon. I'll start with 2023 guidance. Glenn, maybe this is for you. But how should we be thinking about T&amp;E and consumables organic growth, I guess, relative to the total company guidance of down 1% to up 2% between implants, ortho, it sounds like T&amp;E will be the growth engine. But I think it would be helpful if we could put a finer point on where that may shake out in rough terms, I guess, is each segment within the total company range? Or how should we maybe think about them maybe reaching the high end and low end of it potentially?Glenn G. ColemanTom, thanks for the question. We're not going to give too much specifics on our segment guidance. I would just say we are expecting T&amp;E to grow faster than consumables as part of our guidance range. But that's all we're going to comment on at this point in time.Thomas M. StephanGot it. And then my follow-up is just on the restructuring. Simon, you gave some very helpful color throughout the call. But can you maybe talk a bit more about the current restructuring and how it may be different from the prior ones for the company? I guess, what were the learnings from those that you're trying to apply this time around? And maybe what gives you confidence this won't potentially be more disruptive than expected and maybe ultimately have some sort of impact on growth?Simon D. CampionYes. Thanks for the question. So we've been very thoughtful about this restructuring. You will have hopefully noted that we are not impacting our sales teams at all. In fact, we're net positive on investments in our sales team globally including Europe and the U.S. I think the difference is, we're here, we're being extremely thoughtful about it. We are driving alignment between our RCOs between the regions and the global business units. And we are giving the global business units a single voice. So communications is going to be better between the business units and the regions and decision-making and agility is going to be improved because we have -- we now have more visibility to all of the financial aspects of it and we can move money around as appropriate to fund different investments either commercially or R&amp;D or in other spaces like plant quality and so on and so forth. So I think it's meaningfully different to what was done before.We -- as we noted in the prepared remarks as well, I think the tone at the top is a very material change here as well. And again, in the prepared remarks, we commented on some of the feedback that we've received from the U.S. commercial team, in particular, where some of those metrics have doubled in the past 6 months. So we are changing the tone here at the company, we're being transparent. We're being inclusive. We're driving discipline and improving process and making investments to make this company a better place to work and a better place to deliver results that you expect and that we expect.OperatorIt comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Bank of America.Michael Aaron ChernyI'm going to wrap a bunch of topics, I think, into one here. But as you think about the trajectory and particularly the build into that $3.26 number, I'm not looking for how you think about the revenue dynamics, but how do you think about the mix in terms of your focus on going direct versus not going direct? We heard from one of your key distribution partners yesterday about their desire to build out their own specialty business. And so how does that impact your view of [X-rays] go-to-market strategy and what you can do to take control of more of your own destiny versus rely on your distribution partners as you think about this multiyear build?Simon D. CampionYes. Thanks for the question, Michael. We value the partnership that we have with our distributors. They have different degrees of meaningfulness to our organization in different regions, certainly in the U.S. they're very meaningful, and we have begun to build, I think, constructive relationships with them. But there are certain areas, of course, where we have a direct presence, such as implants and aligners. And we do tend to see great growth from those areas. So while we have constructive and developing relationships with our distributors, it is a unique environment within that -- within dental, where you're partners and competitors at the same time. So we are driving transparency with respect to our thought process with our -- with those distributors in the U.S. in particular.OperatorIt comes from the line of Justin Lin with William Blair.Justin LinYou mentioned you had a record quarter for SureSmile. I guess, in your view, what's driving the success beyond improving macro? And are you more so taking share or expanding the market?Glenn G. ColemanSo it was a record month in January, not quarter. So I just want to be clear, January was a really strong month. But obviously, the momentum around SureSmile continues. We still think it's a very much underpenetrated market. Aesthetics are here to stay. So those are positive dynamics. But for us, SureSmile has fewer revisions from a clinical perspective. We're seeing high customer engagement and geographic expansion, and all of that is leading to market share gains for us. So we had a really robust 2022 year, and we expect that will continue to see good growth, both in SureSmile and Byte in 2023.Justin LinGot you. And I guess that leads me to my next follow-up question, if you may. I guess more longer-term question around your Clear Aligner strategy. How do you make a more meaningful push into the Ortho channel, if that's part of your plan at all with the other portion of the business being sort of direct-to-consumer?Simon D. CampionYes. So Byte has performed very well for us over the past 2 quarters. We've had a lot of questions on Byte and the acquisition since we joined here last September. I think it is synergistic with our SureSmile business. It has performed very well since we've arrived here. We have had great customer satisfaction scores through the My Byte app, which is really resonating with them, and it's performing well. So we see it as a as a meaningful part of our portfolio, one that we're being diligent around expenses on and investing appropriately and driving customer acquisition, customer conversion and trying to increase customer satisfaction scores and drive the web traffic in that manner.Glenn G. ColemanYes, I would just add, I mentioned this in some previous discussions. Obviously, with Ortho doing much better on a top line, a big part of our margin expansion and improvement story is around the bottom line as well. And our ortho businesses are becoming more profitable both in SureSmile and in Byte. So that's also very encouraging relative to how we think about 2024, 2025, getting to higher operating margins, the EBITDA margins, our Ortho business should be a contributor to that and should be a nice tailwind when we go into 2024 for sure.OperatorIt comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan Chase.Rachel Marie Vatnsdal OlsonSo I wanted to follow up on some of the earlier questions around margin and the P&amp;L guidance for the year. So there's a fair amount of moving pieces throughout that P&amp;L given the restructuring. So I appreciate your comments on EPS being [within 40-60] between first half and second half. Can you give us some color on margin cadence throughout the year? Going from that greater than 15% EBITDA margins in 1Q to over [18%] for the year, what should we really expect from a 4Q exit rate? And then I have a follow-up as well.Glenn G. ColemanYes, I don't think we want to provide too much more color on margin performance. I would just say Q1 is expected to be the lowest quarter of the year. We said greater than 15% EBITDA margins. Obviously, that would imply the back half of the year doing north of 20% EBITDA margins with Q4 exiting at the highest rate. So I think that's how we've laid it out overall. And again, for our full year, we expect to be greater than 18% for EBITDA margins. So I think that's all the color we're going to provide at this point.Rachel Marie Vatnsdal OlsonAnd then just a quick follow-up just on supply chain and you're off you guys expect that those constraints continue. So can you just talk about what is assumed from supply chain constraints heading forward throughout 2023?Glenn G. ColemanYes. I think first and foremost, the supply chain constraints really surround electronics and electronic components. It hasn't gotten any worse. It is moving in the right direction, but we still have challenges. What we assumed is things get a little bit better throughout 2023. I did mention in my prepared remarks, one of the upside possibilities we have in 2023 is seeing a better improvement than what we're modeling. So I think I have modeled a pretty conservative view on supply chain and some of the constraints we're dealing with. If it actually is better than our assumptions, it would lead us to a chance to overachieve. So I think we've been pretty conservative in how we've laid that out.OperatorWith that, I will conclude the Q&amp;A session and turn the call back to Simon Campion for final remarks.Simon D. CampionThank you, Carmen. So in closing today, I would like to reiterate my thanks to the entire Dentsply Sirona team, including those employees who've left recently, for their valuable contributions to the organization and their unwavering commitment to our customers. The past year was challenging and the transformational work we have ahead of us will not be easy. However, I am confident that Dentsply Sirona has a bright future ahead. We are already making significant progress, which will benefit all stakeholders over the long term from customers to employees to investors. Thank you for your time today.Glenn G. ColemanThank you all.OperatorThank you. And with that, we thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 biggest public companies in the world.While much maligned, and often rightly so, the biggest public companies in the world aren't just intrinsically linked to economic growth and development, but also to the significant improvement in quality of life that mankind has enjoyed in the last few decades. This is why most countries in the world attempt to provide incentives and tax breaks to companies because of the economic improvements and jobs that such corporations provide.So what is the main difference between a public and a private company? A private company is generally owned by founders, management or private investors. On the other hand, a public company has at least a significant portion of its shares held by the general public, also known as free float. This percentage depends on the regulations of a country but is generally at least 25%, which means that the founders may still control the company even if is listed. When a company starts to grow significantly and needs more capital, it offers its shares to the publics in an initial public offering, or IPO, by getting listed on a stock exchange, and you can easily learn more about the biggest IPOs of all time.25 biggest public companies in the worldPhoto by Campaign Creators on UnsplashBecause a public company's shares are owned by the general public, the regulations that it must follow are much more stringent than for private companies, including publishing annual reports, quarterly reports, any material information updates, ESG and much more. The biggest public companies in the world are worth more than the GDP of most nations worldwide, so you can understand the power and influence that these companies possess.While there are some countries without stock exchanges, most have a stock exchange, or even multiple, with more than 40,000 companies listed globally. Of these, only 10% are located in the U.S., but because of its advanced economy and favorable laws and regulations, the vast majority of the biggest public companies in the world are located there. Overall, Asia has the largest number of listed companies which account for close to 37% of the global market value. Because of the recent appreciation in the U.S. dollar, U.S. companies are more dominant than ever in terms of market capitalization. An interesting statistic according to the Organization of Economically Developed Countries in 2019 was that in half of the global listed companies, just three holders held more than 50% of the capital, showing the concentration of both influence and wealth.Story continuesThe biggest public companies in the world have a total market cap of over $22.5 trillion, more than a fifth of the global GDP in 2021, according to the World Bank. These companies dominate the industries they are in and come from a variety of sectors, though tech companies are present thoroughly throughout the list.

It remains the quieter alternative for cloud business, maybe. It's not so quiet, though. It may not have the flashier margins of its peers, but it could see upside from AI chat bots, even as the industry remains pressured. Let's get to Business Class Brad for more on Oracle's position in the cloud infrastructure landscape.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, thanks so much, Julie. Well, yes, I'm taking a look under the hood here at Oracle this morning. Ticker symbol ORL-- or ORCL. Yes, ORCL, everyone. It's very clear here. All right, so Oracle here, this company has had a big 2023 thus far. Two new firms initiating coverage this year. It's up by about 5% year to date. DA Davidson, they initiated coverage with a neutral. Mizuho initiated with a buy and a $116 price target. Plus, they also caught two upgrades, one from Jefferies, from hold to buy, and one from Piper Sandler, with a neutral to overweight upgrade there.And particularly here, one thing that Mizuho stated within this, ""Investors may be underestimating Oracle's potential over the medium term to generate solid top line and cash flow growth and exceed some of the fiscal 2026 targets of $65 billion in revenue."" Now, they go on. But here's what I want to get into for our SWOT analysis-- the strengths, the weaknesses, the opportunities, and the threats in hitting some of those targets that Mizuho had put out there, as well as the rest of the Street is looking for.So in the strengths category, one thing that I'm looking at here is the cloud. And particularly on the cloud, the infrastructure cloud, this is seen as one of the more superior offerings in the market here. Performance, security, and the reliability as well, is one thing that constantly gets brought up in some of the net promoter types of conversations from customers, and more broadly in comparison to some of the other offerings that are out there on the Street.Story continuesNow, this was evident, of course. You look through some of the earnings that have come out most recently, past quarter here, cloud revenue, that was up by about 48% here. And even if you strip out Cerner, it still came in up by about 27% for the total cloud revenue growth there. So that a net positive or a strength here for Oracle.However, one of the weaknesses is, in this competitive landscape, pricing strategy is one thing that Oracle is going to have to get right. And when you think about that pricing strategy and going up against the other players in this cloud space, that could impact their gross profit margins. Now, they hit 76.1%, and that was the last 12 month figure. That was down, though, from 80%. You think about that a couple of years ago is where that stood. And so that is going to be one area to keep a close eye on here in the near term and moving forward. We'll see what the company says on that when they do report earnings. Early to mid-March is when those results will be coming out.However, one of the opportunities here-- and you may have gleaned some insights just a couple of weeks ago, just a week ago, when Nvidia reported earnings. They came up in that call because I think about AI, artificial intelligence, sure, it's a buzz word. But in the company that's been able to create an as-of service, as a service of anything, why wouldn't we see AI as a service in the future? And for Oracle already having artificial intelligence or being one of those core CSPs that really is able to already take advantage of or leverage the Nvidia DGX cloud, which is their artificial intelligence play, that was a shoutout, that was key on the Nvidia earnings call here.And then additionally, got to talk about one of the threats here. And this is deals on two fronts. Number one, deal scrutiny on the first front, elongated sales cycles. You've heard about this on multiple ERP or cloud collaboration suite-type of companies. Workday, this came up on their call. [? Zayo ?] also came up on the call of a company in Zoom, who we spoke to here on Yahoo Finance as well.And particularly, what this elongated sales cycle could mean is that you still see some of the deals that they're looking to net out or, getting pen to paper and signed off on, struggle to fully get across the finish line or take longer to do so. So that could impact some of the results in the near term.But then you also think about the acquire to grow strategy on another side of deal scrutiny. Investors are going to be thinking of this deal scrutiny as, how much are you paying within this acquired growth strategy that has really been popular across the ERP landscape and for some of the broader cloud solutions companies in the market? So that is something that I'm keeping an eye on. Deal scrutiny on two fronts as the major threat here as right-- as of right now. But moving forward, as of this point in time, it seems like there's still a ton of optimism out on the street with regard to Oracle. We'll see what the company does when they report third quarter results in mid to early March, Julie.JULIE HYMAN: Brad, Business Class Brad, remind me what ERP stands for.BRAD SMITH: Enterprise Resource Planning.JULIE HYMAN: Thank you. Thank you very much. OK.]"

There is a relationship between wellbeing and a sustainable working life, which can impact company performance. The higher an employer's ratings are in overall employee wellbeing, culture and climate of wellbeing, performance of wellbeing initiatives and funding allocation toward wellbeing, the better their scores are in workforce resilience, agility and belonging, which make a sustainable working life. Aon surveyed more than 1,100 organizations, finding that employers are increasingly prioritizing wellbeing programs, in both recognizing the issue and aiming to take action. Nearly two-thirds of respondents reported that wellbeing is more important to their company since 2020, and just under half said that employee wellbeing has increased in priority in that same timeframe.Eighty seven percent of companies have at least one wellbeing initiative in place, which was flat compared to 2020. However, 83 percent reported having a wellbeing strategy, compared to 55 percent in the 2020 report.Wellbeing is a key component of an organization's workforce strategy. Integrated as a people and performance approach, the framework for wellbeing balances the appropriate resources, opportunities and commitment needed to achieve optimal health, resilience and sustainability for the individual, team, leadership, organization and community.""Despite companies facing increasing volatility and uncertainty in the form of inflation, a global pandemic, changing workforce patterns and geopolitical conflict, the latest Global Wellbeing Survey demonstrates that employers are still focused on wellbeing, now more than ever,"" said Stephanie Pronk, senior vice president for Health Solutions at Aon. ""Companies are building resilient workforces by increasing their commitment to employee wellbeing both in support and financial investment, which also helps to attract and retain talent. Wellbeing is far from being a niche issue – wellbeing programs that are designed to address the diverse needs of employees can have wide-ranging impacts on an organization.""Story continuesGlobally, 43 percent of companies say they have increased their investment in wellbeing, while most other companies have left investment the same or refocused their investments. The allocation of funding toward wellbeing varies, with about half of companies allocating 2-5 percent of their benefits funding toward wellbeing.Additional findings from the global report include:Employee wellbeing programs have risen in perceived effectiveness since 2020, with 42 percent rating their programs exceptional or above average - an increase from 22 percent in the 2020 report.More organizations are strategically integrating wellbeing into company culture and other business strategies. Eighty percent of employers say wellbeing is fully or partially integrated into their overall business and talent strategy, an increase of 13 percent over 2020. The same number has integrated diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental, social and governance, and total rewards into their wellbeing strategy.The level of importance an organization assigns to wellbeing determines the level of support from leadership, including the C-suite. Only three percent of respondents felt C-suite leaders didn't support wellbeing initiatives at any level, either actively or passively.Aon conducted the survey of human resources and benefits leaders from more than 1,100 companies across 46 countries and multiple industries in collaboration with IPSOS, a leading global market research company, from August to November of 2022.

The move comes as part of the company’s acquisition-driven growth strategy.  Located in Miami’s Countyline Corporate Park, the industrial property is next to TRNO’s seven fully leased buildings within Countyline. It comprises a 121-acre project entitled to 2.2 million square feet of industrial distribution buildings.The completion of the project is expected in 2025 and will have a total expected investment of roughly $491.4 million. The estimated stabilized cap rate of the two buildings under construction is 5% and of the eight buildings to be constructed is 6%. The property’s advantageous location is likely to help attract tenants.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for industrial real estate space has been shooting up. TRNO is banking on such opportunities and is focused on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions.Further, the company is targeting functional assets at in-fill locations. Such assets enjoy high-population densities and are located near high-volume distribution points.With such expansion efforts, Terreno Realty is well-poised to enhance its portfolio in six major coastal U.S. markets — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami and Washington, DC. These markets display solid demographic trends and witness healthy demand for industrial real estate.In the fourth quarter, TRNO acquired four properties comprising three buildings, encompassing roughly 65,000 square feet, and one improved land parcel of roughly 2.8 acres for a total of $59.4 million.For the full-year 2022, Terreno Realty’s acquisition activity included 20 properties. These comprised 17 buildings encompassing roughly 831,000 square feet and 11 improved land parcels of about 35.7 acres for a total of $414.8 million.Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, the industrial real estate space is poised to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including TRNO, Prologis PLD and First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. FR, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Shares of Terreno Realty, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have climbed 9.6% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 1.3%.

Even though economies have reopened, the demand for online shopping is high among consumers. The buoyant demand scenario is pushing up shipping rates, which augurs well for industry participants.Despite the robust demand environment, industry players face quite a few challenges. Supply-chain disruptions and higher fuel costs are likely to keep the bottom line of the companies in this industrial cohort under pressure.Among the air freight and cargo players, United Parcel Service, Inc. UPS and FedEx Corporation FDX have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each of the two stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.United Parcel: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, United Parcel provides letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services.

Dividend Yield (TTM)United Parcel Service, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | United Parcel Service, Inc. QuoteUPS’ strong free cash flow-generating ability is encouraging, supporting its shareholder-friendly activities. In 2022, UPS generated a free cash flow of $9,038 million. Robust free cash flow generation by UPS is a major positive, leading to an uptick in shareholder-friendly activities. Notably, UPS paid dividends worth $5,114 million and repurchased shares worth $3,500 million in 2022. In 2023, UPS expects to make dividend payments of $5.4 billion and repurchase shares worth $3 billion.Concurrent with the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings release, UPS’ board of directors raised its quarterly cash dividend to $1.62 per share, effective from the first quarter of 2023. This marks the 14th consecutive year of a dividend increase. The raised dividend will be paid out on Mar 10, 2023, to all its shareholders of record as of Feb 21, 2023. Additionally, UPS has approved a $5-billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the company’s existing authorization.FedEx: Based in Memphis, TN, FedEx provides transportation, e-commerce, and business services in the United States and internationally. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $51.31 billion.FDX pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.15 ($4.60 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.26% yield at the current stock price.

During fiscal 2022, FedEx repurchased shares worth $2.248 billion (against no share buybacks in fiscal 2021) and paid dividends worth $793 million (higher than the $686 million dividend payout in fiscal 2021).

341,c775c458-e27d-3219-b524-a388505756d0,AXP,2023-03-01,15 Biggest Payment Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-payment-companies-world-212654149.html,1677619614,STORY,"['PYPL', 'GPN', 'EVOP', 'WU', 'BILL', 'EEFT', 'V', 'AXP']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest payment companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Payment Companies in the World. The advent of the Internet has revolutionized business and created new technologies for people to conduct their daily lives. One such area is business, where firms now have access to a global workforce that lets them offshore their tasks to employees in other countries to save up on costs. At the same time, firms can collect their payments digitally as well, which reduces the need of keeping cash at hand for both them and the consumer.At the heart of this facilitation is the payments processing industry. This industry started up along with the internet, as PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) became one of the first firms that disrupted the traditional banking model and enabled users to make and accept payments over the Internet. Since then, both traditional players and new entrants have entered into the market. As a result, the global payments industry was worth a whopping $92 billion in 2021 according to research from Precedence Research. From this, it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.49% until 2030, by the end of which the firm believes it will have an estimated market value of $572 billion.Within the market, there are a couple of trends that are contributing to its growth. These include the widespread adoption of smartphones, which provide users with a convenient way to manage their finances by easily accessing the Internet and using software applications. Additionally, and particularly as the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated, the demand for online shopping is immense, due to the convenience offered in both browsing through items and receiving them without having to leave the comfort of one's home. Zooming in on different industry segments, the one dealing with plastic currency or debit cards forms the largest segment, and companies are also increasingly starting to rely on the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to weed out fraudulent activities on their platform. Artificial intelligence, as futuristic as it sounds, is simply an advanced form of linear regression that reaches conclusions about a set of data points by either using pre-fed parameters or evaluating new data sets. Within fraud detection, this generally involves taking a database of previously fraudulent transactions, and using their specific parameters, such as frequency, amount, and location, to train the algorithm for future events.Story continuesAccounting and financial firm Deloitte takes a deeper look within the industry to further closely analyze what lies in the future for this disruptive and critical sector. It explains that instantaneous - or real time - payment processing will continue to expand in the U.S. as it will expand its coverage to also include business to business and business to consumer use cases. These involve areas such as payroll processing and more. Deloitte adds that the growth of gig economies is also fueling digital payments since workers in several areas do not have access to the traditional financial system such as banking accounts. Deloitte adds that a crucial market area that is gaining traction these days is one where companies act as an intermediary between a bank that has issued a plastic currency card and the merchant that is accepting payments from the card.As the industry starts to mature and more firms enter, existing players are looking at means to improve their customer relationships to retain market share. This was also on PayPal's chief executive officer (CEO) Mr. Daniel Schulman's mind as he explained the steps that his firm is taking to improve the customer shopping experience and improve the ease with which they can carry out transactions with each other. Mr. Schulman's comments came during his company's earnings call for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 as he outlined:We are putting significant resources behind the modernization of our checkout experience in order to defend and grow our market share in our branded checkout business. This includes a drive towards passwordless, one click native in-app experiences as well as deploying the next generation of advanced checkout using our data and AI capabilities. Although this will be a multiyear initiative and will take time given the scale of our base and our legacy integrations, I am extremely pleased with the progress we made last year. We will continue to deliver scaled growth for Braintree. And last year, we made significant progress in modernizing our architecture and capabilities. These improvements resulted in a substantial number of new sales and incremental volume from existing accounts.In addition, we have an impressive pipeline of opportunity for 2023. In the first half of this year, we intend to fully ramp our unbranded offering to small and midsized businesses, either directly or through channel partners. The launch of PPCP, or PayPal Complete Payments, will meaningfully expand our unbranded total addressable market by as much as $750 billion, and enables us to drive incremental share with higher margins than our Braintree Enterprise service. On the consumer side, we’ll continue to enhance our digital wallet value proposition. We are focused on the end-to-end customer experience, from onboarding to the entirety of the consumer life cycle, utilizing more advanced forms of AI to drive optimal consumer choices. In the past two years, we have introduced a significant number of products and services.Today, we'll look at some of the largest payment companies in the world, with the top picks being Visa Inc.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.HeidelbergCement AG has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Martin Marietta has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that HDELY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.HDELY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.37, while MLM has a forward P/E of 24.44. We also note that HDELY has a PEG ratio of 1.25. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. MLM currently has a PEG ratio of 1.87.Another notable valuation metric for HDELY is its P/B ratio of 0.72. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MLM has a P/B of 3.12.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, HDELY holds a Value grade of A, while MLM has a Value grade of C.HDELY sticks out from MLM in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that HDELY is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NiSource Inc. NI, Spire Inc. SR, Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG and Philip Morris International Inc. PM.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:4 Safe Stocks to Buy as Wall Street Posts Worst Week in 2023All three major indexes in the United States suffered weekly losses, and most of the listed stocks ended sharply lower on Feb 24. The S&amp;P 500, the Dow, and the Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly losses in 2023. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 2.7%, leading to its worst week since Dec 9.The Dow fell 3%, its fourth straight weekly loss, and registered its longest weekly losing streak since May 2022, added the Dow Jones Market Data. The blue-chip index also booked its worst weekly percentage drop since September 2022. The Nasdaq, too, finished 3.3% lower and registered weekly losses in two out of the last three weeks.So, what lead to a bloodbath on Wall Street? A hotter-than-expected Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge was primarily responsible for hurting the stock market. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index increased by 0.6% in January, way more than the 0.2% rise in December.Similarly, the PCE Index advanced 5.4% year over year last month from an increase of 5.3% in December. Excluding the volatile food and fuel prices, the PCE Index still increased and all the readings were higher than anticipated.Prices of gas, fuel, and shelter, to name a few, in reality, scaled upward, regrettably, at the beginning of 2023. The consumer price index (CPI) advanced by 0.5% in January and registered an annual gain of 6.4%, easily topping analysts’ expectations. The core CPI also increased by 0.4% last month and 5.6% year over year, more than what market pundits’ have forecast.Story continuesNow, inflation remaining stubbornly higher this year despite showing some signs of ebbing in the latter half of last year has raised concerns that the Fed will continue to remain aggressive in its monetary policy stance. The central bank is expected to continue hiking interest rates to quell inflationary pressure.Most of the market participants at present expect the central bank to increase interest rates by 25 basis points in March as well as in May. Such a move will push the policy rate to reach 5.36% by mid-summer and could remain elevated at that level for the rest of 2023.However, rate hikes increase the cost of borrowing, discourage consumers from spending, and deter economic growth, resulting in volatility in the stock market. Thus, currently, higher inflation leading to rate hike expectations eventually weighed on the markets.But investors shouldn’t panic! They should instead invest their hard-earned money in stocks that provide risk-adjusted returns, like NiSource Inc., Spire Inc., Conagra Brands, Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc.These stocks have a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1) and are dividend players.

This makes them immune to market volatility. These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value StockDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.Tractor Supply (TSCO)Headquartered in Brentwood, TN, Tractor Supply Company is the largest retail farm and ranch store chain in the United States. The company focuses on recreational farmers and ranchers as well as tradesmen and small businesses. It offers a wide array of merchandise such as livestock, pet and animal products, maintenance products for agricultural and rural use, hardware and tools, lawn and garden power equipment, truck and towing products, and work apparel.TSCO sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Value Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of A.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.15 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on March 30, 2023.WBA has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.6%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.15 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11.WBA is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Tractor Supply (TSCO) as well.Tractor Supply is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 20, 2023. TSCO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.71 a share 51 days from its next earnings release.For Tractor Supply, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69 is 0.91%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, WBA and TSCO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Excluding non-comparable sales related to the private label dry pet food and natural beverage and grain businesses’ divestitures, net sales are anticipated to improve nearly 8%.The view reflects the positive impact of elevated net pricing to counter cost inflation in many categories, partly negated by an expected volume/mix effect of the price elasticity of demand and a 2% adverse impact related to the product recall and manufacturing downtime.The adjusted EPS for fiscal 2023 is envisioned in the $8.55-$8.75 band, compared with the earlier $8.35-$8.75 band. The guidance includes an 80-cent impact of the product recall.

This year's report explores how current economic challenges are affecting consumer snacking choices around the world - with a majority of respondents continuing to prioritize snacking, despite rising costs and economic challenges.Developed in partnership with The Harris Poll, the report tracks snacking attitudes and behaviors among thousands of consumers surveyed across 12 countries for a fourth consecutive year. These findings illustrate the expanded role of snacking- as snacking increasingly replaces traditional meals in consumers' lives. Key findings include that consumers around the world are snacking:Daily - Snacking is a staple - 71 percent of consumers snack at least twice a day.Mindfully - 78 percent of consumers report they take time to savor indulgent snacks with 61 percent saying they take time to portion out snacks before eating them.Frequently - Consumers are increasingly replacing meals with snacks, with 55 percent reporting a higher likelihood to eat a snack across all three standard mealtimes.Sustainably - Reducing waste is a top priority, with seven in 10 consumers saying they prioritize snacks that have less packaging and 72 percent saying they typically recycle it.""Our State of Snacking report confirms that in these trying times, consumers around the world view their favorite snacks as affordable and necessary indulgences,"" said Dirk Van de Put, Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz International. ""Snacking continues to be a way for consumers to connect or to enjoy a moment of delight in their day, further demonstrating our belief that every snack can be enjoyed in a mindful way.""Story continuesThe survey demonstrates that consumers are looking for snacks to meet different needs in their lives. The vast majority said they regularly snack to reward themselves (78 percent) and for a sense of comfort (77 percent), including an overwhelming majority of millennials (85 percent for both reasons). The current environment also emphasizes the importance of brand recognition, with 67 percent saying they would buy fewer of their favorite snack brands rather than generic alternatives, regardless of cost.The survey complements Mondelēz International's diverse, proprietary snacking insights knowledge- including macro trends from multiple sources informing the future of snacking and validating the company's focus on delivering the right snack, for the right moment, made the right way.Additional findings from the 2022 State of Snacking report, available for download at www.mondelezinternational.com/stateofsnacking, include:Mindful snackingConsumers are making an effort to be mindful and present while snacking, with 78 percent reporting they take time to savor indulgent snacks.Many are also tuning into portion sizes, saying they take time to portion out snacks before eating them (61 percent) and check nutrition labels on snacks before buying them (68 percent).Meanwhile, less than half (46 percent) say they feel guilty when enjoying an indulgent snack or treat.A way to connectSnacking offers an important opportunity to connect with others, with seven in 10 confirming, ""sharing snacks with others is my love language.""This trend of regularly sitting down to enjoy snacks with loved ones is especially strong among households in India and Mexico.Appetite for sustainabilityConsumers are very focused on how their snacking choices impact the environment - and they recognize that both companies and consumers play key roles in sustainable snacking.63 percent of consumers agree that snacks with a higher environmental impact should cost more, especially millennials (70 percent) and Gen Z (69 percent).64 percent are willing to pay more for snacks that are better for the environment, and 65 percent would pay more for snacks with ethically sourced ingredients.""Today's consumer is more conscious than ever about their consumption - and that includes health and well-being, as well as the impact on the planet,"" said Martin Renaud, Chief Marketing and Sales Officer at Mondelēz International.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that this conference call may not be recorded or rebroadcast without the expressed consent of Ovintiv. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Jason Verhaest from Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Verhaest.Jason VerhaestThanks, Michelle, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and year-end '22 conference call. This call is being webcast, and the slides are available on our website at ovintiv.com. Please take note of the advisory regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of their slides and in the disclosure documents filed on SEDAR and EDGAR. Following prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. Please limit your time to 1 question and 1 follow-up. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Brendan McCracken.Story continuesBrendan Michael McCrackenGood morning. Thank you for joining us. 2022 is a milestone year for Ovintiv. Our team generated a record free cash flow of $2.3 billion and net earnings of $3.6 billion. This achievement was underpinned by our leading capital efficiency. We returned nearly $1 billion to our shareholders through our base dividend and share buybacks, and we reduced our long-term debt by $1.2 billion. We also expanded our future runway with the addition of approximately 450 new premium return locations. These additions were mostly in the Permian, and the acreage offsets our existing positions in Martin, Midland, Upton and Howard Counties. These inventory additions mean that we added more than twice the number of wells that we drilled last year.Our team successfully delivered 10% year-over-year capital efficiencies, which acted to offset significant inflationary pressures. Our team drilled and completed wells faster than ever before and our cube development approach continued to deliver consistent well results while maximizing the value and returns from every acre we developed. The combination of these efforts delivered total annual production of 510,000 BOEs per day, while holding the line on our capital guidance of $1.8 billion. We also made significant gains elsewhere in our business. We were recently included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. In addition, we made significant progress towards our GHG Emissions Reduction Target. We've now reduced emissions intensity by more than 30%, and we are well on our way to meeting our goal of a 50% reduction.In short, in 2022, we delivered tremendous profitability, increased direct returns to our shareholders, bolstered our financial strength, extended our future inventory runway and continued our strong social and emissions performance. These results demonstrate that our strategy is working and our execution is translating into increased value for our shareholders. We had a record-breaking year, and I'm confident our team will continue to deliver leading capital efficiency and durable returns for our shareholders in 2023 and beyond.Our fourth quarter performance meant we ended the year with great momentum, with net earnings of $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $918 million, free cash flow of $537 million and cash flow per share of $3.55, modestly ahead of consensus estimates. Our fourth quarter production came in at 524,000 BOEs per day. Strong well performance across our portfolio drove us to the top end of guidance on oil, gas and NGL. This was despite extreme winter weather across North Dakota, Oklahoma and Western Canada. Kudos to our team, where the weatherization efforts made by our experienced field staff kept our volumes flowing safely and reliably with minimal interruption.We also delivered approximately $250 million to our shareholders through share buybacks and base dividends. And this will increase to $300 million in the first quarter as a result of the strong free cash flow we generated in Q4. We believe that long-term value creation in the E&amp;P space will come from companies that can demonstrate durability in both their return on invested capital and the return of cash to shareholders. Generating durable returns requires a deep inventory of premium return drilling locations, disciplined capital allocation and highly efficient conversion of resource to cash flow. We check all 3 boxes. Our capital efficiency is underpinned by our multi-basin, multiproduct portfolio. Our uniquely balanced portfolio provides operational and commodity diversification, cross-basin learnings and premium inventory depth. Our ability to shift capital to maximize corporate returns is a competitive advantage. We did this in 2022 in response to the Montney permitting slowdown, which is now behind us, and we are making use of this option again in 2023 in response to weaker short-term North American natural gas fundamentals.In our business, access to premium resource is another essential component to generating durable returns. We are continuously evaluating opportunities to extend our runway through both organic appraisal and assessment efforts as well as through bolt-ons. Over the course of the year, we made significant additions to our premium inventory across our asset base. Through organic appraisal and more than 90 transactions, we cost effectively added approximately 450 inventory locations. The biggest focus of this program was in the Permian where we added about 8,000 net acres to our core positions in Midland, Martin, Upton and Howard. The next biggest additions were condensate and oil locations in the Montney. All told, we replaced 2x the number of wells we drilled last year. We're committed to staying disciplined and opportunistic in our bolt-on efforts, and only transacting when we can generate strong full cycle return at mid-cycle pricing. Our inventory renewal efforts make our business more sustainable and help us extend our premium inventory runway across the portfolio. It's worth noting that these inventory adds did not result in incremental proved reserves, both because of the timing of the ads late in the year and the SEC booking rules.It's also worth pointing out that our U.S. oil reserves were flat year-over-year after accounting for the sale of our high-cost mature waterflood in the Uinta Basin in the third quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Corey to discuss our 2023 outlook.Corey Douglas CodeThanks, Brendan. Our 2023 capital plan provides continued strong shareholder returns while keeping our production volumes flat year-over-year. Greg will speak more to the details of the plan later in the call. But at a high level, we intend to execute a resilient, load leveled program, which we've optimized to generate significant free cash flow, maximize capital efficiency and maintain balance sheet strength. We are leveraging our multi-basin, multiproduct portfolio and focusing 100% of our investment in oil and condensate ridge areas.But as always, we have the optionality to shift capital to other parts of our portfolio if economic factors dictate over the course of the year. With 25% of our 2023 oil and gas volumes covered by WTI and NYMEX benchmark contracts, our greatly reduced hedge position allows us to participate in commodity price upside up to $110 a barrel for oil and $8 per MMBtu for natural gas. This is a huge tailwind for us compared to last year. We are well underway today on our first quarter buyback program of $238 million. Collectively, we will return approximately $300 million to shareholders in the first quarter across our base dividend and share repurchases. Our first quarter cash return yield of approximately 11% is very competitive in today's market across both industry peers and the broader economy. We remain committed to delivering substantial returns to our shareholders. Since implementing our capital allocation framework in the fall of 2021, we've returned more than $1.4 billion to shareholders. We see this momentum continuing in 2023 and beyond as we continue delivering a highly efficient development program and removing legacy costs from the business. We also reduced long-term debt by $1.2 billion, and as a result, our leverage at year-end was 0.8x. As expected, we continue to see our U.S. business being cash taxable starting in 2024, as we expect to be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax at current prices. Our cash tax included in our guidance relates to our Canadian business. It is likely to attract cash tax this year based on stronger-than-expected performance in 2022 that consume more tax pools than initially expected. We ended the year with a $381 million of NOLs there. Assuming a $75 WTI price and a $3 NYMEX gas price, we would see $200 million to $250 million of cash tax in Canada. This cash tax will not be payable until early 2024 and will be working capital rather than actual cash used in 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Greg to talk more about our 2023 plan and provide some operational highlights.Gregory Dean GivensThanks, Corey. The development program we implemented last year has strategically positioned Ovintiv for success in 2023. Capital efficiency remains a primary focus for our teams as we work to efficiently convert our inventory into cash flow and generate durable returns for our shareholders. Our 2023 10-rig program delivers annual total production volumes of 513,000 BOE per day, split evenly between liquids and natural gas. This production profile is flat versus 2022 despite selling some noncore assets last year. As Corey mentioned, given the weak outlook for natural gas and NGL prices this year, we have chosen to allocate our capital to the oil and condensate ridge parts of our portfolio as is evident by the lower activity in the Anadarko Basin. As we expected, our first quarter production is set to be the low point for the year, at about 500,000 BOE per day. This profile is driven by a couple of factors. First, and as we outlined in our third quarter call, we intentionally built a drill but uncompleted or DUC well inventory in the fourth quarter. We are limiting our usage of spot crews and taking a methodical approach to bringing these wells online through the first half of 2023.Second, the wells that were brought online at the end of last year were weighted towards the front end of the fourth quarter. This affected production in January and February as we ramped activity back to levels normalized with the rest of 2023. Our Q1 guide also includes the impact of known weather events. We have been thoughtful in our approach to increasingly load level our development programs. And in 2023, we expect to see less variation in turn-in-line cadence setting us up for a more ratable production profile in the second half of the year and going forward. Permian well performance continues to be topical.So I'd like to take a moment to discuss what we've been seeing in the play. We've been active in the Permian for over 8 years and have studied the basin extensively. We've drilled across our entire acreage footprint to delineate the play, and we've entered into numerous data trades with our peers. We led the industry to cube development, which maximizes both recovery and returns. Our approach to stacking and spacing has been very consistent through time. We take a customized concurrent multi-zone development approach in each of our cubes to optimize resource recovery and deliver the highest NPV for every acre of land we develop. The chart on the right shows a tight dispersion of full field development results. Our Permian program, like all development programs, has a statistical variance across wells.But on average, the program delivers consistent performance year in and year out. In the early part of 2022, we had a few pads that performed towards the lower end of the distribution. But as expected, those wells are offset by outperformance seen in the latter part of the year. Heading into 2023, we expect to see consistent performance across our program. And as always, we are actively working to increase resource recovery through our culture of innovation and our cross-basin learning approach. Moving north to the Montney. We're very excited to get back to a more normalized level of activity in the BC part of our acreage. With the recent resolution of a legal dispute between the BC government and the Treaty 8 First Nations, we are well positioned to execute a highly optimized program in the play this year. We have in hand all of the permits required for our 2023 program, and we continue to build our bank of permits for 2024. As a reminder, the vast majority of Ovintiv's position in all our 2023 activity is on freehold lands and therefore, will not be subject to the restrictions that were announced as part of the new consultation agreement. We are continuing to deliver industry-leading results in the play. Over the last 12 months, Ovintiv has brought online 17 of the top 20 wells in the Montney on a BOE basis. We hold a premier acreage position with substantial product optionality. Our premium inventory runway is more than 10 years in the oil and condensate window and more than 30 years in the natural gas window. This year's 4-rig program of 70 to 80 net turn in lines will be largely balanced between our BC and Alberta acreage with a focus on our more liquids-ridge areas. The economics on these wells remain outstanding. Even with current strip pricing, we expect to generate well level returns of more than 100%. These great returns are driven by our superior well results, low drilling and completion costs and strong price realizations. As a reminder, our condensate trades in line with WTI and more than 90% of our natural gas volumes are priced outside of the AECO market. Our Uinta Basin has been generating some top-tier well results, and we are excited to continue development in the play this year. When we look at our resource in the basin, it has all the right characteristics to be highly competitive, both within our portfolio and among the top shale plays in North America. Our large contiguous land base of approximately 130,000 net acres is primed for cube development. It has multiple horizontal intervals with about 1,000 feet of collective pay. This translates into a significant inventory runway.Our Uinta team has delivered impressive well results recently, outpacing the peer average by about 50% and going toe-to-toe with core Delaware Basin results. We have long-term takeaway capacity out of the basin to the local Salt Lake City refining complex, and we recently secured additional scalable rail capacity to the Gulf Coast. As a result, our Uinta oil receives an average price of about 85% of WTI and generates impressive margins.In 2022, the Uinta match the Permian for the highest operating margin in our portfolio. This year, we plan to share 2 rigs between the Uinta and the Bakken to bring on a combined total of 40 to 50 net wells. We've reserved some flexibility around the timing of rig moves between the assets. But at a high level, we currently expect to execute about 60% of our activity in the Uinta and 40% in the Bakken. We continue to be very pleased with the results from our Bakken play. Our recent 10-well Kramer Pad vastly outperformed our expectations and produced an outstanding 2 million barrels of oil in just 200 days.Our Bakken team also did a great job in responding to extreme weather over the last few months and successfully kept our operations running with minimal downtime while bringing on 3 separate pad development projects. We also continue to see strong well results in the play with our recent Kramer development projected to outperform our initial outlook by 25% through 360 days. With the resumption of normalized activity levels in the BC Montney, we have chosen to allocate less capital in the Bakken this year. But as I mentioned, we are taking a flexible approach to our activity by sharing rigs and a frac crew with the Uinta. At roughly 2/3 natural gas and associated NGLs, our Anadarko asset provides great product optionality and provide stable base production with ample market access and strong price realizations. As mentioned earlier, we've chosen to reduce our activity in the play and focus on optimizing asset level free cash flow and operational efficiencies, given the weaker outlook for gas and NGLs in 2023.That said, I'm incredibly proud of the actions taken by the Anadarko team to reduce cycle time. During the fourth quarter, we achieved our best cycle time yet at 94 days, a 30% reduction compared to our 2021 average. They've also done a great job in shallowing out the base decline rate in the play to about 20%, further bolstering the cash generation capabilities of the asset. I will now turn the call back over to Brendan.Brendan Michael McCrackenThanks, Greg. We're delivering outstanding results, and we're well positioned for today's volatility. And with our balanced portfolio, we are also well positioned for the long-term needs of the global energy market. We take great pride in producing safe, affordable, reliable and secure energy while delivering superior returns to our shareholders. In 2023, we'll continue to focus on the following key priorities. Safe work always, executing a disciplined development program focused on maximizing capital efficiency, generating significant free cash flow to enhance returns to shareholders, maintaining our strong balance sheet and continuing to enhance our premium return drilling inventory. Our focus on execution, disciplined capital allocation, responsible operations and leading capital efficiency have positioned our business to thrive on the road ahead. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, we're now pleased to take questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Neal Dingmann at Truist Securities.Neal David DingmannI'm just wondering, it seems like your shareholder return plan seems to be not very stable. I'm just wondering what would it take to cause you to either decide to ramp that payout and change the capital return? I'm just wondering how maybe, Corey, for you or Brendan, how stable is that -- is there things that could cause that to ramp even further?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Neal. I appreciate the question. We've been very consistent with that capital allocation plan and the resulting shareholder returns since we launched it all the way back in the third quarter of 2021. And so we've really kind of followed our playbook there. If you remember, the foundation of that capital allocation model is our base dividend. And we've been pretty clear with our investors that we want to continue to see that base dividend going up with time. We've still got some headroom on the kind of notional level that we set for that to be around $300 million to $350 million a year, which really floats back to the 10% of EBITDA to mid-cycle price range. And so that's probably the first place I'd start and then the second place is the one that you're maybe pointing to, which is, does that percentage of free cash flow march up with time? And really, the plan we've been following there is to both be reducing debt and paying back 50% of that free cash flow to shareholders. And so that's the mode we're in today, but it's something we're always looking at to see what's going to drive the valuation of the equity and be the right thing for the shareholders. So yes, maybe I'll leave it there.Neal David DingmannNo, that's well said. And then maybe just 1 last one for Greg. How different that when you're seeing inflation out in the market versus your different plays when I'm looking at Uinta versus Permian versus Anadarko. I'm just wondering how different is inflation out there today for you?Gregory Dean GivensThanks for the question, Neal. And so we saw quite a bit of inflation throughout the year in 2022. As we ended the year and started into the fourth quarter -- sorry, first quarter, it feels like the rate of change is really subsided, and we're seeing a leveling off. As far as how that affects us across our different plays, we are seeing less inflation in Canada as compared to the U.S. And so we're -- that's one of the reasons why we really like the play there, as I noted in my prepared remarks.OperatorYour next question comes from Greg Pardy at RBC Capital Markets.Greg M. PardyI wanted to -- Brendan, sorry, I'm catching my voice here. Want to come back to the reserve report a little bit, just on the oil side. So pretty significant revisions and so forth that we saw. I'm just wondering where did they -- were they concentrated in any one plan? Is there a little bit more that you could frame around those?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Greg. No, I appreciate it. So the first place to start is on the U.S. oil reserves, total proved year-over-year, it's flat after you adjust for the sale of that Uinta waterflood. And there's really a couple of moving parts to talk to, and I'll get Corey to chime in here, too. But the 2 categories you want to look at are the extensions and discoveries and then the revisions and improved recoveries categories.And if you net the 2 of those together, our approved reserves actually go up by 30 million barrels year-over-year and then you take off the production that we produce through the year, and that's how you get to flat year-over-year after adjusting for that Uinta sale. So maybe, Corey, you want to talk just a little bit about how the process works there and why those 2 categories net together?Corey Douglas CodeGreg, Corey here. Just on the details of how that works, and I'm sure you're familiar, but when we changed our development plan, you actually have to do it by stick. So if you have a stick that's in the original plan last year, you no longer plan to drill it, that comes out as a revision. And then when you rebook and put a different stick in, that comes in as an extension. So net-net, you could leave your development plan exactly the same and have a minus 1 in one category and a plus 1 in the other. So you really do have to look at it on a net basis, even though you have to record them separately.Greg M. PardyOkay. That's really helpful. And then I want to shift gears and it's really kind of a hedging question, and it's around the effectiveness of the 3 ways, not so much when pricing is range bound, but if we look at what's happened with the natural gas market over the last 6 months or so, the 3 ways really aren't giving you much -- much protection given the drop. I'm just wondering what your perspective is there and how you sort of think about 3 ways on a go-forward basis?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. Thanks, Greg. This is really related to the new hedging approach that we're now into. So we've now got a book that reflects that new approach. And if you remember the principles of that approach were to provide downside protection to the business and essentially protect us so that we're going to be free cash flow positive after the base dividend even at the bottom of the cycle for a prolonged period of time. And we kind of have notionally talked about that being something like $40 on oil and $2 on NYMEX for like a 12-month period. And we'd want to be able to drive through that period and be free cash flow neutral to positive after the base dividend. And that's really what our book is designed to protect against. So it's not necessarily designed to capture a market view. It's more of that risk management piece. And the reason that we chose to put 3 ways on as the vehicle for 2023 was because we were able to get a really wide put spread in those 3 ways. And so that protection level is there for the event of that sort of severe bottom of the market, but not necessarily there to take upside off the table, which is really why we chose the 3 ways. I think as we look forward and now we're into thinking about the book for 2024, we'll adapt to the market conditions that are on the board today. And choose amongst the different structures, whether that's fixed price swaps or collars or puts to again put that risk management in place for 2024.OperatorYour next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.Arun JayaramBrendan, I wanted to maybe start with the portfolio renewal. You noted the ability of the company to add 450 sticks through less than $300 million of capital. So I just want to get your thoughts on how you're able to add some of those locations when you think about today, the market price of a premium stick is $2 million to $3 million, and you're able to add those well below that number. And just -- maybe just overall, your updated messaging on portfolio renewals. We've -- generally, in our model, just earmarked about $300 million per annum in CapEx for portfolio renewal. Any change to that messaging?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Arun, I appreciate the call out here. I think -- look, I think we've been really clear. We think one of the keys to generating durable returns is having a deep premium inventory. And we drill a little over 200 wells a year as our '23 plan. So we need to be replacing that as we go is our view. And our strategy is to do that with a combination of both the organic effort to get more locations on the acres we already control, but also the bolt-on approach that you've seen us be following in. And we think we've had very good success in '22 on both of those fronts, and you've seen the numbers. I won't quote them again here. And so that's been the place that we've seen the most accretive to do that work. To your question on the go forward, I think we're just going to keep following that strategy. I think we're very returned and value-focused and we have to do -- like the numbers said, we have to do over 90 transactions to make that happen. So we obviously are very familiar what the market is. And I think for your 300, the one thing that we've said all the way along is that's not going to be ratable because, of course, we don't control the other side of these transactions. So we have to be opportunistic, but that's the approach we're going to take is that over time, it should kind of iron out to that level, but it's probably not going to wind up being ratable, even though it relatively was about that number in 2022. So it's going to be one of these ones where we're just going to have to watch and see how the market develops and how sellers look to optimize their portfolio with time.Arun JayaramGreat. And my follow-up, Corey, I wanted to go back to the cash tax question. In your previous commentary, you suggested that, call it, there'd be kind of a $5 gas price where you thought that you wouldn't really be subject to Canadian cash taxes in 2023. And I think you provided that in the second quarter call. I was wondering if you could help us kind of reconcile what changed, and any forward thoughts on 2024, if you run a maintenance program at a similar $75 and $3 deck in terms of cash taxes next year?Corey Douglas CodeYes, Arun, just I guess, if you think about from that second quarter number, at that point, we were probably seeing it closer to 100. If you took the $5, that's where it got more material. This is all just to emphasize it in case people missed the prepared comments, it's all Canadian tax. And so the realized gas price is probably the biggest driver there. That's where we've got the full 1 Bcf a day out of the 1.5 roughly that we have total. So any market diversification benefits that we have accrued into that Canadian cost center. And so we saw a better performance in the back half of the year than we probably forecast at the time of the Q2 call. So just consume those Canadian NOLs a little bit faster than we thought. So that's really the driver for why it's now $200 million to $250 million at the $75 and $3. And then going forward, the bigger step change is really the cash tax in the U.S. from the AMT that we could likely trigger at these prices, tripping over that $1 billion threshold this year to be -- I don't want to say qualifying for that, but be subject to that next year.OperatorYour next question comes from Gabe Daoud at Cowen.Gabriel J. DaoudBrendan, maybe could we just hit on CapEx a bit. Just curious, another program is heading towards being more level loaded, but is there anything else in the back half of the year that's driving the step down in CapEx? I understand the DUC blowdown will occur in the first half. But as I think about the second half, is there service cost deflation may be being baked in? Or is there intentional DUCs being built again in the second half of the year? Just trying to reconcile that.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Gabe. I appreciate it. Nothing in there around the deflation or the DUC build. So it is just literally the consuming those carryover DUCs in the first half of the year. And then I think you can see on one of the slides, I'm not sure which number it is here, just off the top of my head, but we show the monthly turn in line and essentially works out to about 50 to 60 wells a quarter, and it's going to be pretty smooth month-to-month as well. So that is a huge step change for us year-over-year to get more load leveled and that is going to wind up greatly benefiting 2024, and we thought it was just really important to get that shift made this year. So that's why you're seeing that done.Gabriel J. DaoudThat's helpful. Then maybe as a follow-up for Greg. Could you maybe just give us a little more color around what's going on in the Uinta? Just curious, I guess, what are some of the expectations or goals with the program this year? And as you maybe even think about adding more capital to that moving forward?Gregory Dean GivensThanks for the question, Gabe. And really, as we've said for a few quarters now, we've been pleased with the results we're getting in the Uinta. We're seeing some strong individual well results there. But we've also been working on the takeaway capacity to make sure that we have the ability to get those barrels to market and get paid a fair price for them. And so this is just a continuation of that effort, continuing to delineate that asset and move forward there. But it will continue to be a balanced approach as we continue to evaluate that and use our cube development strategy there and use all of the things that we've learned from all of the other plays that we participated in and to get an optimal result out of the Uinta going forward. So encouraged but a measured approach.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. I think, Gabe, if I just add to that, we've now got over 100 horizontal wells of our own into the play as well as some third-party wells around us. And the acreage position we have is right in the center of the basin. So it's right in the best part of the resource, and we're getting more confidence in the productivity and cost structure of the play. And then as Greg kind of mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's actually a pretty critical point. The Uinta is our highest margin play alongside the Permian in 2022, which is a huge step change for the play from a margin perspective, and that all adds up to better returns there. And -- the only other thing I'd say is part of the reason that margin has enhanced as we sold that high-cost waterflood last year, which took quite a bit of the operating cost out of the asset.OperatorYour next question comes from Lloyd Byrne at Jefferies.Francis Lloyd ByrneBrendan, or maybe, Greg, can you guys just talk a little bit more about what's happened with the type curves in the Permian? I mean the third and fourth quarter to date look better than the first and second. So what changed there? And how does '23 look? And then I have a quick follow-up to Gabe's question, I think.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, I'll flip it to Greg here. But type curve is largely stable year-over-year. You can see that from '21 to '22 to our projected '23. We got real high confidence in that '23 curve. And Greg, you can talk about some of the things you're excited about that the team is doing on completions there to drive that productivity.Gregory Dean GivensYes. I think one of the first things I'd point to is we continue to develop our cubes in the Permian. It's a co-development approach that we've had since we've entered the play. So we overall get very consistent results in aggregate, but there is some variation in the individual well results as you move around the play. The team has really been working most recently on their stage architecture. The amount of spacing between stages, the amount of sand we put in each well and continuing to drive efficiencies there and seeing really positive results, as you saw in the fourth quarter results we showed on the slide. So really, the thing I would point back to is that unlike maybe some other operators, we've not changed our approach over time. We continue to use the same cube development approach across the asset position, continue to optimize our completions on every pad. And despite some variability early in the year, we were really encouraged later in the year with how the results came out, and we feel like that will translate into good performance in '23.Brendan Michael McCrackenOne thing Greg mentioned that I'll just highlight a little bit that I'm excited about is what the team is doing with real-time frac monitoring. So we've been able to make adjustments on the fly because we've got a lot more live telemetry both in the well that we're frac'ing and then in the wells around them. And that's really helping us both from a productivity perspective, but also we think from a cost perspective. So that's an exciting one to keep watching as we go through '23 here.Francis Lloyd ByrneOkay. Great. So '23 looks more like the fourth quarter. And then on the cost structure, is that just scale in the Uinta going forward? And then maybe just give us an idea of how much acreage you guys have there?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. I'll let Greg hit on the acreage, but the cost structure is just scale. So we've been drilling a pretty small program through the last several years to really delineate and get the confidence that we now have. And so we know for sure that as we bring that load-leveled rigs and spread between the Bakken and the Uinta, that's going to help drive those costs down. And we've seen that when you look at -- you remember, we tend to look at these things on the pacesetter basis, and we've got real good indications on the pacesetter front that we're going to be able to drive these costs down with a bit more scale on the program. And Greg, you can talk about the acreage.Gregory Dean GivensYes. On the acreage side, we have 130,000 net acres in the play, and that's with multiple development horizons across that acreage position. And it's still about 80% undeveloped. As Brendan mentioned, we have now around 100 horizontal wells in the play, but have significant running room left there as we go forward and execute on our plans.OperatorYour next question comes from John Abbott at Bank of America.John Holliday AbbottI'm on for Doug Leggate. Our first question, Greg, goes to you. It's on the condensate -- oil and condensate guidance for the first quarter. Understandably, it's lower given the slowdown of activity in the fourth quarter. The quarter is now about 2/3 complete. Just wondering if you could give us an update of where current oil and condensate production may be at. And are we -- have we already seen the lows on oil and condensate production for the quarter?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. John, appreciate the question. The best guidance we give you is we're on track for the guidance we're issuing today. So -- and what was the second part of your question?John Holliday AbbottYes. So what we're trying to understand is it's -- again, it's -- the quarter's 2/3 is complete, right? I mean the guidance is 160,000 barrels per day. And so we're trying to see whether or not we've already seen the lows of production for oil and condensate for the quarter. Are you already moving higher at this point in time? I mean you've had the slowdown in activity in 4Q that drove outlook guidance for this quarter, but are you already on an upward trajectory at this point in time?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, that's a reasonable way to think about it, John. You bet.John Holliday AbbottAll right. And then for our second question is -- I mean, congratulations on the additions to your inventories. What is your thoughts on potential portfolio cleanup in the current environment?Brendan Michael McCrackenI think we've done a fair bit of that over time. And so when you look at how we're allocating capital today, every asset and the portfolio is competing for capital, and delivering free cash flow for the corporation. So we're always going to look at that and think about it is there a way we can enhance the value of the company for our shareholders. But a lot of the cleanup that we've been doing has been done here, so...OperatorYour next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor, Pickering and Holt.Jeoffrey Restituto LambujonMy first one is just if you could elaborate more on the capital efficiencies that you spoke about on what were the most impactful factors there in 2022? How those contributed to that 10% improvement year-to-year last year? And then looking forward, how do you view the repeatability there and then also incremental improvements to be captured this year and what's embedded in the outlook here?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Jeff, appreciate it. I think on the backward-looking capital efficiencies, it was all about just being faster. So drilling faster and completing faster was the big thing as we really embedded Simul-Frac into the portfolio and local wet sand and those, I think, were good winners for us last year. And as you transition and take a more forward-looking view, that's the order of the day, again this year is to keep finding those efficiencies and technical breakthroughs on our drilling and completions in well site facility and short tie in operations, which is where all of our capital goes to. So I think it's just a continuation year-over-year. And we've taken a modest approach to our expectations in terms of how we set that guidance for 2023.Gregory Dean GivensAnd maybe just to build real quickly on the efficiencies for '23. We felt it was really important for the DUCs that we carried over from the fourth quarter that we fill those in to our schedule. So we would have a very level loaded frac schedule this year, which doesn't expose us to spot crew pricing but also just makes the best, most efficient use of the equipment that we have under contract today. So we feel like the efficiencies are only going to improve in 2023 over what we delivered in 2022.Jeoffrey Restituto LambujonPerfect. I appreciate that detail. And then just for my second one, I wanted to ask more on some of the moving pieces from a regional perspective within the capital program for the year, just how to think about Flex points across the assets, maybe starting with the Permian. It looks like the inflation is kind of the primary driver of the year-to-year increase there on spending just given if we look to be similarities in activity and lateral length plans. But -- can you talk about how the contracts there are set up on pricing and how quickly inflation flattening or subsiding could flow through? And then maybe separately as we think about flexibility across the other parts of the portfolio, how do you view the option to add or drop activity outside of the Permian in response to commodity prices or inflation or just other key factors that you might consider there?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, I'll start. Greg can chime in here, too. But we're a little over 1/3 locked in pricing for our capital program this year. It's a little higher than that on rigs and spreads and pipe. So that kind of gives you a sense for -- if we do see some deflation through the year, we would see some of that flow through, although it's probably more of a back half feature, just knowing how the first 2 months of things have been priced. And the -- maybe turn it over to Greg to add anything you want to there.Gregory Dean GivensYes. I think the first thing to point out is we have all of the rigs and crews we need to execute on the program currently working for us today, and we're going to be using those throughout the year. I think as you compare the different plays, we're going to be open to some movement in the back half of the year if that does occur. But the most important thing for us is to focus on efficiency and getting most out of the crews and the rigs that we have. So we feel pretty good about where that's headed, and we'll be able to move capital if we need to in response to lower service costs of 1 basin versus another.OperatorYour next question comes from Roger Read at Wells Fargo.Roger David ReadI just would like to ask, Canada with the LNG expansions coming on the West Coast, how that might have an impact on what you're doing up in the BC area? And any thoughts on timing or capital allocation or something like that?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. Roger, appreciate the question. So the Canadian LNG project continues to progress towards a mid-decade startup. That's an additional 2.1 Bcf a day of takeaway. There's the potential for more projects to FID to add to that in the back half of the decade here. So we're watching that closely. As you've heard us remark in prior calls, we do think the next logical step of price diversification would be to get some LNG exposure in the portfolio. So that's something we continue to evaluate and I think my earlier comments were that nothing particularly imminent on that, but it is definitely something we continue to monitor and look at actively. Remember that the way we've set up our Western Canadian gas price exposure here is we essentially have very minimal AECO exposure all the way through 2025. And so that's a combination of our physical transport into the West Coast and into the Midwest and into Ontario as well as some basis -- hedges that we've got in place. So we really are well insulated and basically have a NYMEX exposed gas portfolio here through the mid-decade when those LNG projects should begin to turn on in Canada and help enhance the sort of structural fundamentals of the AECO market.Roger David ReadThat's helpful. And then I just wanted to come back to some of the comments earlier about decline rates in the Anadarko basin kind of leveling out here. Can you provide us a company-wide first year decline rate indicator?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. We're in the kind of 30% to 35% total corporate decline.Roger David ReadOkay. So not much different than what you're seeing in the Anadarko?Brendan Michael McCrackenThe Anadarko is shallowed out below that. So it's -- the Anadarko is the shallower of the portfolio today. Yes.Roger David ReadSorry, I meant like what you saw in '21, yes, it's declined out as you said, flattened out.OperatorYour next question comes from Umang Choudhary at Goldman Sachs.Umang ChoudharyMy first question was on your program. I mean, one of the focus was to set up a ratable program and it sounds like you expect that to be more level loaded both on spending and on production starting in the back half of this year. You talked about the benefit of completing DUCs in the first half? Can you provide any color in terms of what the dollar amount looks like? And is this a onetime benefit, which we should expect in 2023? Just so that we are mindful of what it means for 2024 and beyond. I understand that there are a lot of things at play here, including potentially some lower service costs.Brendan Michael McCrackenYes, Umang, I appreciate the question. You got it nailed on the progressing to the load-leveled program this year. And the extra DUC capital in the first half of the year is about $80 million. So it's spread between the first 2 quarters.Umang ChoudharyGot you. That's really helpful. And then one other housekeeping question for us, and thanks so much for the update on the Uinta. Can you remind us on the inventory you have left in the Uinta Basin for these high-quality locations, which you've highlighted in our deck?Brendan Michael McCrackenYes. It's kind of an interesting one because, of course, the activity level is still relatively modest there. So the inventory is going to be quite long. So it's sort of decades out there right now. And -- so that will be something we can continue to talk to investors about as we get more data and results in the play. But right now, it's very long.OperatorAt this time, we have completed the question-and-answer session. So I will turn the call back to Mr. Verhaest for any closing remarks.Jason VerhaestYes. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your continued support and interest in Ovintiv.

361,b11069cf-cd93-3f6e-bc06-984d86dc2294,COF,2023-03-01,Ken Fisher’s 15 New Purchases/Additions,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ken-fisher-15-purchases-additions-194201885.html,1677613321,STORY,"['COF-PJ', 'DIS', 'NOW', 'JCI', 'BAC', 'TGT', 'LRCX', 'UL', 'CRM', 'ITW', 'GOOGL']","[In this article, we discuss Ken Fisher's 15 new purchases/additions. If you want to skip the investment philosophy of Ken Fisher and the detailed analysis of Fisher Asset Management, go directly to Ken Fisher's 5 New Purchases/Additions.Ken Fisher, the founder, executive chairman and co-chief investment officer of Fisher Asset Management, predicts that the market conditions in 2023 will resemble those of 1967, as outlined in an article posted in the New York Post. In 1966, inflation was high, there were concerns about a possible recession, and the US Federal Reserve was increasing benchmark interest rates to counter inflation. The S&amp;P 500 Index experienced a 22% decline that year, similar to the 2022 market conditions. However, the market recovered in the fourth quarter of 1966, with a 6% gain, and recorded a YoY rise of 24% in 1967. The current market has also staged a comeback, with a 7.2% gain since October 2022.In one of the interviews, Ken Fisher suggested that investors can position their portfolio to benefit from a new bull market bounce by investing in categories that have dropped the most during the bear market. He said that we are currently in the early stages of a new bull market that began in October 2022 and expects sectors that were hurt the most last year, such as information technology and other growth-oriented sectors, to perform well in the first part of this new bull market. Ken Fisher also noted that sectors and categories that did well during the recent bear market, such as energy, tend to underperform during the initial bull market bounce, which may seem counterintuitive to some investors. Ken Fisher's 15 New Purchases/AdditionsRegardless of whether a new bull market is already underway or not, Ken advised investors to expect the market to bounce in the near future and suggests investing in categories that suffered the most during the downturn as a way to benefit during a market recovery.Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management 13F portfolio value also increased from $133.41 billion in Q3 to $147.93 billion in Q4 2022. The fund made 145 new purchases in the fourth quarter, additional purchases in 440 stocks, sold out 168 equities, and reduced holdings in 389 stocks. Some of the popular companies in which Ken Fisher made additional/new purchases in his Q4 portfolio include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we focused on the top 100 positions and identified the biggest additions/purchases in the fourth quarter of 2022. Then, we picked the top 15 new purchases/additions in Ken Fisher's top 100 positions.Ken Fisher's New Purchases/Additions15. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 7% The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a media and family entertainment company with a global reach. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners is a significant position holder in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), with approximately 9.03 million shares. Following a limitation period, JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick initiated coverage of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) on February 13 with an ‘Overweight’ rating and a price target of $135. The analyst informed investors in a research note that the business announced good fiscal Q1 earnings, led by improved Parks profitability and decreased direct-to-consumer losses. In addition, the business is driven by newly appointed CEO Bob Iger's transformation agenda.Ken Fisher added The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) to his portfolio in Q4 2010 by buying 5,904 shares worth $221,000. Fisher Asset Management increased its hold in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) by 7% in the fourth quarter, ending the period with 5.47 million shares of the company. The stock accounts for about 0.32% of the hedge fund’s portfolio, as Fisher Asset Management owns a $474.84 million stake in the company.Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the new purchases/addition in Ken Fisher’s 13F investment portfolio. Madison Funds made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) reported a disappointing fourth quarter with revenue and earnings below consensus which was followed by the board replacing then-CEO Bob Chapek and the return of Bob Iger as CEO. Parks remained a bright spot while losses at direct-to-consumer increased and linear networks continued to be challenged by cord cutting.”14. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 7%Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a general merchandise shop in the United States.

Although sales were slightly better than expected, Target saw a slowdown in discretionary sales. Gross margins were below expectations with higher markdowns, increased shrink, and incremental costs. Long-term, we expect Target to be able to return to operating margins in the 6% to 8% range as inventories return to normal levels as well as seeing a normalization in supply chain costs.”13. Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 8%Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) produces and distributes industrial items and equipment worldwide.

Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 8%Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) provides a variety of business and retail banking, credit card, and other financial services. With over 100 million clients, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is a major participant in the credit card industry. In the past, the corporation has targeted customers with less-than-ideal credit ratings with its offers. What is shockingly obscure, though, is that Capital One is one of the largest full-fledged banks in the country, in addition to being the principal lender behind its cards. It presently holds assets worth close to $400 billion and loans totaling more than $300 billion.Securities filings for the third quarter of 2015 reveal that Ken Fisher added Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) to his portfolio by acquiring 7,189 shares worth $521,000. In the fourth quarter of 2022, he increased his stake in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) by 8%, and his 0.58% stake in the company is now worth about $870.33 million.Based on 6 buy ratings, 6 hold ratings, and 3 sell recommendations, Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has a consensus rating of ‘Hold.’ Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)’s largest investor is Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates, which owns 12.60 million shares of the company.Here is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Additionally, we initiated a position in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) during the quarter. Capital One is one of the largest issuers of Visa and Mastercard credit cards in the U.S. The company also has a banking network, offers auto and home loans, and manages assets for institutional and high-net-worth clients. We like that Capital One possesses a strong capital position and a common equity tier-1 ratio that exceeds both regulators’ requirements as well as the company’s own internal target. We appreciate the company’s good underwriting track record and its history of lower than expected loss rates given its business mix and yield. In our view, Capital One’s management team is focused on the long term as evidenced by its consistent reinvestment in technology development, and its online/branch bank provides a stable deposit base with decent funding cost. At roughly 5x 2022 consensus earnings and 1.1x tangible book value per share, the stock trades at a significant discount to the market and our estimate of intrinsic value.”]11. Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) creates, produces, commissions, and retrofits building systems and products internationally and in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

Once a multi-industrial corporation, the company successfully turned itself into a pure-play buildings solutions and technology provider. Catalysts we previously identified for Johnson Controls included synergies following its merger with Tyco International, which provides fire safety and building security products, as well as benefits from its separation of non-building-focused businesses, such as automotive seating and batteries. With all catalysts in sight now nearing completion, and Johnson Controls now a better business for it – with higher recurring revenues and lower capital intensity – we decided to exit our investment to help fund the purchases of Xcel Energy and Atmos Energy.”10. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) offers cloud-based solutions for defining, structuring, administering, and automating enterprise services throughout North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, and other regions. SCGE Management, with 935,100 shares, is the biggest stakeholder in the company.Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management bought  108,079 more shares of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in Q4. This amount represents a 9% increase over Fisher holdings in ServiceNow relative to the prior three-month period. According to the diversified holding company's 13F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Fisher Asset Management initially took a stake in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in the second quarter of 2014.In the last quarter, the company had 1,637 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract revenue. In addition, ServiceNow, Inc.

The business produced great software outputs and suggestions in a difficult situation, the analyst claimed in a research report.Polen Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”9. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 9%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a bank and financial holding corporation that provides banking and nonbank financial services. Bank of America has a 'Moderate Buy' consensus rating based on 7 buy recommendations, 5 hold ratings, and 2 sell ratings.In Q4 of 2022, Fisher Asset Management ramped its stake in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock by 9%.

Legendary investor and billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), as of the end of the fourth quarter. Here is what Ariel Investment said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“We initiated three new positions in the quarter. We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 10%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the world's largest provider of CRM software and one of the stocks in which Fisher Asset Management has increased its holdings.

(NYSE:CRM).On February 15, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow boosted his price objective on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) from $180 to $195 while maintaining an ‘Overweight’ rating on the stock. According to the analyst, finding interesting stories in software for Q4 earnings would be challenging.Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”7. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Percentage Increase in Stake in Q4: 11%Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is a significant household and personal care product manufacturer.

The fund owns more than 5.46 million shares of stock, which are worth $275.06 billion.Here is what Fundsmith said about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) in its 2022 yearly investor letter:“Last year I wrote about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) and attracted a virtual tsunami of comment for my remarks about Unilever, purpose and Hellmann’s mayonnaise. Events soon overtook this commentary insofar as Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners announced that it had bought a stake in Unilever and he was invited to join the board. We are asked to suspend disbelief that this was in no way linked to the subsequent announcement that Alan Jope will be leaving the CEO role. This explanation sounds like it was lifted from the script of Miracle on 34th Street.…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

364,f3321510-956b-345a-9a8b-ad46ef7eee9b,TXT,2023-03-01,15 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-airplane-manufacturing-companies-030452916.html,1677639892,STORY,"['BA', 'TXT', 'LMT', 'ERJ', 'GE']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest airplane manufacturing companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the World. When it comes to high technology, the aircraft industry ranks right at the top of the food chain, alongside semiconductor fabrication and astronautics. The modern day jet aircraft - whether civilian or military - has hundreds of thousands of parts which are often shipped from all over the world for final assembly into the beast that takes to the skies.Naturally, this amount of complexity makes for high barriers to entry into the industry and leaves only a handful of firms that are able to make and sell airplanes. Due to their size, jets also take months to assemble and end up costing millions of dollars. This high cost also makes the aircraft manufacturing industry one of the most lucrative in the world - and one which sees little threat from new entrants. For instance, a research report from Polaris Market Research outlines that the aircraft manufacturing market was worth $413 billion in 2021 and that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.7% between then and 2030 to be worth an estimated $626 billion by the end of the forecast period.As is the case with nearly every high tech industry, perhaps except semiconductors, Polaris Market Research also highlights that North America was the largest aircraft manufacturing market in 2021 with a large demand for next generation airplanes fueling the growth. However, despite being the largest, North America will not be the fastest growing sector, as this title will go to Asia Pacific which is fueled by the growing populations of India and China spurring demand and increasing the need for planes to fly people around.The aircraft industry is also evolving, with new manufacturing and computing technologies providing companies the opportunity to improve their operations. One interesting innovation that has made its way to the manufacturing line is the use of smart glasses. These are eyewear that comes equipped with digital displays and provides the assembly technician useful inputs throughout their activities. For instance, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which is one of the world's largest aircraft manufacturers, has found that using these wearables in its wire harness assembly has enabled it to reduce production time by a massive 25%. Boeing is not the only one that uses smart glasses in the aircraft supply chain. One of the world's most advanced jet engine manufacturers, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), has been researching their use since 2017 and found that not only did the mechanics who are responsible for tightening nuts on fuel lines see their productivity improve by 8% due to smart glasses but that 85% of those surveyed said that they reduced errors and 60% preferred using the wearables.Story continuesAnother trend in the industry is the push towards sustainable aviation fuels since air travel is among the leading sources of carbon dioxide emissions. On this front, Boeing announced in February 2023 that it plans to procure 5.6 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel for its 2023 flight operations, more than doubling last year's procurement and accounting for a quarter of the aerospace giant's total fuel needs. Not to be left behind, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is looking at the future as it is designing aircraft that reduce fuel use through their airframe. NASA's Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project aims to invest $425 million with Boeing over seven years as part of the White House's Climate Action Plan.At the same time, demand for conventional aviation is also booming, with Boeing's chief executive officer (CEO) Mr. Matt Welch sharing an update during the firm's fourth quarter of 2022 earnings call held in January 2023. Mr. Welch sounded optimistic about his company's future, sharing that demand was strong across Boeing's portfolio, as he explained that:On the order front and on the market side, we continue to see very strong demand across the portfolio. More than 800 net orders on the year, driven by the 737 MAX and the 787, highlighted most recently by the very historic deal with UAL, United Airlines in December. In 2022, we sold 200-plus net wide bodies. That’s the most since 2018. More broadly, the 737 MAX team has made tremendous progress. Fleet is performing exceptionally well. Production is stabilizing, demand is strong. We delivered 1,000-plus 737 MAXs in total now. And since our return to service, the fleet has surpassed 3 million flight hours. It’s safe and it’s the most reliable of the airplane fleets.

""We are going to be laser-focused on the cleanup and to continue to protect the public from any kind of harm.""Former U.S. President Donald Trump and some other Republicans criticized the Biden administration's handling of the derailment. The administration in turn slammed Trump and his Republicans for slackening rail safety and environmental protections measures when they ran the government.Regan, who postponed a trip to West Africa to make Tuesday's Ohio visit, said federal agencies would stay in the area, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2020, for as long as it took to bounce back from the disaster.On Monday, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said it was opening an inquiry into the EPA's actions following the derailment. Republicans on the committee sought information on the EPA’s response and monitoring.East Palestine resident Ted Murphy, 58, had to leave his home close to the derailment. He said his throat burns and his nose runs when he returns to the property to pick up possessions.Chemicals from the derailment washed into streams and heavy rain on Monday churned up pollution, he said.

It has previously dropped stocks that don't meet its ESG standards.""Fizzy drinks are not necessarily something that are very much aligned with any of the sustainable development goals,"" Eric Christian Pedersen said in an interview.He also cited worries about future demand for products seen as unhealthy because of their high sugar content.""We've for a long time – other things being equal - been less likely to want to bet on them in the funds that we market as especially responsible or sustainable. But they're not necessarily automatically out, and a good engagement process and trajectory on some of the key issues helps,"" he said.The Coca-Cola Company declined to comment, while Pepsico did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Consumer groups have long worried about the dietary impact of fizzy drinks, while environmental activists have highlighted the impact of single-use petroleum-based plastic bottles and manufacturers' use of sometimes scarce water resources.In 2021, global coalition Break Free From Plastic named Coca-Cola as the world's worst plastic polluter for the fourth year in a row.Coca-Cola said last year it aimed for 25% of its packaging globally to be reusable by 2030, up from 16% in 2020.PepsiCo said in 2021 that it aimed to reduce virgin plastic per serving across all brands by 50% by 2030 and focus on healthier food, and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 2040.NO EXCLUSIONNorway's largest pension fund KLP said it has not cut its stake in fizzy drinks makers over concerns about ESG issues but that ""plastic consumption is a big issue, as are waste and the circular economy when it comes to their business"".Story continuesCoca-Cola Europacific Partners bottles and sells Coca-Cola products in Western Europe, Australia, Indonesia and New Zealand. It has had ""very open discussions with Nordic investors in particular"" on various issues, finance chief Nik Jhangiani said in an interview.""Sometimes I don't think they fully have in the past appreciated what we're doing,"" he said.NAM, which manages around 239 billion euros ($254 billion) in assets across a range of strategies, had discussed its concerns with both Coca-Cola and Pepsico, Pedersen said.""The more they can ensure that their packaging was recycled and did not end up in landfill - that their water use did not harm local populations and so on - the more positive the outlook on them would be,"" he said.Nordic financial groups have been at the forefront of ESG-investing and past actions, like pulling out of some tobacco, coal and oil companies, have been followed by some other funds.In 2020, NAM excluded shares of Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA worth about 40 million euros from all its funds, based on the company's environmental record and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Referring to Nordic investors' reduced interest in fizzy drinks companies, Bernstein analyst Callum Elliot said: ""This triggers uncomfortable memories of the de-rating suffered by tobacco stocks. Could beverage companies be the next in line?""But Pedersen said Nordea will continue to invest in those that make the best efforts to improve their ESG credentials.""Do you want to exclude everything that smells bad, or do you want to go into individual sectors and industries and try and find some ESG high-performers that can help move the industry?"" he said.($1 = 0.9406 euros)(Reporting by Richa Naidu in London and Gwladys Fouche in Oslo; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Catherine Evans)]"

(NYSE:KO) reported earnings results in the middle of February that were very positive. Organic growth for the quarter was well above already very high estimates. The company also recently announced a dividend increase to extend its impressive dividend growth streak.Shares of the company are down over the last year, but still ahead of what the S&amp;P 500 Index has returned as the index is lower by more than 9% over this period of time.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with KO. Click here to check it out. KO 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KOPeter Lynch Chart of KOCoca-Cola Has Value After EarningsThis discussion will examine why the positive earnings story, including an outlook for 2023, makes the stock appealing.Earnings highlightsCoca-Cola reported fourth-quarter and full-year earnings results on Feb. 14. Revenue for the quarter grew more than 6% to $10.1 billion and was $180 million above analysts expectations. Adjusted earnings per share of 45 cents matched the prior years result and was in line with estimates.For 2022, revenue improved 11% to $43 billion, while adjusted earnings per share of $2.48 compared favorably to $2.32 in the prior year.Organic growth was very strong at 15% for the quarter versus estimates of 11.1%. For the year, organic growth was 16%.The improvement in fourth-quarter organic growth was due almost entirely to pricing, which added 12%, and product mix, which contributed 2%, as volume was lower by 1%. An extra day during the reporting period did add 1% to results.Coca-Cola also provided an outlook for the year. The company expects organic growth of 7% to 8% for 2023, ahead of analysts estimates for a gain of 3.6%. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to grow 4% to 5% from 2022 levels.TakeawaysThe organic growth rate for Coca-Cola for both the quarter and year were very notable, especially considering these followed high figures in the previous periods. For example, organic growth was 9% and 16% for the fourth-quarter and full year 2021, respectively. The companys performance in the most recent reporting period is not off an easy comparable period.Story continuesIn fact, topping tough comparison has been the case for some time as Coca-Cola has produced outstanding organic growth nearly every quarter since the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Including guidance for the current year, the company's three-year stack rate for organic growth would be almost 40%. Not bad for what many investors might consider to be a boring consumer staples company.It was not just a portion of the business that carried results for the quarter as gains were seen in every region, with Latin America higher by 32%, Bottling Investments showing growth of 16%, Asia Pacific up 15%, North America increasing 12% and Europe, the Middle East and Africa improving 9%.Just as important, the gains on the top line flowed directly to the bottom line. Operating income increased 24% for the quarter and 6% for 2022. The comparable operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 22.7%. While costs are up for Coca-Cola, much like they are for many peers, the company is extracting more profits from its sales.This reflects favorably upon the companys brand portfolio, which continues to resonate with consumers. Management noted the company gained value share in the total nonalcoholic beverages ready-to-drink market, with strength seen in both at-home and away-from-home channels.Price action, taken to offset higher inflationary costs, did drive the vast majority of gains for the company. The positive news for investors is that this did not cause a drastic decline in volume as unit cases barely declined in the fourth quarter. Volume was actually up 5% for 2022, demonstrating that consumers are willing to spend on the companys products. Coca-Cola faced a tough comparison here as well as unit cases sold were higher by 8% in 2021, but the company still was able to post higher figures.Unit cases sold did decline 5% in the EMEA and 1% in the Asia Pacific regions in the fourth quarter, but all other areas of the company were up for the period. All regions and businesses showed unit case growth for the full year.Finally, Coca-Cola raised its quarterly dividend 4.5% to 46 cents on Feb. 16, extending its dividend growth streak to 61 years.Valuation analysisCoca-Cola is currently trading at approximately 23 times expected earnings per share for the year. This is very close to the long-term average according to Value Line.The GF Value Line shows the stock is near its fair value based on its historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings projections.Coca-Cola Has Value After EarningsPresently, Coca-Cola has GF Value of $65.36, which gives the stock a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.92. Reaching the GF Value could mean a return of 9%. Factor in the current yield of 3.1% and total returns could reach into the low double-digit range.Final thoughtsOverall, Coca-Colas most recent report showed strong results in nearly every area of the company and organic growth easily topped what analysts had anticipated. Guidance for 2023 shows that Coca-Cola should be able to continue its streak of high rates of organic growth as well.Due to this, I believe investors looking for a high-performing consumer staple name with a long history of dividend growth should consider adding Coca-Cola to their watchlist.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 biggest public companies in the world.While much maligned, and often rightly so, the biggest public companies in the world aren't just intrinsically linked to economic growth and development, but also to the significant improvement in quality of life that mankind has enjoyed in the last few decades. This is why most countries in the world attempt to provide incentives and tax breaks to companies because of the economic improvements and jobs that such corporations provide.So what is the main difference between a public and a private company? A private company is generally owned by founders, management or private investors. On the other hand, a public company has at least a significant portion of its shares held by the general public, also known as free float. This percentage depends on the regulations of a country but is generally at least 25%, which means that the founders may still control the company even if is listed. When a company starts to grow significantly and needs more capital, it offers its shares to the publics in an initial public offering, or IPO, by getting listed on a stock exchange, and you can easily learn more about the biggest IPOs of all time.25 biggest public companies in the worldPhoto by Campaign Creators on UnsplashBecause a public company's shares are owned by the general public, the regulations that it must follow are much more stringent than for private companies, including publishing annual reports, quarterly reports, any material information updates, ESG and much more. The biggest public companies in the world are worth more than the GDP of most nations worldwide, so you can understand the power and influence that these companies possess.While there are some countries without stock exchanges, most have a stock exchange, or even multiple, with more than 40,000 companies listed globally. Of these, only 10% are located in the U.S., but because of its advanced economy and favorable laws and regulations, the vast majority of the biggest public companies in the world are located there. Overall, Asia has the largest number of listed companies which account for close to 37% of the global market value. Because of the recent appreciation in the U.S. dollar, U.S. companies are more dominant than ever in terms of market capitalization. An interesting statistic according to the Organization of Economically Developed Countries in 2019 was that in half of the global listed companies, just three holders held more than 50% of the capital, showing the concentration of both influence and wealth.Story continuesThe biggest public companies in the world have a total market cap of over $22.5 trillion, more than a fifth of the global GDP in 2021, according to the World Bank. These companies dominate the industries they are in and come from a variety of sectors, though tech companies are present thoroughly throughout the list. To determine the largest listed companies, we checked their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance, and where the company was listed on a foreign stock exchange, converted the number to USD for consistency.

The company’s numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow in addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.Mastercard’s growing footprint in the crypto universe can position it for long-term growth. It is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows MA to pursue acquisitions and deploy capital.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Raytheon Technologies have gained +7.6% over the past six months against the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry’s gain of +10.6%. The company continues to receive ample orders for its combat-proven defense products. A steady recovery in commercial air traffic continues to boost commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for Raytheon. The stock holds a solid solvency position.However, economic sanctions imposed by governments in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might hurt Raytheon. A comparative analysis of its trailing 12-month Price/Book ratio indicates a relatively gloomy picture, which might be a cause for investors’ concern. The appreciating U.S. dollar has been burdening airlines, which may hurt the stock.(You can read the full research report on Raytheon Technologies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)BP’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+41.1% vs. +20.2%). The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, backing impressive production growth. It boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects was met successfully.BP set an aggressive energy transition plan to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy. Although there is no production from its Russia incorporated joint ventures, BP is projecting higher upstream volumes this year. Before reporting its December-quarter results, the energy major is willing to complete an additional $2.5 billion in share buy-backs.However, the leading integrated energy company’s balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Also, increasing production &amp; manufacturing costs have been affecting the company's income.(You can read the full research report on BP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include CVS Health Corporation (CVS), ICICI Bank Limited (IBN) and Uber Technologies, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Income-generating stocks are all the rage as the stock market suffered huge losses last year. According to a report by Reuters, Wall Street recorded its biggest annual drop in 2022 since the financial crisis of 2008, as the S&amp;P 500 shed nearly $8 trillion in market cap. Growth stocks also recorded their worst performance in a decade, turning investors’ attention toward overlooked dividend equities.Quality companies that have raised their payouts for a significant period are considered safe during fluctuating market conditions. Historical analysis of these stocks shows that they have outperformed their peers when turbulence in the market occurs. Over the past five decades, dividend growers have surpassed other asset classes when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually, as reported by Sterling Capital. Another reason why dividends make reliable investments is due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. According to a report by Schroders, the average annual return across eight markets was 4.3% in the last 25 years, which increased to an average of 7.1% including reinvested dividends.Analysts often advise investing in companies that have proven track records of dividend growth, as these companies are likely to continue growing their payouts in the long term. In addition to this, such companies are considered less risky as they have stable cash flows and histories of profitability. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some major dividend companies with solid dividend growth streaks and strong balance sheets. In view of this, we will discuss the best consistent dividend stocks to buy in this article.Story continues16 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for at least 10 years.

(NYSE:WSM), worth over $305.3 million collectively.Voss Capital mentioned Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We believe shorting furniture retailers has arguably become a consensus view on the back of widely known tough comps from early 2021 (+26% and +40% SSS Comps for WSM in calendar Q1/Q2 ‘21) and fear of pull forward of demand, which seems to be corroborated by weak credit card data in the category the last few weeks and a poor outlook from furniture e-Commerce giant Wayfair, not to mention a panic-inducing, rambling conference call from the oft colorful CEO of Restoration Hardware. Lazy thematic macro analysis that stops there, however, paints an incomplete picture of what has transpired at many individual companies like WSM that have been deemed COVID beneficiaries that are now at all-time low valuations.WSM is a furniture and home décor retailer that owns several well-known brands: William Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Rejuvenation, Mark &amp; Graham, and most importantly, west elm. While perhaps thought of as a dying mall-based brick &amp; mortar retailer, WSM derives the vast majority (66%+) of its revenue from e-Commerce and has been a remarkably steady performer, remaining free cash flow positive every year since at least 2007 and achieving positive same store sales comps since 2010, including +17% in 2020, +22% in 2021 with guidance for a further mid-to-high single digit growth again this year. Within the overall positive sales trends, west elm’s consistent growth has been even more impressive, with a 16% average annual same-store sales growth rate since 2012. To little fanfare, by our calculation, WSM has become the single highest quality retailer in public markets with a 58% return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2021 and a 39% ROIC on average over the past 3 years…” (Click here to see the full text)14.

Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments.

In this context, CASY served its purpose.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 High Growth SaaS Stocks that are Profitable. Cloud computing is one of the hottest industries right now, with the advent of large scale computing enabling firms to avail a vast variety of services digitally. One important and crucial segment of the broader cloud computing industry is the software as a service (SaaS) industry. This sector, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), consists of all industries that deliver software applications over a network (you can check out some SaaS companies at 10 Profitable SaaS Companies for 2023). This provides numerous applications, that range from the everyday user accessing digital services such as collaboration platforms to firms accessing supply chain and logistics data over a network instead of physically monitoring their operations.Naturally, these diverse use cases lend the SaaS industry some lucrative valuations, despite the fact that they primarily sell software products that do not have the advantage of strong or high prices typically enjoyed by hardware. For instance, while an iPhone can cost you anywhere in excess of $1,000, a Netflix subscription costs significantly less. Placing a dollar figure on the SaaS industry's value, a research report from Fortune Business Insights reveals that the industry was worth $215 billion in 2021. In just a year, or by the end of 2022, the firm believes that the sector would grow to $251 billion. From then onwards to 2029 end, it outlines that the sector can grow through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.7% to be worth an estimated $883 billion by the end of the forecast period.It adds that the industry is growing because of a variety of factors such as the need for a central data analytics platform and cross collaboration across different software. Fortune Business Insights also mentions the growing role that artificial intelligence is playing in the industry as it shares that the SaaS part of a business's operations is being significantly transformed due to the integration of both AI and machine learning tools. Additionally, the market itself is segregated into various sectors such as enterprise resource management, analytics, and collaboration. Out of these, collaboration should outpace the market in terms of growth, with an estimated CAGR of 21.8%.Story continuesThis explosive growth is also clear when we analyze companies that report most of their revenues from SaaS.

As is the case in other industries too, firms with lower market capitalization are currently experiencing explosive growth.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Payroll Companies in the World. Today's corporate world is significantly different from companies of the past. The growth in industries and employment often leaves firms with thousands of employees and makes managing their needs a complex task requiring additional investments and teams which end up diverting attention from their strategic business operations and objectives.To respond to these needs, companies that provide services such as human resources management have sprung up, which allows employers to outsource these functions in order to save up on significant capital expenditures. One such sector is the payroll industry, which consists of firms that offer software products to enable employers to manage their employees and outsourcing solutions that completely take over the function.As the economy and industry grow, this sector itself is worth billions of dollars. According to a research report from Vantage Market Research, the global human resource payroll software market was worth $25 billion in 2021 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9% between then and 2028 to sit at an estimated $46.6 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that several advantages offered by the software such as consolidating several human resources functions under a single roof, tracking working workings, and providing adequate security are key reasons that many companies prefer it.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Trane Technologies has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Evoqua Water has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that TT's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.24, while AQUA has a forward P/E of 51.75. We also note that TT has a PEG ratio of 2.27. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AQUA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.45.Another notable valuation metric for TT is its P/B ratio of 6.95. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AQUA has a P/B of 8.13.These metrics, and several others, help TT earn a Value grade of B, while AQUA has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesTT is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

The value of global LNG trade doubled last year to more than $450 billion, according to the International Energy Agency.Aramco is looking at projects in the US and Asia, one of the people said. Its preference would be for a facility that can easily ship the super-chilled fuel to Asia, the world’s biggest market, another person said.The company declined to comment.Investment NeededGetting a stake in an LNG plant and a supply deal would help Aramco with its aim of diversifying beyond oil and gas production into the lucrative world of energy trading.More investment in liquefaction projects is needed to avoid a widening LNG supply gap later this decade, Shell Plc said in a report last month.Aramco previously considered venturing into LNG in 2019, and looked at buying 25% of Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur facility in Texas. But it pulled back as the coronavirus pandemic weighed on energy demand and hammered its finances. A non-binding 20-year agreement for Aramco to sell LNG from Port Arthur expired in 2021.Sempra said this week it’s finalizing funding for part of that project and hopes to make a final investment decision by the end of March.Story continuesBig ReservesSaudi Arabia has some of the world’s biggest gas reserves, though they’ve mainly been used for the domestic market.Aramco is trying to change that and plans to spend around $100 billion in the coming decade to boost gas production in the kingdom. But it has no intention to make LNG at home. Instead, it’ll use the extra supplies to meet rising local demand and to export blue hydrogen, a fuel made by converting gas.(Updates with Aramco declining to comment.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMicrosoft Expands Game Pass as Regulators Fret Over Activision DealRussian Airlines Are Flying High Despite SanctionsGina Raimondo Becomes China Player in a Job Where Her Predecessor Used to NapThis Road Could Save the Planet—and Carve Up Alaskan WildernessThe NFL’s Top Talent Agency Bought by Venture Investors©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

AI-hungry investors have propelled Nvidia Corp., which makes the chips needed for complex AI computing tasks, into the best-performing stock among mega-caps this year. Relatively obscure firms with AI in their names have also skyrocketed. BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. has surged more than 300%, while C3.ai Inc. and BuzzFeed Inc. have more than doubled. Guardforce AI Co. is up 51%.A lot of the companies tossing around the phrase AI are just taking advantage of the hype. Some are speaking aspirationally about how they see AI transforming their businesses — one day, some day. And then there are the real, practical use cases for AI and machine learning that companies have been actively investing in, developing and using — in some cases, long before AI became a buzzword — proving that the power of these algorithms is already reaching far beyond chatbots to change everything from the way companies manage their parts inventories to how they're recruiting for job candidates.“It is impossible to quantify what the impact of AI could be and equally possible that a wave of enthusiasm carries stocks with expertise in or exposure to AI, no matter how tenuous, higher and higher,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell Plc. “All investors can do is stick to their disciplines and focus on competitive position, management, and valuation, while making sure that they truly understand the business, before they put any capital at risk.”Story continuesThe tech-focused Nasdaq 100 Index traded slightly lower at the open on Wednesday.

AI is also used to increase consumer interactions with ads. “AI has been foundational to our ads business for the last decade,” he said.During Meta Platforms Inc.'s own earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said AI is “the foundation of our discovery engine and ads business.” The company is investing more heavily in AI to develop privacy tools as well as help advertisers serve more ""relevant and engaging"" ads, he said. Some of those efforts are already paying off, with conversions, or an advertiser’s desired outcome from ads, increasing 20% in the last quarter compared with the prior year. Meta also uses AI for their content algorithms.AI has already become “fundamental” to WPP Plc, the world’s largest advertising group by revenue, said CEO Mark Read, adding that it can help find relevant audiences and measure the impact of the company’s work.SearchMicrosoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella said there’s a “sea change” happening in search. The company’s AI model, Prometheus, will allow it to make the biggest leap ever in the relevance of results, he said. Its new Bing search engine adds the ability to chat and can help users compose emails and other content. Google will integrate the underlying technology in its Bard chatbot into its own engine. CEO Sundar Pichai has said this will produce results that “distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats.”TranslationZoom Video Communications Inc. CEO Eric Yuan pledged to “layer more AI technologies into our products,” and touted new features like translation, video captioning and analysis for sales.Medical devices, research and testingIn its own call, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. highlighted that it hired Taha Kass-Hout, former vice president of machine learning and chief medical officer at Amazon.com Inc. The General Electric Co. spinoff is counting on Kass-Hout to lead its push for growth through improved machine-learning capabilities while it raises investment in digital services and software.One AI application the company specifically mentioned during its call with investors is an algorithm it offers to radiologists to help produce sharper images quicker. CEO Peter Arduini said the product has already reduced scan times for about 5.5 million patients globally. Another is a cardiac ultrasound product that uses AI to help assess heart muscle function.Medtronic Plc found its AI-assisted spinal surgery planning makes workflows “faster and more efficient,” CEO Geoffrey Martha said. The company’s adoption of AI to help physicians detect polyps in colonoscopies led to its gastrointestinal business growing in the ""high single-digits.""Charles River Laboratories International Inc. sees AI helping drug discovery, potentially by indicating whether a new drug will be as effective as an old one, said CEO James Foster.Medical testing center operator Quest Diagnostics Inc. said that it has begun using a highly automated microbiology lab system that leverages AI to analyze samples. CEO Jim Davis mentioned the platform in the company's earnings call when he was talking about ways in which it's trying to counter “significant inflation and wage pressures.”CybersecurityPalo Alto Networks Inc. CEO Nikesh Arora said the company has been using AI in its security services to prevent cyberattacks, and has done about $30 million in sales of its product that uses machine learning to detect threats.Product procurement, inventory and analysisFast food chain owner Yum! Brands Inc. uses AI to predict and recommend how much product restaurant managers should order each week for 3,000 of its U.S. Taco Bell and KFC locations. The aim is to reduce waste and transfers of inventory between stores. The company is working on a process to predict the quantity and time food should be cooked primarily in KFC restaurants, planning to pilot it in an international market.Home-improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. has given staff phones to compress dozens of systems into a simplified workflow and improve customer service, and the devices now include “Sidekick,” an app that uses machine learning to help employees prioritize tasks and know when inventory on shelves is running low.Tapestry Inc., owner of luxury brands like Coach and Kate Spade, highlighted new capabilities to use AI to forecast customer demand and curate its inventory. The analysis “helped to ensure our product was in the right place at the right time,” said CEO Joanne Crevoiserat.Caterpillar Inc., one the world's largest manufacturers of construction and mining equipment, is “investing heavily in AI,” CEO Jim Umpleby said. The company has for years been digitizing everything from bulldozers to diggers to get early alerts of problems and keep them from breaking down. Its system uses AI to better anticipate when a machine may break, and in some cases may automatically alert a dealer to provide a new part.Matching servicesAirbnb Inc. CEO Brian Chesky said AI can help the home-sharing company deal with the challenge of matching travelers to hosts when, unlike rooms in a hotel, every listing is unique. “If there's like 50,000 homes in a city, what's the right one for you?” he said. “That's less of a search problem than a matching problem, and I think that AI is going to be a really great opportunity for us.”Match Group Inc. CEO Bernard Kim said one way the company’s Tinder dating app “can really change the game is by leveraging machine learning to enhance recommendations.” The group already uses machine learning for safety and moderation, and its plan this year to expand its proficiency in the area will get a boost from its purchase of South Korea’s Hyperconnect, which brought with it a team with expertise in the area, he said.Hiring and talent acquisitionAt human resources consultant Robert Half International Inc., which has more than 30 million candidates in its database, Chief Financial Officer Michael Buckley said spending on AI will be “flattish” this year compared to 2022. AI has “transformed how we identify and select candidates,” and the company is working on how AI can identify leads for its sales professionals.Customer serviceWells Fargo &amp; Co. will start rolling out to customers an AI-powered virtual assistant called “Fargo” to personalize and simplify people’s banking experience, said CEO Charlie Scharf.CME Group Inc. agreed to a 10-year partnership with Google Cloud in 2021, using its data analytics and machine learning solutions to help CME provide clients with information and toolkits for developing models, algorithms and risk management, it said at the time. CEO Terrence Duffy said in early February the derivatives exchange operator doesn’t necessarily have to shell out to deliver AI for customers, as “we're able to get that through Google without having to make the investment ourselves.”VeriSign Inc., which provides domain registry services, said ChatGPT may enhance its NameStudio tool, which suggests alternatives if the name a consumer tries to register is already taken, said CEO Jim Bidzos.It's clear that not every company has embraced the AI hype with the same enthusiasm as the ones above. For every major company that mentioned AI in an earnings call this quarter, there were scores more that didn’t utter the phrase at all.Some companies, namely financial ones, have gone as far as to ban or restrict their employees' use of ChatGPT in particular. Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among those that have recently banned employees from using the chatbot.The clamor for everything AI bears hallmarks of the cryptocurrency frenzy that took Wall Street by storm a few years back, and more recently the metaverse. Only time will tell if investor interest will last longer than it did for those similarly untested concepts.For his part Matthew Kanterman, director of research at Roundhill Investments, sees some big differences between AI and other more short-lived bets.The returns from AI are “more tangible, more real,” he said. It's “happening right now.”--With assistance from Paul Jarvis, Julia Love, Brody Ford, Dina Bass, Kurt Wagner and Joe Deaux.(Updates Nasdaq 100’s performance this year in the fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYellowstone Backers Wanted to Cash Out—Then the Streaming Bubble BurstFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the ExitsFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB SecretsThe Debt Ceiling Is the Risk Wall Street Doesn’t Want to Think AboutWith Gucci and Balenciaga Struggling, Kering Aims for a Reset©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the World. When it comes to high technology, the aircraft industry ranks right at the top of the food chain, alongside semiconductor fabrication and astronautics. The modern day jet aircraft - whether civilian or military - has hundreds of thousands of parts which are often shipped from all over the world for final assembly into the beast that takes to the skies.Naturally, this amount of complexity makes for high barriers to entry into the industry and leaves only a handful of firms that are able to make and sell airplanes. Due to their size, jets also take months to assemble and end up costing millions of dollars. This high cost also makes the aircraft manufacturing industry one of the most lucrative in the world - and one which sees little threat from new entrants. For instance, a research report from Polaris Market Research outlines that the aircraft manufacturing market was worth $413 billion in 2021 and that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.7% between then and 2030 to be worth an estimated $626 billion by the end of the forecast period.As is the case with nearly every high tech industry, perhaps except semiconductors, Polaris Market Research also highlights that North America was the largest aircraft manufacturing market in 2021 with a large demand for next generation airplanes fueling the growth. However, despite being the largest, North America will not be the fastest growing sector, as this title will go to Asia Pacific which is fueled by the growing populations of India and China spurring demand and increasing the need for planes to fly people around.The aircraft industry is also evolving, with new manufacturing and computing technologies providing companies the opportunity to improve their operations. One interesting innovation that has made its way to the manufacturing line is the use of smart glasses. These are eyewear that comes equipped with digital displays and provides the assembly technician useful inputs throughout their activities. For instance, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which is one of the world's largest aircraft manufacturers, has found that using these wearables in its wire harness assembly has enabled it to reduce production time by a massive 25%. Boeing is not the only one that uses smart glasses in the aircraft supply chain. One of the world's most advanced jet engine manufacturers, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), has been researching their use since 2017 and found that not only did the mechanics who are responsible for tightening nuts on fuel lines see their productivity improve by 8% due to smart glasses but that 85% of those surveyed said that they reduced errors and 60% preferred using the wearables.Story continuesAnother trend in the industry is the push towards sustainable aviation fuels since air travel is among the leading sources of carbon dioxide emissions. On this front, Boeing announced in February 2023 that it plans to procure 5.6 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel for its 2023 flight operations, more than doubling last year's procurement and accounting for a quarter of the aerospace giant's total fuel needs. Not to be left behind, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is looking at the future as it is designing aircraft that reduce fuel use through their airframe. NASA's Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project aims to invest $425 million with Boeing over seven years as part of the White House's Climate Action Plan.At the same time, demand for conventional aviation is also booming, with Boeing's chief executive officer (CEO) Mr. Matt Welch sharing an update during the firm's fourth quarter of 2022 earnings call held in January 2023. Mr. Welch sounded optimistic about his company's future, sharing that demand was strong across Boeing's portfolio, as he explained that:On the order front and on the market side, we continue to see very strong demand across the portfolio. More than 800 net orders on the year, driven by the 737 MAX and the 787, highlighted most recently by the very historic deal with UAL, United Airlines in December. In 2022, we sold 200-plus net wide bodies. That’s the most since 2018. More broadly, the 737 MAX team has made tremendous progress. Fleet is performing exceptionally well. Production is stabilizing, demand is strong. We delivered 1,000-plus 737 MAXs in total now. And since our return to service, the fleet has surpassed 3 million flight hours. It’s safe and it’s the most reliable of the airplane fleets. Production, we’ve all gone from 0 to 31 a month and we’re prioritizing stability, which we have not yet achieved, but we’re on a steady course to do so.And orders, more than 1,500 gross orders to date. 737 MAX returning to service in China is another indication of this overall improvement in our business. This month, of course, we all know that, that occurred. We have more airplanes on the Tarmac in China to bring back into service just as we did here in the U.S. before we began any deliveries of any sort.The Boeing chief also shared the cheer flowing through his as NASA launched the SLS rocket (built by Boeing) to the Moon last year, and stated:Our SLS launch. This was an enormous emotional upper for our company and for our team broadly. The Artemis 1 launch in November, which was powered by the SLS rocket was more than a little inspiring.Today, we'll look at some of the biggest aircraft manufacturing companies in the world. One of these, unsurprisingly, is Boeing, while the others include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China.15 Biggest Airplane Manufacturing Companies in the WorldOur Methodology As a starting point for our list, we first listed all publicly traded companies that make planes and selected them through market capitalization.

To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?Story continuesSusan Patricia GriffithGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was among the toughest years of Progressive's 85 years. The continued effects of the pandemic, high inflation and the largest hurricane in our history all played a role in a tumultuous environment. Throughout these challenges, Progressive people came together in unity and delivered once again beating our goal of a calendar year '96 combined ratio while growing both written premiums and policies in force.The pride that I feel in all of the people of Progressive is indescribable. We have met all challenges head-on and continue to deliver the best-in-class results our stakeholders expect. Our ability to meet these challenges is embedded in our culture, which is built on our newly updated 4 cornerstones: which are who we are, which is our core values, why we are here, which is our purpose. We revised our purpose to be, we exist to help people move forward and live fully.Our modified purpose builds on the legacy of our core values and our history of challenging the status quo to accelerate progress and equity. We modified the purpose to better unify and guide our organization.Where we are headed, which is our vision. We expanded our vision to include business owners, so it now provides a more holistic view of all the customers we are privileged to serve. And how we will get there. which is the 4 pillars of our strategy. We've updated these 2 cornerstones to better reflect the evolution of our company and to ensure our culture adapt to the ever-changing environment we operate in. While our business will continue to progress, we will always seek to maintain the things that make Progressive progressive.In today's call, we once again focus on the strategy cornerstone and specifically, we'll discuss the pillar of competitive prices. Competitive prices means not just offering the best rate, but also the most accurate rate driven by pricing accuracy, expense discipline and industry-leading segmentation.As we have said for the last few quarters, we believe the major Personal Auto rate increases are likely behind us. In the fourth quarter, we continued to raise Personal Auto rates but at a pace slower than in late 2021 and early 2022. While some states are still waiting on filings to be approved by their respective regulators, we believe the majority of states are nearing rate adequacy, and our intent is to continue to increase rates commensurate with future loss trends.Based on public rate filings, we know that our competitors are raising rates to address their own profitability concerns. And as they have done so, we've seen our relative competitiveness improve, which has resulted in improving retention strong quote growth and high conversion.We've now actually seen some competitors surpass our post-COVID rate take, which should help us sustain those improvement trends. As a result, we finished 2022 with the best fourth quarter for Personal Auto new application volume in our history, which contributed to growing our Personal Auto PIFs 3% in 2022 and while also running a lower acquisition expense ratio than 2021. We're continuously evaluating our media budget, and we'll continue to use media efficiently as we enter 2023, and we will look to capitalize on this hard market.The higher direct acquisition expense ratio in January is indicative of our opportunistic stance, and it reflects the confidence we have of current rate levels in most states at this time. Of course, if the last 3 years have taught us anything, it's that the future is unpredictable. So we will continue to monitor the business carefully and navigate its data to grow as fast as possible while delivering a calendar year '96 combined ratio.As I said in my annual shareholder's letter, segmentation is a key facet of our competitive prices, and nowhere is that more evident than in our investment in usage-based insurance products, which will be the topic of today's presentation. Progressive was a first mover in usage-based insurance. We have had a UBI offering since 1996 when we launched our first product called Autograph. This first effort was limited by the technology at the time and required a professional mechanic to install equipment in a customer's car at a considerable expense.That first attempt evolved to TripSense in 2004, which was our first self-install option. And then in 2008, we launched MyRate, which is where we first employed cellular technology to upload data to our systems. And then in 2010, we launched Snapshot, which we consider the start of modern UBI program. We moved from our discount-only model to one that included the possibility of a surcharge in 2014. And in 2016 launched a Snapshot app, which allowed the customer to use a mobile phone app instead of the plug-in device. Our most recent addition is Continuous monitoring, which began its rollout in the summer of 2022.In parallel to our efforts in Personal Lines, we were developing UBI for commercial auto products. This culminated in our first broad commercial offering, Smart Haul, in 2018, which allows us to provide usage-based insurance to truckers in partnership with providers in electronic volume devices. We also expanded the Snapshot program for commercial auto with Snapshot ProView in 2020, which includes fleet monitoring services to small businesses.Throughout our history of usage-based insurance, we have collected billions of miles of data and invested in a process of continuous improvement in our UBI products. Today, UBI is our most predictive rating variable and it provides unparalleled rate accuracy to our customers. Through this, we've continuously educated our customers were today, UBI adoption is at near historical highs.To highlight our UBI products on this call, we've invited two Progressive leaders who have made significant roles in our UBI development. First to speak will be Jim Haas, business leader for our Personal Auto usage-based insurance. Jim is a 20-year progressive veteran. And for the last 5 years, he has led our Personal Auto UBI team. Jim will discuss the advances we have made in Personal Auto UBI. Following Jim will be Cory Fischer. Cory is a 19-year Progressive veteran. For 9 years, Cory has been our business leader for Commercial Lines R&amp;D. And as of last month, Cory accepted a new role to lead our agency distribution group. During his tenure in commercial lines, Cory led R&amp;D during the successful rollout of both our Commercial Auto UBI products. Cory will be highlighting all of the advances we have made in Commercial Lines UBI, once again giving progressive first-mover advantage in this important technology.Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I will now hand it over to Jim Haas. Jim?Jim HaasThank you, Tricia. As Tricia mentioned, my name is Jim Haas, and I lead Progressive's Personal Lines telematics efforts. Today, I'd like to tell you about how we've built on that long history in telematics that Tricia discussed. Starting with how we've continued to improve our core Snapshot program, then moving on to discuss how we can now bring in data from outside sources to improve rating accuracy during the new business quote. And finally, wrapping up with the discussion of some value-added services we'll be bringing to market soon.First, let's recap how our program has worked for a number of years. Individual states may vary a bit, but I'll describe here how it works in most places. We or the agent present the customer with the offer to enroll a Snapshot during their initial quote. If the customer elects to sign up, they'll receive an immediate discount of up to 10% for participating in Snapshot, that will be applied to that quote. So long as the customer stays in Snapshot, that discount stays on the policy during the whole first term.During the quote, the customer also elects whether they want to monitor using a plug-in OBD 2 device that we send them or via an app on smartphone. The customer then has 45 days to plug in the device or get the app set up. That point, all they need to do is drive, we'll let them know how they're doing along the way. Just before their policy comes up for renewal, we'll use the driving data collected during that first term to calculate the renewal discount or surcharge. That rate adjustment will be included in the renewal quote and will be applied to future policy terms. At that point, the customer can delete the app or send us back to device and they'll be done monitoring.I'd mentioned that the rate could go down or it could go up, that is we would apply a discount or a surcharge. But that's not how our program started. In the early days, the program is structured a little bit differently, but a customer's rate couldn't get worse by participating in Snapshot. Customers could receive a discount of up to 30%, but the rate couldn't go up no matter how risky they're driving looked. Many companies still employ a model like this today.Of course, no rating variable in insurance only suggests giving discounts. It's about segmentation and matching rate to risk. So the data would suggest that some customers should see the rate increase while others should see a decrease. While only offering discounts might encourage more people to participate in the program makes the economics a lot more challenging and limits the accuracy of the overall pricing. We all know that pricing accuracy is critical in auto insurance.So starting in late 2014, we began introducing a surcharge. We set our factors so that about 1/5 of customers received a surcharge, a share that we've kept about the same over time. The surcharge was small at first, but start us on the path to greater accuracy. It's also when we introduced the participation discount, which is down 10% in most states.Over time, we've moved the price closer and closer to what the data would tell us. First, by increasing the maximum surcharge from 10% to 15%, then increasing it to 20%. And finally, to where we are today. We offer larger discounts than we did in the past, now of up to 30%. But we also have larger potential surcharges than in the past 2, now up to 40%. We've come a long way since the days of only offering a discount, but it's important to note that about 75% of customers still receive a discount and only about 1/5 received a surcharge.Not surprisingly, we see better retention on customers who earn a discount and worse retention on those were in a surcharge. Renewal rates for the safest drivers who are earning the biggest discounts are about 6% higher than average while they're about 16% lower for the riskiest drivers who aren't receiving a discount.So the program systematically helps us retain lower risk drivers and shed higher risk ones. And because of the changes we made to our Snapshot pricing over the years, we're more accurately priced than ever before on those customers that do stay with us. While these changes have certainly improved the accuracy of our pricing, there is still a limitation to our approach. We only use data from a single term, typically 4 to 5 months to set the price for the life of the policy. This made it so we wouldn't know about material changes in an individual's driving behavior would lead to less accuracy over time.We had experimented with a continuous program a long time ago, back in the late 2000s. At the time, though, consumer acceptance of telematics generally was still growing and collecting data on an ongoing basis was quite expensive. So we decided to move forward with a partial model. Things have changed a lot since then and in early 2022, we started migrating to a continuous version of Snapshot. The basic process isn't all that different. Customers still choose whether and how to participate in Snapshot during the quote and they still receive a participation discount. They still have 45 days to plug in the device or set up the app and then they can just drive.The difference comes after the renewal. As instead of sending the device back or deleting the app, we ask them to continue to monitor and we'll adjust their rate at each renewal to reflect their more recent driving. Additionally, that participation discount is larger now at 15% instead of 10%, which encourages more people to participate in the program.Having more recent data also improves the predictive power of UBI, which means we can price even more aggressively. We've increased the size of the maximum potential discount to 45% and the maximum potential surcharge to 60%. We're one of the few companies to combine a continuous model with the possibility of surcharges. As of the end of 2022, we had deployed this new continuous model in 12 states, representing over 1/4 of our net written premium and plan to roll out to most of the rest of the country during 2023.So while we've been steepening these factors and requiring longer monitoring to make our pricing even more accurate, what's happened to take rate? The answer is that the share of our Personal Auto customers participating in Snapshot has moved steadily upward. In fact, it's up nearly 40% across both channels combined since January of 2019. So today, more people participate in Snapshot than ever before, providing data for longer periods of time that we can use to price more accurately than ever before.So that's the update on what's been going on with our core Snapshot program, which provides great incremental segmentation over what is available via attritional rating variables on renewal policy terms.Now I want to talk about how we're working to bring this pricing accuracy to where it's most useful at the time of the new business quote. Since in this scenario, the customer is only now just coming to us, we'll have to use telematics data that was collected by others. Our long telematics experience has helped us learn how to use this data and how to make it predictive. We currently have 2 initiatives in market. The first is a lead generation program that works by inviting good drivers to come and quote with us. While the other begins when a customer comes to Progressive directly to get a quote, and we find and incorporate driving data from third parties into the right we present them.Let me start with the lead generation program. Here, a partner like Credit Karma, invites their customer to opt into collecting driving data to see if they could save money on their car insurance. In a privacy-friendly way where we don't receive personally identifiable information, we can let Credit Karma know who's likely to receive a discount so they can invite them to quote with us. Only when the customer chooses to quote, are we able to personally identify that data and are then able to apply that discount to that individual's quote, improving pricing accuracy immediately.Our second program involves working with data collected by automakers. Over the last several years, more and more of them have been equipping their vehicles with technology to collect driving data. They've been working to show the value of these programs to their customers so that they'll sign up to share that data with them. And we've been able to tap into that. When a customer comes to us to quote and their driving data is available, we'd ask the customer if they like us to use it to determine their price. They say, yes, we bring that data in and apply the UBI discount or surcharge to their quote immediately. Again, pushing that rate accuracy to where it matters most, the new business quote.Because of our long experience with UBI and in working with both OBD and mobile data and the fact that we attract so many insurance shoppers every year, we're well positioned to execute and benefit from this. To be clear, automakers are in various, often early, stages of getting the necessary equipment into their cars and making this data available to insurers. Additionally, just because new cars coming off the assembly that have the hardware, it takes a long time for the fleet to turn over.So this isn't common yet, but we're excited about the opportunity it represents. We're already working with 2 of the largest automakers, General Motors and Toyota and it's clear that this population will grow over the coming years.Lastly, I'd like to share some exciting news that doesn't involve using telematics data to more accurately rate policies but instead, builds upon our telematics heritage to provide a valuable service to our customers. Over the last couple of years, we've experimented with offering a service to detect and respond to major accidents to some of our Snapshot customers to learn if they value the service and to better understand how it could be useful in handling claims. We've been encouraged on both fronts as customers have consistently told us that this kind of service is something that they really do value and our claims representatives have seen a telematics data can help them settle claims more quickly and efficiently.So we know that despite how times have changed, there is a large segment of customers who don't want their insurance premium to be based on their driving data. That means that if we limit this just to our Snapshot customers, we'd be leaving out a lot of others. So in March, we plan to start making accident response available to all of our auto customers, not just those who were in Snapshot. We'll use data from the sensors on the phone to detect when a serious crash is likely to have happened. We'll reach out to the customer to confirm the accident and to see if they need help.If we don't hear from a customer at all, and it seems particularly serious, we'll request that the police conduct a well check to make sure our customer is okay. Since we know the customer's location from the telematics data, we know just where to send them.We know there are other accident response services available. We think what we're offering has several key benefits, though, that distinguish it. First, many services come at an additional monthly expense. Ours will come included in the policy. There is no additional charge. This adds value to the customer's relationship with us and can become another reason to choose and to stay with Progressive.Additionally, while other insurers offer crash detection to their UBI customers, we'll be making it available to all of our Personal Lines auto customers, whether they're in Snapshot or not.Third, we're deliberate about dispatching EMS. We certainly wanted to get EMS dispatch as quickly as we can when a customer needs it. But we also don't want to waste EMS resources and bother the customer when they don't. This can be challenging since the sensor data for a near miss and an actual accident can look awfully similar. So we try to contact the customer more than once using different methods so they can let us know if there was an accident and if they need help.We only send help if the customers has requested or if we haven't been able to reach them after several tries and the accident looks severe. While most customers in these accidents don't actually need ambulance, many do need a tow truck. We're able to build on our roadside assistance experience to meet this need. We understand that if these tows are even more urgent than a typical roadside request, we can also help customers notify their family members.Lastly, after an accident, one of consumers' top concerns is how to get their medical bills paid and how to get their car back on the road. As their insurer, we're the ones positioned to help them get there. By detecting these accidents and having this telematics data available. We're able to get their claim started more quickly and able to handle is more efficiently. In fact, if an ambulance or tow is dispatched, we'll actually get their claim started on their behalf. Let me show you an example. This is a real claim that was detected via accident response. In the loss pictured here, our customer was driving on an urban boulevard when they hit some ice, lost control of the vehicle, first striking barricade to their left before striking the barricade on the right. Fortunately, no other vehicles we're involved. As you can see, the airbags deployed and there was pretty severe damage to the front of our insured vehicle. In fact, this vehicle is a total loss. Additionally, our customer and two of their passengers were injured in the crash. Within 2 minutes of the impact, we reached out to our customer. While they didn't respond to our initial push notification, they did respond to a subsequent call from a live agent, which occurred less than 5 minutes after the accident. That agent dispatched an ambulance and tow truck to the scene. Only a few minutes later, the claim was filed. Altogether, it took only 10 minutes from the time of the accident to when we had a claim in our system.We've surveyed some of our accident response customers, where we've gotten has some great feedback. For instance, this customer showed that they were ""unable to call for help at the time but help called me"". This service helps us help our customers when they need it most. It's not just the immediate response to the accident that can help customers though. Here's another example. This customer collided with another vehicle when changing lanes. We detected this accident as well, dispatched the tow for them and have the claim filed within 12 minutes of the accident. What I want to highlight in this case, though, is that this customer had this accident just 2 days after buying their policy. Some of the first steps in handling any claim include establishing the facts of loss and determining if the loss is covered.Unfortunately, there are people who buy insurance after they had an accident and then try to make a claim for it. This means that honest customers are inconvenienced as we need to take the time to verify that the accident happened when they told us it did. That was pretty easy in this case, however, since we detected the accident in the first place and arrange for the tow truck to pick up the car. And we can see from the telematics data that the crash happened where . and importantly when our customers said it did. Therefore, we were very confident that this loss did occur after and not before the customer purchased the policy, which let us move forward more quickly with getting the customer back on the road.So it's not just the accident response service self, but its promise to improve the claims experience that can benefit our customers. They've told us they value accident response, and we're excited to make it available to them. We'll start that process in March and expect to make it available to all of our Personal Auto customers over the next year or so.To wrap up, we're not just jumping on the telematics bandwagon. We have decades of experience here. We're clear-eyed about the challenges but also see the great opportunities telematics offerings present. But this is just this is just the Personal Line side of the story. My colleagues in Commercial Lines have been developing their own approach about how to use telematics data in their markets.And Cory Fischer, who's led Commercial Lines R&amp;D for the better part of the last 10 years is here to tell us about it. Cory?Cory FischerThanks, Jim. As Tricia shared, I'm Cory Fischer, and up until recently, I was the business leader for Commercial Lines product research and development, which includes responsibility for commercial telematics efforts. Today, I'd like to share the progress we've made since introducing our commercial telematics programs, some early observations and how we're thinking about future investments in this space. The chart on the lower left was shared in a prior Investor Relations call. It's why we're excited and have been investing in telematics. Pricing segmentation is an important part of how we compete. The group I've worked with is charged with advancing our Commercial Auto segmentation leadership position in the market. Telematics is the most predictive rating variable we have by a lot.To build on that segmentation leadership position, we need to be a leader in telematics. For context, we have 2 branded telematics programs. Smart Haul is the first program we introduced in 2018 after several years of data collection studies and pilots. It targets truckers that are required to maintain hours of service logs. The launch intentionally coincided with the federal mandate requiring these truckers to move from paper logbooks to electronic logging devices. We recognized those devices provide continuous monitoring and capture very similar data to our snapshot devices, including location information. With the customer's consent, we use the data from the truckers electronic logging device to generate a score and apply a rating factor.Ideally, we access the data during the core process, just like the process Jim discussed using data to price new business. If we're not able to get the data, either they are newer venture without driving history, or we don't have immediate access to their ELD vendor. We provide a participation discount on the quote. Snapshot ProView, on the right, is more similar to what Progressive Personal Auto has offered. Its target is essentially anyone that doesn't have an electronic logging device. We market snapshot ProView as safety and savings. For customers that enroll, we provide a participation discount at new business and send a Snapshot device that they can easily plug in. Given how small businesses have employee turnover, this program has continuous monitoring. We'll then use the driving data to generate a score in a factor that applied at renewal. This factor could be a discount or a surcharge.In addition, we provide access to a free driver portal. Our customer can see where their vehicles are and how they're being driven. It's a fairly simple way to keep tabs on their fleet and driving behavior. Since we deployed these programs, we've been monitoring a number of key metrics. The chart on the right shows a version of take rate. That is percentage of new business apps and rolling into a telematics program. We've seen from prior program launches, it can take a while and require a sustained effort to get meaningful adoption. Though we've identified opportunities for increasing take rate, we're genuinely happy with how quickly adoption has occurred and the trajectory it's on.In addition to adoption, we've seen that when quoters enroll into a program, they convert at a higher rate than the cohort that's eligible but chooses not to enroll. We also see that our telematics book of business performs better from a profitability standpoint, even after the discount is applied. That's not the longer-term goal. Our intent is to accurately price all segments of target.Between our significant footprint in the Commercial Auto market, healthy adoption rate and conversion lift, we've built a substantial Commercial Auto telematics book of business. That book would be a top 15 commercial auto insurance carrier on its own.In summary, we're really pleased with the growth and performance of our telematics efforts. But we've learned a lot since introducing these programs. One recognition, getting into telematics is not easy. It's not just as simple as adding a new rating variable. It takes broader and sustained effort, new capabilities and investments.For example, we're asking our partners in the independent agent channel to take additional steps to enroll customers, which can include a supplemental app and working through customer reservations with sharing their driving data. That requires an incremental level of support and training.With telematics, we're now dealing with hardware and data transmission. Were also in the logistics business, sending out devices, tracking inventory levels and recently, dealing with global supply chain issues. That's a different set of vendors, technical challenges, systems and business processes that we've had to work through.I think the biggest difference is the amount of data that these devices generate. We have to ensure that data is being managed effectively. It's imperative as the data is being transmitted and stored that it's handled securely. Also, as the largest commercial auto insurer in the United States, we have a lot of data and have developed effective tools, processes and skills to manage and model those more traditional data sets.Telematics is an entirely different situation. One truck alone might generate over 1 million records per year. Our traditional approaches aren't nearly as effective performing big data sets into variables that we can test and model off of. A big advantage to us is that Personal Auto through its efforts and investments over the past 20-some years has established a lot of these capabilities or learnings that we can leverage.For example, our Snapshot ProView program uses the Personal Auto Snapshot device. Given the Volume that Personal Auto has generated, we have a very competitive cost per device, and that device is already set up to transmit the data back to our secure storage solutions.In terms of big data, Personal Auto helped us move to their cloud solution, essentially a highly scalable, cloud-based data storage and analysis service. This significantly reduces our processing time to analyze data and at a much lower cost than traditional alternatives. They've also provided support as we upskill our team to use these new tools. To summarize this slide, getting into telematics requires a lot of effort. A competitive advantage that we have in Commercial Lines is that our colleagues and Jim's group have already laid a lot of that groundwork that we can either use or learn from. It takes a lot to stand up a leading telematics program and to maintain that leadership takes ongoing investment.I'll share some of those ideas with this slide. Near term, there's a lot that we can do to improve the experience. We have data that shows where customers drop out of the funnel or hit operational hurdles by granting data-sharing consent or installing the plug-in device. We have worked with our vendors and have new business processes that will improve both. We have several manual processes in place that support these programs. By automating those, we will lower our program expenses and improve the customer or agent experience. There are a few segments that are currently eligible for one of these programs. We're looking to expand eligibility.One example is for our small fleet customers that have their own telematics service, but not electronic logging devices. This could be a service fleet like plumbing. Our intent is to enroll them into a program and access the data from their telematics service provider. Through these near-term plans, we'll continue to grow our telematics book and with that additional data continue to refine and improve our scoring models.We're also excited about new data sources and applications. We're seeing better reception from segments that we target to having dashcams. We've been doing a pilot with dashcams for over a year. There's data from video that we don't capture today like following distance, which could be valuable. And as Jim shared, we're interested in how telematics can help with the claims process. Dashcams would be an additional input that could be meaningful for claims.We're also using the data to support our underwriting efforts. For now, that might mean verifying other information on the application like radius of operations or garaging ZIP Code, which are important for us to assess where the vehicle is operated. Sometimes, we need to follow up to confirm that the information on the application is correct.We can use telematics data to better target which risks we should follow up on. Our telematics score is currently bolted on to our core model. Given not everyone is in a telematics program, we solve our core model first and then add a telematics score factor for those enrolled. Over time, we plan to move more of the telematics data into the core product, especially where we have those insights at time of quote. Here's an example. This shows on trucks driving pattern for 60 days. On the application, the insurance address and garaging Zip is Elizabeth, New Jersey, and they've listed their operating radius as 25 miles. Our model would use information closest to that address to determine a territory factor. Some customers had a garage there might never go into New York City. This truck goes lots of different places, but it turns out there's a fairly regular pattern of going into the city. It's hard to tell from this map. But from the data, let's say, 75% of the trips go from Elizabeth into New York City before turning around. A territory factor that puts more weight on the New York City experience would be more suitable. Part of our roadmap is to integrate telematics deeper into our model. I don't see a time we have a telematics-only model. We know we get valuable segmentation from non-telematics variables, but there are variables like garaging address and radius, that proxy driving location and where the actual telematics data would be a superior solution. Wrapping up, we've got a great start to our telematics journey. We've got a significant benefit from the experience and investments our colleagues in personal auto have made, and I'm really excited about how we'll continue to use telematics to drive competitive advantage going forward.Douglas S. ConstantineThis concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Jim Haas and Cory Fischer, who can answer questions about the UBI presentation. The Q&amp;A session will be audio only (Operator Instructions) We will now take our first question. Stacy?Question and Answer SessionOperatorOur first question for today comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Michael, go ahead with your questions.Michael David ZaremskiA first question, Progressive's Personal Auto accident frequency levels appear to be trending a lot better than the industry over the past year. I'm curious if you agree with that statement and if you do, any thoughts on what's causing the better-than-historical average trend line? I know clearly, a lot of this call was devoted to segmentation. Progressive is a first mover in -- or one of the first movers in telematics. So that theoretically should, I guess, improve Progressive's trend line versus the industry, if I'm thinking about things correctly, too, but I would love to hear more about that.Susan Patricia GriffithYes, Mike, I think you're thinking about it in the right way. A couple of caveats when we report frequency, we report incurred and a lot of our competitors report paid. But we've been seeing this trend more negative in the industry for a while. We can't speculate on a lot of things. Obviously, segmentation is a big piece, we believe. We also believe that mix of business could play a role and that could be mix in states or mix overall from a preferred perspective, we talked in the fourth quarter and in my letter about growth across all of our segments that we started to see increase in Q4.We have seen growth again across all segments, but higher in the Diane, Wrights and Robinsons. Again, we still see it in Sams was higher. So it could be mix as well. The good news is that we see this data change quickly. So if we need to change anything we're doing from a pricing perspective, we'll see it pretty quickly.John Peter SauerlandI had a couple on to that. So I think Jim Haas's slide, where he showed the retention of customers who are getting a surcharge versus a discount is a great case in point of segmentation at work. So the folks who are getting a surcharge equally are going to be the higher frequency drivers and the folks who are getting a discount on the lower frequency. And obviously, in the marketplace, as that continues to play out, that will help drive our frequency more favorable than our competitors. Additionally, we've talked about underwriting efforts we put in place as we were challenged by profitability. We've raised rates considerably as we've shared. I will note that we have retained our underwriting restrictions fairly tight. So we've been able to manage that in this very competitive environment to a point where we're able to maintain the underwriting restrictions, which, generally speaking, are pushing off the higher frequency customers and able to raise rates at the same time.So I think we're in a pretty good place, both from the rate level perspective, but also continuing to guard against segments that might be underpriced.Michael David ZaremskiGot it. That's helpful. And my follow-up is regarding some of the commentary you made about the automakers. I know we appreciate that you're not an automaker and you're partnering with them and it's in the early stages. But I believe you used the word excited about the partnership. And I believe a lot of investors have felt that the automakers could represent a new leg or a new kind of leg of competitiveness within the industry. So curious if you're having to -- maybe you could shed more light on the partnerships and ultimately, if Progressive is having to pay the automakers for this data, why isn't a bit of a competitive threat as well?Susan Patricia GriffithYes. Sure. Mike. I'll let Jim Haas talk a little bit more about that. But we think competition across the board, whether it's with the OEs or with insurtech is great. And we also feel like when we have partnerships, like Jim talked about, it's really important and it benefits most importantly, the consumers. So Jim, do you want to add any color to that?Jim HaasSure. Mike, you're right. We obviously pay for the data eventually goes to the automakers. It's a way for them to monetize that. They're putting all this hardware in the car, that costs money. This is a way for them to get some return on that. Some OEMs are going to want to get an insurance as we've seen some might not. And so this is a different way for them to get value out of that data from us.OperatorOur next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.David Kenneth MotemadenTricia, I believe in August, you told us that you thought auto PIF growth in the next couple of years would be difficult to match the 70% type of PIF growth you guys saw in the 6 years since the start of the last hard market in 2016. Just wondering if we could get an update on your thoughts on that front, just given the challenges in the marketplace that some of your peers are seeing some of the losses they reported and just how you're feeling with your rates and what you're seeing on the new apps. Just wondering how you -- do you still feel that way just on the type of growth that you think we could see over the next 5 to 6 years?Susan Patricia GriffithThanks, David. I will tell you, I feel a lot more bullish than I felt about 4 or 5 months ago. We went through reacting to severity trends that frankly, we've never seen before. I can't predict what PIF growth will be because we -- there's a lot of environmental things going on. What I've learned over the last 3 years is to anticipate that there's going to be things that we haven't prepared for, whether it's the used car prices, inflation, frequency, driving behavior, pandemic. That said, I believe we're in a really great position as we sit.So we said we were going to start to take rate. I think we foreshadowed that late '21. It took some time into 2022 to obviously start to earn into the book. We do feel good, but we're always watching what's happening, and there's been kind of an ever-evolving changing. So on the private passenger auto side, as you know, we took 13.5 points last year. We still have about 3 points of that to earn in, in this calendar year. And just for some color, we took 1.5 points in January. So we continue to look at trends and the future trends and the rate need that we need now to match rate to risk. With that said, and John Sauerland added this on to the first question from Mike, and that is what we're in such a good position now because we have -- there's a lot of shopping out there, a lot of prospects out there because our competitors have been now raising rates, so they're catching up to and sometimes exceeding us, but we're in just a different position because we got out in front of it.So there's a lot of shopping -- a lot of ambient shopping, which is really efficient for us. And what happens with what both Jim and Cory talked about as well as other variables, we believe -- we have superior segmentation. So we're going to grab on to as many customers and obviously keep as many customers as we can for as long as we can. However, this time frame in this hard market last. And of course, that segmentation and the adverse selection flywheel works in our favor because of our many, many decades of investing in things like segmentation, competitive prices, our brand, et cetera.So while I can't foreshadow what our PIF growth is going to be, we are going to do everything we can to follow our long-standing goal of growing as fast as we possibly can at our '96 combined ratio and making sure we can take care of our customers.David Kenneth MotemadenOkay. Great. That's very helpful. And maybe just following up there. It sounds like the Continuous Monitoring, that's been an interesting development that I'm interested to hear what sort of impact that has had on underwriting profitability and growth in the 12 states where you've rolled it out? And how we should think about that as you roll it out on more states? Is that something where we can maybe see a step change in terms of profitability or frequency or anything from that perspective just -- on just greater segmentation that you might get from that?Susan Patricia GriffithI mean, I think from a cost perspective, obviously, Continuous is a little bit more expensive, but those costs have gone down over the years. But I think what we're excited about and what Jim talked about, the excitement about is the services that we're going to provide, especially in some of the claims example. So we will continue to evolve like we have since 1996 with our UBI products, and we believe that will continue to enhance our ability to out-segment our competitors. What that means from the exact amount, we don't know yet, but we'll continue to monitor. And I'm sure ever so often, we'll update you on where we're at with our UBI offerings.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs Alex.Alexander ScottFirst question I had was just on all the potential new business. Just looking at the application growth and so forth, how is -- how does sort of the growth penalty from new business coming on, look in this kind of environment, maybe during prior periods.Susan Patricia GriffithYes. I've been thinking about that a lot because in times where we have high growth, we often talk about the new business penalty. And as I'm thinking about it, penalties from my perspective are something that is done to you because maybe you did something wrong. As an example, Sunday, I was watching our youngest son, play lacrosse. He got a penalty for slashing. He knew it. He was emotional. He did, he took a [knee].We're a little bit different because the things that we do and the amount that we pay is all controllable, as you witnessed when we pulled back on media and did some other things to make sure we reached our '96. So from my perspective, what we are paying, so you'll -- you saw the increase in January in our expense ratio, specifically on the direct side because we front load our acquisition cost there. It's really an investment in our future. It's an investment for our owners, investment for our customers.So it's something that we're excited to do in terms of how we manage the business. And again, we have the caveats with our ceiling of an aggregate all business lines, '96 combined ratio. So it's hard to compare from the past where we'll go, but we know that this has been a really volatile environment, and we have the levers to pull back should we need to, and throttle forward should we need to. So I can't tell you the exact amount. I will tell you that we're pretty excited about the position we are in right now. And again, we're progressive. So we're never going to be cocky, and we're always going to be really paranoid, and we follow the data maniacally and talk about it all the time, but we are really excited about what we believe this hard market, however long it lasts brings.Alexander ScottGot it. That's helpful. Second question I have, maybe a little more applicable to the telematics. When I think through this and the pricing advantage that it gives you over some competitors that are not doing it to the same scale or maybe even just to the industry broadly, I appreciate you probably don't want to like quantify some of these things. But could you kind of talk to us about directionally, has that pricing advantage that it provides? Has it expanded because of some of the things you're doing or some of these things that you're doing just allowing sort of your pricing advantage to be maintained as others begin to do more on the telematics front, but not to the same degree? Or is it sort of diminishing as more competitors or just like more broadly adopting telematics. I guess just high level, if you could talk about that.Susan Patricia GriffithYes. I'll talk about at a high level and then Jim and Cory can weigh in for their perspective on businesses. But one, it takes a lot to get history of driving behavior and to continuously learn on that. So I think you have to have a head start, which is why we sort of did a primer on the history of where we've been. We were out ahead of it, obviously, nearly 3 decades ago. A couple of points, though. I think that -- and one that Jim made is, I think it's important to make sure that we're pricing rate of risk.So although customers are never happy when they get a surcharge, when they do and if they go somewhere else, again, that's adverse selection. So there's multiple pieces of not just the equals 1, but also what can happen from a competitive perspective. So to be able to have the UBI as well as our other segmentations to truly understand that rate to risk and what John talked about with our underwriting acumen is also an important piece. I think it's probably more important on the Commercial Lines side from the perspective of if I'm a good driver, and I drive a truck, can I save money on my insurance, which is a big cost in the Commercial Line. So I don't know if Jim and Cory, you want to add anything?Jim HaasOn the Personal Line side. Yes, there's certainly more activity in UBI than there was 10 years ago, let's say. We're just continuing to move our pricing forward, price more aggressively, take more advantage of that, regardless of what anybody else is doing. We want to price as accurately as we can and get as many people into that program as we can.Cory FischerAlex. So for Commercial Auto, we are the largest commercial auto insurer, and we're also #1 in truck. And I think with that, we have a lot more data than anyone else. And so we have -- we feel like a leadership position in segmentation. I think telematics extends that leadership position relative to the marketplace. So there are some companies that are investing in telematics. But I think between our size, the amount of data we have, we believe we're increasing the lead through telematics.John Peter SauerlandI would just add. So over the history of the personal auto evolution in telematics, early on, we weren't pricing to the full curve. So we understood that a lot of people should be receiving surcharges and some people should be receiving bigger discounts. Because we were at the forefront, and we're seeking consumer adoption, we didn't price to that full curve. I think we are now very close to or almost completely pricing to that curve with the data we have today. However, as Jim was sharing, we continue to advance the size, continue to pull additional data elements that can continue to have us leading the pack.So our segmentation game is never ending. We're always trying to continue to advance to find additional data to use that can keep us with a gap between us and the competition. And as Cory mentioned in the prepared comments with the slides, Commercial Lines is at an earlier stage, similar to where Personal Lines was. We still have a significant loss ratio benefit in aggregate for telematics and Commercial Lines, which means we have further pricing options that we can play as competitors come to market with their offerings.So I think we're in a great place from a telematics standpoint. We are not at all at the end of the journey. We're going to continue to evolve and continue to advance our competitive advantage when it comes to pricing and telematics.Susan Patricia GriffithI'll add one last thing just because I think this is a subtle nuance are really important. And Cory mentioned it a couple of times, when he's thinking about telematics in his role -- in his prior role in Commercial Lines, he's talking to Jim and their team. He referred to colleagues and learnings that they have this is really common and very specific when you think about our strategic pillars. One is our people and our culture. Our culture is to go back and forth, whether it's talent and rotational jobs, but understanding learnings from the first movers within the company. That is really key.And I think it's really different because many of us -- I think Lori Niederst, prior to her role when she was in CHRO, she shared many years ago, the amount of depth in our leadership ranks because we think it's really important for people to know many sides of the business. So although it's subtle and it's hard to measure the way our culture is and the way our leaders work and the sharing of ideas and successes and opportunities is really important, especially in something like telematics.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.Andrew Scott KligermanThanks a lot. Really helpful answer to that prior question. But I'd like to elaborate on it a bit. And just thinking about the fact that I don't know, maybe 80%, 90% percent plus of the insured Personal Lines population utilizes Cambridge Mobile Telematics, I understand that Progressive's data and analytics is incredibly robust, the segmentation, you talked about history and data use. But the competitors can see all that. So my question is this replicatable in a very fast fashion? What makes it so hard not to replicate given that you're all using a similar platform?Susan Patricia GriffithYes. I'll let Jim talk about that more. Similar platform doesn't mean we're all using the same data or the same models or using the data in the same way. So one is, it's expensive to get into this. Over these last 3 years, we've invested a lot. So you just can't all of a sudden turn on, understand your data, early on, it's different. In urban and rural, it's different with your other segmentation variables. But Cambridge is the platform but we're not all sharing the same data and outputting the same exact thing.Jim, do you want to add anything?Jim HaasSure. You're right. Cambridge Mobile is our partner. We've had a great relationship with them. They provide the data collection mechanism that gets embedded in the app. And so we do get that data from them. And you're right, most people use them in the industry. I think what's different is we own our own algorithm. We use that data the way we want to, and we've learned a lot over the years about how to make the most out of that data.And I think you mentioned like everybody can see that. That's not actually true. Most -- in the entire industry, most algorithms for UBI are filed confidentially in the states. So those are not shared with all of the competitors. So we can't see in other companies algorithms, I can't see ours. So we think we can -- we've developed an advantage there, and we can maintain that. We also have an OBD device which we offer, some of our customers pick which gives us another source of data, which we think helps calibrate some of that as well.Andrew Scott KligermanVery, very helpful. And that's pretty amazing. Your accident response product, where you've got under 12 minutes to solve for some of the stuff on site, I'm wondering if you could share with us the fact that the impact on LAE and severity, any loss numbers? Anything you could share there to gain some insight into how that affects your loss ratios?Susan Patricia GriffithYes. I think that's just too new. We're just really dipping into this. We'll probably have more on that in 18 to 24 months, again, it's something that we're interested in. We've always been since probably 30 years ago, want to make sure that we're there for our customers in their greatest time of need. So our -- the biggest thing that we want to do there is to help our customers get help when they need it. And if we can use the data from the impact to start the claim going and get them back into the position they were before the accident, give them that peace of mind, that's pretty important, and that could relate to a lot of great benefits in terms of retention, et cetera. But again, way too soon to be able to share much on that and we'll probably have more in a few years.Andrew Scott KligermanGot it. And just real quickly, you mentioned 40% increased usage in UBI. Could you tell us the percent adoption percent of the overall book of business that you have?Susan Patricia GriffithWe -- from the new perspective, which is what we share externally, it's higher indirect. Jim, correct me if I'm wrong, about 15% in the agency channel. A little bit lower? Okay. A little bit lower in the agency channel and then more in the direct. We offer it to everyone in the direct channel coming in. And obviously, we work with over 40,000 independent agents, some feel more comfortable making that offering, not all do it. But we've seen an increase since 2019, which makes sense. And it's a perfect fix if you believe that you drive safely and maybe you're driving less often for new business across the board as other inflationary pressures hit consumers.John Peter SauerlandI'd just add that, so on the direct channel, this take rate is substantially higher than in the agency channel and also offer that in the commercial space, the demand through the agency channel is very robust. So we're talking about especially with Smart Haul, which is generally larger trucks that have higher average insurance costs, the benefit of enrolling in a program like this is substantial. So agents and consumers or business owners in this case are way more likely to select that as an option. And as Cory said, is highly predictive in that channel as well.OperatorOur next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.Elyse Beth GreenspanMy first question, Tricia, goes to some of your initial comments, right? You said that future rate would be driven by loss trend. I mean I realize that it's a very volatile environment these days, but what are your expectations for loss trend when we think about 2023?Susan Patricia GriffithWe will just continue to watch it. That's why I wanted to give you a little bit of insight in January, taking 1.5 points. What we know is that we closely monitor a lot of these trends. And I mentioned a bunch of them. It's been such a volatile several years that we look at our internal data, UBI data, macroeconomic trends. All I can tell you is that we will be able to react quickly. And that's sort of embedded in everything that we have done in the last 85 years.So when we start to see those or -- see those trends and those experience trends will react quickly. And that's why we feel like we're in a good position because we were able to react quickly to the severity trends that we started to see in late 2021 and why we're sitting in the position, the enviable position we're in now to be able to profitably grow.Elyse Beth GreenspanAnd then on the UBI side, I thought most of this was opted into right for new business customers, and I know that's where you just gained some of the percentage. If you're a current Progressive customer at renewal or just during the length of your policy, can you opt in and choose to use a Snapshot product if you want to try to lower your rate?Susan Patricia GriffithYes. And we actually did, it was in, I think, 2021 maybe or '22. I'm not sure exactly when we did, but we actually sent out material to our current customers when trends start to change to make sure that they had that offering. And we had a small group to accept that but yes, we want to be able to provide that if it makes sense for each driver. But it's normally a new business.Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes. That was when we saw COVID driving down materially and made an offer to our existing customers to save through Snapshot. And not many took us up on that offer. So it's open and available. Customers can do it. They just haven't taken us up on it significantly.Elyse Beth GreenspanAnd then one more quick one. So you guys mentioned the new product is Continuously Monitoring. So the states that you're active in with that Snapshot product, anyone that uses Snapshot, has to be continuously monitored? Or can they opt into a different monitoring period?Jim HaasSo when they opt into the program, it is -- there's only Continuous. You don't get to pick at that. Obviously, we can't force them to continue to monitor forever. So we've got -- sort of the program is designed around that and accommodates when people stop giving us data if they do, but we certainly encourage them to continue to forward that data. The biggest discounts are available that way and the programs designed that will be monitoring continuously.OperatorOur next question comes from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiEven though you feel like you've approached rate adequacy in most states, I'm wondering, since you're growing quite quickly with lower ad spend. Could you get away with getting even more rate? I mean you did mention that some of your competitors are exceeding you guys with rates. Do you feel like it's fine to be cheaper than some given your risk selection?Susan Patricia GriffithWell, we want to be competitive and we want to price to future loss trends. So we continue to look at that, and we will increase rates should we see severity or frequency trends change. And that's why you give that data point in January. So we'll stay on top of trends and we'll continue to grow. And like John said, we haven't opened up our aperture in terms of not looking at things that are important from our underwriting perspective. So still have more leverage from that perspective. But for me, it is all about using the data and pricing accurately as quickly as possible to match each rate to risk.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiGot it. Could you also touch upon your initiative to raise retention amongst multiproduct customers that was mentioned in your filing yesterday? What are the key tenets to achieve that?Susan Patricia GriffithWe know that our customers, and I think most consumers with insurance want stable rates. And so we want to be able to have if possible, even in this kind of volatile environment, what we call small bite of the apple to not have to increase rates like we had to in 2022 to stay ahead of trends. We also have very many offerings. So we have whether it is in our Progressive Advantage Agency where we have a stable curve of home, unaffiliated partners we work with to have more and more of those bundles, Wrights and Robinsons, we'll continue to do that. And we really seek long term to be sort of the destination company. And so whether it's on our paper or not, we think of that in terms of our pillar of being where we're in and how our customers want to shop and buy, so broad coverage.So on the Personal Line side, we sell other people's home company when it doesn't necessarily say where we're going to go. On the Commercial Line side, we also use our product as well as others for a small business, workers' comp, GL, et cetera.So it really is about on the customer and the more we're able to offer them even with the Progressive Advantage Agency where it's -- we work with a lot of different partners ranging from life insurance to travel insurance to jewelry insurance. The more that the customers have and the more that we've earned their trust, the longer they stay.So retention continues to be the holy grail. We're seeing positive improvement. We'll continue to report on that as the quarters unfold, but we do know 2 parts of retention are really about having stable rates and having great service.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiGreat. And is there a segment you're focusing more on? Agency, will that be more focused versus direct?Susan Patricia GriffithNo. We focus across the board. They're a little bit different in terms of control. So an agent can decide if they want to shop it on behalf of the consumer, but they're looking at the same thing as consumers are, and that's making sure that our mutual customers have stable rates with a company with a great brand and great service. But our goal is to extend PLEs across every segment individually and in the aggregate.John Peter SauerlandAs Tricia was saying, Tracy, we're continuing to broaden the offerings to our consumers. So you talked about multi-product households as Tricia was implying, those households stay with us a lot longer than single-product households and much longer than our historical core customer of Sam, what we call the inconsistently insured customer.So our book does continue to shift more towards the Robinsons end of the spectrum which is actually the longer retaining end of the spectrum. We have, as Tricia also noted, seen a setback as we've had to raise rates aggressively. That is coming back. Our PLEs are starting to trend positively at least on the trailing 3 metric. And the trailing 12 is not yet fully turned, but certainly the trailing 3 is the leading indicator of the trailing 12.So we are definitely focusing on more multi-product households as we roll out new products in the Personal Auto space. Increasingly, we find segmentation that can make us more competitive for those preferred customers. Our book continues to shift that way. And as we get to a more stable rating environment, I think you'll see our PLEs continue to grow as they had been before we had to take a lot of rate.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Josh Shanker at Bank of America.Joshua David ShankerCould you please give some insight you have the policy conversion and new application numbers for the full year 2022, but it seems like something inflected in the fourth quarter. Can you give some indication on what's happening fourth quarter versus fourth quarter 2021 in quote conversion and new policy apps and maybe into '23 as well?Susan Patricia GriffithYes. We don't publish new apps on a quarterly basis, but we did want to show it for year-over-year in the opening slides we had. Basically, what happened was shopping started -- the hard market started. We were in a good position, and there's a lot of prospects that began shopping. And we had good coverage at great rates, and we were able to convert.So that's -- it's really sort of when we started to see things turn -- we were in a good position for that from a staffing perspective on the sales side and the claims side. But yes, that's really kind of when we saw the hard market churn. John, do you want to add anything?John Peter SauerlandSure, Josh. We do provide you year-to-date numbers through the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So if you just assume an equal weighting, you can come to a number. But we also, in the presentation, showed you actual charts of those. So you can't see exactly what the number is, but you can help pretty close by look at those charts. So the short story is, conversion was up considerably in the fourth quarter, prospects were up considerably in the fourth quarter. And obviously, new apps as a consequence were up a lot.Joshua David ShankerA question for the Commercial side. Since acquiring Protective, can you talk a little bit about your large fleet offering and how that's changed?Unidentified Company RepresentativeCan you repeat the question, please?Joshua David ShankerI'm sorry, the question was, how has large fleet changed as part of your business since acquiring Protective?Susan Patricia GriffithNot substantially yet. I mean, we're still learning a lot, and the integration is going really well. And it was really something that was additive to what we were growing from our small fleet. So we continue to be excited about the acquisition of Protective and we'll continue, and I've met a couple of times with Mike Miller, who's running Protective. He came from the Commercial Line side and is now running that. So he'll be excited to have his growth plan in play. We've been focusing in the last year, so really on integrating the company within Progressive at large.OperatorOur next question is coming from Meyer Shields with KBW.Meyer ShieldsGreat. Two related questions, I think, this is on Slide 26 with a 15% participation discount. The first is, I was hoping you could talk us through what underpinned the decision to raise the discount. I would have probably naive with guess to that incremental information as less marginal utility?And the second question is, all of equal, if I'm a bad driver, I get a surcharge, then I get a bigger participation discount. And how does that factor into, I guess, retention and profitability?Susan Patricia GriffithYes. I'll let Jim talk about that. I think the larger discount is what John was saying, we're pricing to the curve to the full curve. And so we know those customers are -- have great driving behaviors, and we're going to add them. And of course, the adverse selection is on the drivers that are not so good and the surcharges.Do you want to add anything, Jim?Jim HaasSure. We raised the participation discount in part. We're going to continue as we're asking customers to do more in that case. And we wanted to encourage them and the participation discount creates a larger incentive for that. As for how it would relate if you ultimately got a surcharge on the renewal term, the participation discounts only for the first term, so it was removed when you get to the renewal. And so a bad driver who is now getting a larger surcharge and they're getting a larger discount removed off the first time, which would get us priced more accurately on them in the subsequent terms, which is the goal. So the participation discount is there to encourage people to participate. And then we just price as accurately as we can on the subsequent terms.Meyer ShieldsOkay. Fantastic. That's helpful. Second question, I'm thinking of California, but there may be other regions where rating flexibility is limited. It seems like the economic benefits are of UBI monitoring are enormous. Is there a chance of getting this incorporated into the rating algorithms for more risky states?Susan Patricia GriffithWe'd love to be in California. That's kind of a history from a lot of the proposition 103, things that came up many decades ago. We want to grow in California. We talked about that a lot. It's the most populous state. But in the meantime, we will continue to work with the department to get the rates that we need to make sure that we reach our target profit margins.OperatorOur next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.Jon Paul NewsomeI was hoping you could talk a little bit about if the telematics, particularly the continuous use of telematics are allowing you to effectively change prices faster if the environment changes without having to actually file a rate change? It sounds like that's possible, but I don't know enough about how the formulas work for telematics products to know if you can effectively rate reactive environmental changes through the telematics product without actually changing the filing?Susan Patricia GriffithGood question, Paul. I'll let Jim take that.Jim HaasPaul, you're right. If the customer is continuously monitoring and the driving changes dramatically, like because of a pandemic or something like that, the telematics rating on the renewal would pick that up over time. In terms of the effect of that, you have to be (inaudible) we just started to roll out continuous last year. For the first 6 months, it looks just like it did before, it's not until the renewal that it changes a lot of the states we elevated were towards the back half of the year.So they're just coming up on their first renewal. So -- and then you need to build up a bigger -- that will grow over time to be a bigger share of the in-force book. But right now, it's still early days of that. So it will be a little while before that's like a really effective mechanism for that. Plus, we would need to get the rate on all the people who aren't in UBI, we would do that through traditional means.Jon Paul NewsomeRight. Can you talk about how you can -- how quickly you can change the algorithm as well? Is that something that means that something can go into a filing or you effectively just change the algorithm for both the continuous and the noncontinuous if you see an environmental change of some type?Jim HaasTypically, that's through a filing. We filed the algorithm with the states confidentially and that's typically how that will be done.OperatorOur next question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James.Charles Gregory PetersMost of my telematics questions have been answered. Tricia, in one of your comments, you talked about media spend. I know you guys go through an annual budget. Can you talk to us about your perspective on your advertising media budget for '23 versus '22?Susan Patricia GriffithYes. So I mean, we absolutely do a budget, but then ongoing. We assess it based on the efficiency of the spend. We look at our targeted acquisition cost, our cost per sale and then -- and kind of where we're getting the business from. So I talked a little bit about ambient shopping, which, of course, is really efficient. We're in a little bit more of that position now. But what we will do is as the year progresses, we will continually assess what we need to do to spend more if we believe it's efficient or pull back if we believe we're butting up against our '96 ceiling. And those are conversations that happen continuously.Some things we -- to get sort of advanced discounts we pay for upfront. So those are kind of -- [those spend]. But we have a lot of flexibility, especially on the digital side to bolt back should we need to, like you saw in the last year. So we have a budget, it's fluid, and over the years, it can go up or down depending on what we believe is in the best interest of profitably growing the company.Charles Gregory PetersDoes that answer mean that the budget is higher for '23 versus '22? I'm not sure what it means.Susan Patricia GriffithAt this point in time, it could be higher. I mean things changed. So it was higher last year. If you would have asked me this last January, I said it would be higher than the year before, but it didn't end up being that because we had to make some flexibility. So we budget for what we think could happen with a lot of flexibility.John Peter SauerlandA couple of adds there. So it's -- I would characterize it as dynamic and opportunistic. So to the extent we feel we're adequately priced -- we're going to spend a lot more on advertising. Again, with as Tricia said, an eye towards our targeted acquisition cost that we priced into the product and our lifetime economics on those policies. But if you look at our expense ratio, especially our direct expense ratio for January, as an example, you can see it was up.So clearly, through the latter part of last year as we were working hard to ensure we hit our '96 combined ratio for the year, you saw that expense ratio drop which was driven to a large degree by lower advertising costs. In January, you saw that pop back up, which is a great indicator that we're spending more on advertising right now.Charles Gregory PetersOkay. My second question was on reinsurance. Now the market is hard --you've had. Obviously, reinsurance is an important part of your story last year. Can you talk to us about your perspective on reinsurance and how it might change this year versus last year?Susan Patricia GriffithYes, absolutely. We have Brandon here who runs our reinsurance organization. So I'll have him weigh in.Unidentified Company RepresentativeThanks for the question on reinsurance. I mean, I think we -- particularly with how we adapted to the placement at 1/1, we'll carry that forward to how we look to our June placement, which is really the core part of our program. We tend to be fairly conservative in how we want to retain property cat losses. I think we'll continue that. We'll have to be flexible in what the market is willing to offer as far as how we can tailor that to what we decide to purchase.Charles Gregory PetersDoes that mean you're going to have a higher deductible or a lower deductible?Unidentified Company RepresentativeIt's a little early to say exactly where we're going to land on that. Certainly, the bottom end of reinsurance programs have seen a lot of pressure not just this year but over the last couple of years. We will be looking at other creative options if need be to manage our retention.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Ward with Citi.Michael Augustus WardI did have a question on telematics, specifically the OEM data and vehicles. Just curious if you have any data on the capabilities of the existing vehicles on the road in the U.S. It just -- it seems like that might be limited to more newer vehicles with cellular data connections, which I get the sense might be at least currently might be a fairly small chunk of the vehicle population in the U.S., just given turnover. So just wondering if you can elaborate on that at all?Jim HaasYes, you're correct. The firm we're talking about depends upon vehicles with the cellular connection as we're referring to OEMs over the last several years have been investing in that. They're in really different places depending on the OEM. Some are -- have had been there for a number of years. Some are still working on it. So it's -- and it does take a while for the fleet to turn over.So it's very focused on a few OEMs and the most recent model years. But as we mentioned and then we've got relationships with GM and Toyota, which are 2 of the larger ones. They've got more of an installed base. And we expect other -- almost every OEM is moving in this direction. So we expect that this population will grow over time.Michael Augustus WardOkay. Great. And then maybe could you discuss kind of the take-up between OEM data versus using the mobile phone app route. It just seems like there's more hurdles involved in the mobile app, and that maybe that's why take-up wasn't great initially. And so sort of curious about how you see those 2 trending.Jim HaasAdoption in the whole program overall has been up, and we're happy with the adoption of both mobile and OEM. So we're happy with both of those programs. We just offer different options to consumers depending on how they want to share that data. And so we're just trying to get the biggest footprint we can and both have been increasing.Michael Augustus WardOkay. So maybe just to elaborate on that. I think you guys mentioned that the take-up or the adoption wasn't great for existing customers. And so I'm just curious what -- why might it be great for new customers than is part of it, just the competitors raising rates currently or the shopping is up?Susan Patricia GriffithYes. I would just say it's one of the things that new business when you're asking for a bunch of data to kind of assess the rate to risk. When I talked about the current customers, we were doing that in 2020 because we knew people were struggling with their finances. Everything was going up from groceries to et cetera. So we did sort of a marketing campaign and just most people didn't do it.I think you get sort of -- just like anything, whether it's life insurance or health insurance, you sort of make that decision and then you stick with it. It's something you don't necessarily want to do again. So it's just easier to do a new business when we're acquiring all the information we need for an accurate rate.OperatorOur next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous.Ryan James TunisI had a couple on just the UBI stuff. So the first one, just thinking about the collision detection. I'm curious if maybe that could potentially have some kind of impact on frequency because I would think that there'd be a lot of customers with kind of smaller dollar claims that wouldn't want to tell their insurance company, they got in the crash and just to keep their the rates where they are. So is there any possibility that you knowing that they got in the crash and potentially lead to you actually getting more claims in the door?Jim HaasYes. Thank you, Ryan. It's a good question. In this particular case, the way the crash detection algorithm works, it's looking really for more severe accidents. It's not trying to pick up fender benders. So these are claims that we fully expect would have gotten reported either way. These aren't small-dollar claims, where somebody might just choose either not to repair or to handle it out of pocket. These are larger claims. So we don't think of it. We think we've gotten these claims anyway.Ryan James TunisGot it. And then I guess just thinking about some of the telematics so. So 1 question I had was for the drivers that you find giving really big discounts to be like 40%, what if you look at like kind of the traditional insurance rating variables you used that are not in telematics space, I don't know, ZIP code, FICO, whatever, can you draw any conclusions about like when you're giving really discounts to customers which of the variables tend to have been kind of the [shakiest] predictive indicators? That's the first part.And then also I was just curious about is when you find yourself giving a surcharge for the continuous like 6 months later, you gave the discount, how you're giving a surcharge. What are the main reasons that you're finding that you're having to give a surcharge after giving a discount?Jim HaasSo on the first part of your question in terms of how -- what are the traditional variables and what it informs, the whole point of UBI that is incremental to all of that. So if we could have seen that these variables without UBI, we're inaccurate, we would have fixed it. UBI gives us new information about that customer that the traditional variables didn't let you segment further not just live in the ZIP code or they have this credit score. But this person within that is different than the other person that otherwise looks the same. So that's the point it's improving the segmentation.In terms of the surcharge, the discount we give is a participation discount, which is just for signing up. And so if they move from the discount surcharge, it's simply because we've then gotten that driving data and continuous model, theoretically, people could move from one to the other. But in terms of why someone will get a surcharge, our model, as we kind of share on the website, uses things like hard braking, how much you drive, when you drive variables like that. So folks who tend to get a surcharge drive more and drive -- have more hard brakes this is a sign of how aggressively they're driving. Those are typically some of the variables that figure into that.Ryan James TunisGot it. And just I guess following up, so I hear you it's incremental. But what about just in terms of conclusion, is it usually -- can you say anything about those who get 40% tend to largely be much more preferred or those who get kind of being the 40% discount tend to be more mixed or tend to be a little bit more on -- a little bit less standard?Jim HaasI think the UBI is kind of showing us it's incremental to all of that. So the -- intentionally, we don't want it to look that way. We wanted to be -- if we knew the preferred customers were more likely to get the discount, we just give them a bigger discount in the first place. So we try to use UBI to kind of sort out this preferred customer deserves an even bigger discount. This other preferred customer deserves maybe a surcharge. So it's really, it's segmenting beyond what we already had.Douglas S. ConstantineWe've exhausted our scheduled time. And so that concludes our event. Stacy, I will hand the call back over to you for closing scripts.OperatorThat concludes the Progressive Corporation's Fourth Quarter Investor Event.

391,940c5cc7-bf90-31e5-8cdd-d2f2b0194404,PGR,2023-03-01,UNIVERSAL INSURANCE HOLDINGS INC (UVE) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/universal-insurance-holdings-inc-uve-141502235.html,1677593702,STORY,"['UVE', 'PGR']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Universal Insurance Holdings (UVE)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 51.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $18.82 in the previous session. Universal Insurance Holdings has gained 72.4% since the start of the year compared to the 4.9% move for the Zacks Finance sector and the -0.7% return for the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 23, 2023, Universal Insurance reported EPS of $0.72 versus consensus estimate of $-0.28.For the current fiscal year, Universal Insurance is expected to post earnings of $1.65 per share on $1.35 billion in revenues. This represents a 502.44% change in EPS on a 10.67% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2 per share on $1.48 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 21.21% and 9.55%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUniversal Insurance may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Universal Insurance has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 11.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 13.3X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 15.9X versus its peer group's average of 14.6X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Universal Insurance currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Universal Insurance passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Universal Insurance shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does UVE Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of UVE have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is The Progressive Corporation (PGR). PGR has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of F.Earnings were strong last quarter. The Progressive Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 0.67%, and for the current fiscal year, PGR is expected to post earnings of $6.73 per share on revenue of $58.52 billion.Shares of The Progressive Corporation have gained 4.7% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 21.04X and a P/CF of 31.47X.The Insurance - Property and Casualty industry is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for UVE and PGR, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Valero Energy VLO, Anglo American NGLOY and Hershey HSY.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:U.S. Housing Markets Are Slow: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, a raft of U.S. data and European inflation numbers will give guidance on how the world's top central banks will navigate the way forward.Including whether we're heading for that hotly debated ""no landing"" scenario.In Asia, China's post Lunar New Year business activity data will give a reading of the health of the world's number-two economy.In Africa, Nigerians head to the polls in the first of this year's key emerging market elections.Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders:(1) The Fed vs. StocksReports on U.S. Durable Goods Orders, home prices as well as manufacturing and consumer confidence threaten to cement expectations of more Fed rate hikes and to deal a knockout punch to the early-year stocks rally.Evidence of a stronger-than-expected economy has forced investors to recalibrate projections for Fed hawkishness, lifting bond yields and weighing on stock gains.The S&amp;P500 has managed to hang on to a +4.5% year-to-date gain but is well off its highs.Tuesday's consumer confidence data may be of particular interest, offering a glimpse into households' views on economic prospects and inflation expectations.Economists polled by Reuters expect a median reading of 109.5 on the index, which unexpectedly fell in January.(2) The Idea of “No Landing” for the Global EconomyAre economic conditions becoming too rosy for markets to bear?The idea of ""no landing,"" which upends a host of popular trades based on the scenario of the global economy entering recession is gaining traction thanks to surprisingly upbeat data.Story continuesChina has reopened from COVID lockdowns, U.S. labor markets are booming and consumer spending is holding up, while Europe's energy crisis has eased.Still, inflation remains sticky, which could keep big central banks on their hawkish path of raising interest rates further.This is inconvenient for investors who bought government bonds and bet on a softer dollar this year, expecting economies would decelerate and central banks would pause rate-hike campaigns.A soft landing could still happen.But if data in coming days signal that growth and inflation remain robust, equity and bond markets may turn lower still.(3) Inflation Data from the EurozoneIt's inflation week in the Euro-area. Preliminary February data from Germany, France, Spain and Portugal are due on Monday and Tuesday, followed by the bloc-wide flash number on Thursday.Price pressures are abating: headline Euro-area inflation eased to 8.6% in January from 9.2% a month earlier. Still, Thursday's numbers are unlikely to placate European Central Bank hawks pushing for aggressive rate hikes to continue.Focus will likely stay on core inflation, stripping out volatile food and energy prices. It's proving stubborn and could still rise from January's 5.3%.Markets have got the message and renewed bets on the ECB 2.5% depo rate moving higher. Deutsche Bank just raised its forecast for the peak in ECB rates to 3.75% from 3.25%.(4) Data on China’s ReopeningChina's reopening came fast and furious after a three-year lull.Wednesday's PMI releases could show whether factory activity in the world's second-largest economy has returned with a bang or a whimper after the Lunar New Year break.Strong figures could revive some of the waning enthusiasm for the reopening trade, where optimism seems to be fizzling out. The A-share blue-chip CSI 300 Index is largely flat on the month after surging 7% in January.Retail investors are sitting out the stocks rally, and the recent disappearance of star Chinese dealmaker Bao Fan has investors worrying that Beijing's regulatory crackdowns are far from over.Escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing over a suspected Chinese spy balloon and Taiwan loom large over the China investment thesis.(5) Countries Going to the PollsNigerians vote on Saturday in what could be their most credible and close electoral contest since military rule ended nearly a quarter of a century ago. It's also the first election in which a presidential candidate who is not from one of the two main parties stands a chance.Whomever Nigerians choose to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari will have to resolve a litany of crises that have worsened under the current administration — from widespread banditry and militant violence to systemic corruption, and from high inflation to widespread cash shortages.Many other emerging market economies are also approaching election crossroads.Turkey's government under President Tayyip Erdogan could hold elections in the wake of the devastating earthquake as scheduled in June.Argentina's Peronists are seeking re-election in October and Pakistan voters will likely head to the ballot box the same month.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksI found a solid mix of large-cap stocks on our #1 list this week:(1) Valero Energy: This is a $132 a share U.S. oil refinery company, with a market cap of $50.3B.

393,2ab38abd-ccdf-38f6-bbf0-8ab28a236a62,VLO,2023-03-01,BP & Partners Advance GTA Project to Next Evaluation Phase,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bp-partners-advance-gta-project-133901329.html,1677591541,STORY,['VLO'],"[BP PLC BP and its partners recently validated the development concept for the second phase of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which will move to the next phase of assessment.The consortium, made up of BP, PETROSEN, Société Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures (SMH) and Kosmos Energy, will assess a gravity-based structure (GBS) as the foundation for the GTA Phase 2 extension project (GTA2). This will have an annual capacity of 2.5-3.0 million tons. With the structure serving as both a foundation for liquefaction facilities and a storage facility for LNG, GBS LNG installations, it has a static link to the seabed.The proposed design will also use and build upon the GTA infrastructure by including additional wells and subsea apparatus. In order to reduce operating emissions, the collaboration will look into liquefying LNG using electricity. BP and its partners are now working with contractors to move the idea closer to the pre-FEED stage.According to Gordon Birrell, executive vice president for operations and production at BP, the British energy giant aims to expand solid collaboration with partners and the Governments of Mauritania and Senegal. The idea is to further establish a long-term, prosperous energy hub in West Africa. The Presidents of Mauritania and Senegal accorded the GTA project the designation of ""National Project of Strategic Importance"" in July 2021. This acknowledgement illustrates the host governments' dedication and the project's importance to both the nations.GTA continues to support BP’s objective of creating the most durable hydrocarbons to contribute to energy security.According to BP, a contract for joint exploration and production of the BirAllah gas potential in Mauritania was signed in October 2022. Furthermore, BP continues to collaborate with partners on the construction of Yakaar Teranga, a significant gas-to-power project in Senegal. Most recently, BP and the government of Mauritania signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to deliver a program investigating the possibilities for large-scale green hydrogen generation in the region.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksBP currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy space are Murphy USA Inc.

394,728af229-78cb-349e-a6ec-b71c0d8195f3,UNH,2023-03-01,25 Most Profitable Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-profitable-companies-world-192146617.html,1677612106,STORY,['UNH'],"[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 most profitable companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most profitable companies in the world.There is a great divide in the finance world between revenue, growth and profit. Often times, the focus is on companies who either have already demonstrated significant, or in most cases, companies which have the potential for massive growth in the future, as that will lead to a greater valuation and hence, a greater return for shareholders. Growth here refers to revenue growth and often, targets are set based on expected revenue in the future based on various analytics and data. When a company is newly incorporated with great potential, even though revenue continues to increase significantly year on year, it is generally loss making except in some specific circumstances, due to a lack of economies of scale and high fixed costs and capital investment. Therefore, at this juncture, it is generally the gross margin, or revenue less cost of goods sold, which show the variable profit of a company, which is considered to be an important metric, even though revenue growth is still perhaps the most important factor at this stage.25 most profitable companies in the worldNAR studio/Shutterstock.comHowever, for shareholders of major companies, both public and profit, net profit is one of the most important metrics to consider, which shows the profit of a company after all expenses have been deducted, including both variable and fixed costs, not to mention other expenses such as interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Net profit is what goes to shareholders in the form of dividends, though the majority of their return comes from an increase in the value of the company.One amazing example of a company focusing on growth instead of revenue early on, and which was one of the most profitable companies in the world according to Forbes Global 2000, is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). When Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) started out, for several years, it was a lossmaking company even as its revenue saw outstanding growth and the company dominated the online retailer industry. The company adopted a policy of providing extremely low prices to attract customers and driving out competitors while hemorrhaging money, as losses continued to pile up. It took Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) 14 years to make as much profit as it did finally in the last quarter in 2018. Now, it is easily one of the biggest companies in the world as its dominance only continues to improve, with Jeff Bezos's policy of growth over meeting quarterly earnings targets achieved great success in the long term. Many other companies, though, are not so lucky, as consistently making losses is not generally a viable strategy long term.Story continuesHowever, in this ever-advancing world, profit is no longer the only important consideration for shareholder; environmental, social and governance (ESG) has made its mark, which is why some of the most profitable companies in the world also have a lot in common with the biggest ESG companies in the world. Considering the negative impacts major companies have on the environment and climate change, there has been significant backlash against their practices, which is why companies have had to focus more on sustainability in addition to profits, and make significant investments to bring to fruition their ambitious ESG targets. While ESG was initiated decades ago, the world has started taking it much more seriously now, since the impact of climate change isn't just known, but is being felt across the world.To determine the most profitable companies in the world was not an easy task. To start off, we obtained profits on the top 2000 companies in the world courtesy of Forbes. We then filtered the 50 companies with the highest profits, and updated the profit figures based on the trailing twelve month profits from Yahoo Finance. Remember, even though some of them may have made losses recently, they are traditionally among the most profitable companies in this world, and hence, deserving of a place in this list. We have also only focused on net income from continuing operations to truly reflect a company's profitability. Some energy companies, as a result of the Russia Ukraine war and the increase in energy prices, have recorded their best ever profits in history and hence, jumped several places in this list. So, let's take a look at the companies which combined reported profits of well over $950 billion, starting with (all TTM net profit figures are in millions):25.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Payroll Companies in the World. Today's corporate world is significantly different from companies of the past. The growth in industries and employment often leaves firms with thousands of employees and makes managing their needs a complex task requiring additional investments and teams which end up diverting attention from their strategic business operations and objectives.To respond to these needs, companies that provide services such as human resources management have sprung up, which allows employers to outsource these functions in order to save up on significant capital expenditures. One such sector is the payroll industry, which consists of firms that offer software products to enable employers to manage their employees and outsourcing solutions that completely take over the function.As the economy and industry grow, this sector itself is worth billions of dollars. According to a research report from Vantage Market Research, the global human resource payroll software market was worth $25 billion in 2021 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9% between then and 2028 to sit at an estimated $46.6 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that several advantages offered by the software such as consolidating several human resources functions under a single roof, tracking working workings, and providing adequate security are key reasons that many companies prefer it. It adds that Asia Pacific will be the strongest growing region in terms of adaptability and that the industry is still reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic since small and medium businesses that form the bulk of its customer base are yet to return to pre pandemic productivity.One of the world's premier payroll products providers Paychex, Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most profitable companies in the world.There is a great divide in the finance world between revenue, growth and profit. Often times, the focus is on companies who either have already demonstrated significant, or in most cases, companies which have the potential for massive growth in the future, as that will lead to a greater valuation and hence, a greater return for shareholders. Growth here refers to revenue growth and often, targets are set based on expected revenue in the future based on various analytics and data. When a company is newly incorporated with great potential, even though revenue continues to increase significantly year on year, it is generally loss making except in some specific circumstances, due to a lack of economies of scale and high fixed costs and capital investment. Therefore, at this juncture, it is generally the gross margin, or revenue less cost of goods sold, which show the variable profit of a company, which is considered to be an important metric, even though revenue growth is still perhaps the most important factor at this stage.25 most profitable companies in the worldNAR studio/Shutterstock.comHowever, for shareholders of major companies, both public and profit, net profit is one of the most important metrics to consider, which shows the profit of a company after all expenses have been deducted, including both variable and fixed costs, not to mention other expenses such as interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Net profit is what goes to shareholders in the form of dividends, though the majority of their return comes from an increase in the value of the company.One amazing example of a company focusing on growth instead of revenue early on, and which was one of the most profitable companies in the world according to Forbes Global 2000, is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). When Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) started out, for several years, it was a lossmaking company even as its revenue saw outstanding growth and the company dominated the online retailer industry. The company adopted a policy of providing extremely low prices to attract customers and driving out competitors while hemorrhaging money, as losses continued to pile up. It took Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) 14 years to make as much profit as it did finally in the last quarter in 2018. Now, it is easily one of the biggest companies in the world as its dominance only continues to improve, with Jeff Bezos's policy of growth over meeting quarterly earnings targets achieved great success in the long term. Many other companies, though, are not so lucky, as consistently making losses is not generally a viable strategy long term.Story continuesHowever, in this ever-advancing world, profit is no longer the only important consideration for shareholder; environmental, social and governance (ESG) has made its mark, which is why some of the most profitable companies in the world also have a lot in common with the biggest ESG companies in the world. Considering the negative impacts major companies have on the environment and climate change, there has been significant backlash against their practices, which is why companies have had to focus more on sustainability in addition to profits, and make significant investments to bring to fruition their ambitious ESG targets. While ESG was initiated decades ago, the world has started taking it much more seriously now, since the impact of climate change isn't just known, but is being felt across the world.To determine the most profitable companies in the world was not an easy task. To start off, we obtained profits on the top 2000 companies in the world courtesy of Forbes. We then filtered the 50 companies with the highest profits, and updated the profit figures based on the trailing twelve month profits from Yahoo Finance. Remember, even though some of them may have made losses recently, they are traditionally among the most profitable companies in this world, and hence, deserving of a place in this list. We have also only focused on net income from continuing operations to truly reflect a company's profitability. Some energy companies, as a result of the Russia Ukraine war and the increase in energy prices, have recorded their best ever profits in history and hence, jumped several places in this list. So, let's take a look at the companies which combined reported profits of well over $950 billion, starting with (all TTM net profit figures are in millions):25.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Income-generating stocks are all the rage as the stock market suffered huge losses last year. According to a report by Reuters, Wall Street recorded its biggest annual drop in 2022 since the financial crisis of 2008, as the S&amp;P 500 shed nearly $8 trillion in market cap. Growth stocks also recorded their worst performance in a decade, turning investors’ attention toward overlooked dividend equities.Quality companies that have raised their payouts for a significant period are considered safe during fluctuating market conditions. Historical analysis of these stocks shows that they have outperformed their peers when turbulence in the market occurs. Over the past five decades, dividend growers have surpassed other asset classes when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually, as reported by Sterling Capital. Another reason why dividends make reliable investments is due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. According to a report by Schroders, the average annual return across eight markets was 4.3% in the last 25 years, which increased to an average of 7.1% including reinvested dividends.Analysts often advise investing in companies that have proven track records of dividend growth, as these companies are likely to continue growing their payouts in the long term. In addition to this, such companies are considered less risky as they have stable cash flows and histories of profitability. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some major dividend companies with solid dividend growth streaks and strong balance sheets. In view of this, we will discuss the best consistent dividend stocks to buy in this article.Story continues16 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for at least 10 years.

(NYSE:WSM), worth over $305.3 million collectively.Voss Capital mentioned Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We believe shorting furniture retailers has arguably become a consensus view on the back of widely known tough comps from early 2021 (+26% and +40% SSS Comps for WSM in calendar Q1/Q2 ‘21) and fear of pull forward of demand, which seems to be corroborated by weak credit card data in the category the last few weeks and a poor outlook from furniture e-Commerce giant Wayfair, not to mention a panic-inducing, rambling conference call from the oft colorful CEO of Restoration Hardware. Lazy thematic macro analysis that stops there, however, paints an incomplete picture of what has transpired at many individual companies like WSM that have been deemed COVID beneficiaries that are now at all-time low valuations.WSM is a furniture and home décor retailer that owns several well-known brands: William Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Rejuvenation, Mark &amp; Graham, and most importantly, west elm. While perhaps thought of as a dying mall-based brick &amp; mortar retailer, WSM derives the vast majority (66%+) of its revenue from e-Commerce and has been a remarkably steady performer, remaining free cash flow positive every year since at least 2007 and achieving positive same store sales comps since 2010, including +17% in 2020, +22% in 2021 with guidance for a further mid-to-high single digit growth again this year. Within the overall positive sales trends, west elm’s consistent growth has been even more impressive, with a 16% average annual same-store sales growth rate since 2012. To little fanfare, by our calculation, WSM has become the single highest quality retailer in public markets with a 58% return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2021 and a 39% ROIC on average over the past 3 years…” (Click here to see the full text)14.

The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)10. Waste Management, Inc.

It may seem strange to sell a position with this backdrop, but I did so for two reasons. First, it was purchased in the first place as a reasonably priced defensive during an orgy of speculation. In this context, CASY served its purpose. Second, given the developments of the past year and Upslope’s overall still-defensive portfolio, I think there are better uses of capital today – specifically cheaper, less-defensive longs. Some of these are highlighted in Exhibit 4 below.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles:Top Investors' Stocks Portfolio: Mid-Cap Stocks12 High Growth Software Stocks that are Profitable12 High Growth Healthcare Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

JetBlue has partnered CHOOOSE to create a new online platform, which allows passengers to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from flights. To stop these harmful emissions, passengers can make financial contributions to fund the usage of environment-friendly sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on JetBlue flights. When compared with traditional petroleum-based fuels, the usage of SAF can bring about an 80% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. In 2022, a mere 0.3% of JetBlue’s fuel consumed was SAF. JBLU aims to convert 10 % of its total fuel to SAF by 2030.4.

""Time for more airlines to follow suit.""Biden had urged airlines in his State of the Union earlier this month to take the action, saying, ""Baggage fees are bad enough - airlines can't treat your child like a piece of baggage.""Airlines for America, which represents the largest U.S. airlines, has said its carriers do not charge for family seating. Other carriers have not adopted the commitment in customer service plans.Carriers that do not honor commitments in written plans can face enforcement actions from the U.S. Department of Transportation.USDOT plans to propose regulations to bar airlines from family seating fees and will next week disclose on a government dashboard which airlines have committed to not charging such fees.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the family seating dashboard will ""show which airlines guarantee families can sit together for free"" and praised American Airlines ""becoming the first U.S. airline to commit to putting this guarantee in its customer service plan.""American said its written plan ""provides additional clarity"" and is ""proud to offer industry leading, customer-friendly policies that ensure a positive travel experience for families.""Buttigieg noted last week U.S. budget carrier Frontier Airlines introduced measures under which at least one parent will automatically be seated with any children within their family group who are under the age of 14 at no additional cost.United Airlines said last week it would make it easier for children under 12-years old to sit next to an adult by using a new seat map dynamically locating available adjacent seats at booking.Biden in September touted his administration's ""cracking down"" on U.S. airlines to improve treatment of passengers after they updated customer service plans for services provided when flights are canceled or delayed. Nearly all airlines agreed to offer passengers meals and overnight stays for delays within their control.Delta Air Lines said Tuesday it ""does not charge family seating fees and regardless of the ticket class purchased, will always work with customers on a case-by-case basis to ensure their family seating needs are met.""

FiltonI'm Steve Filton. Marc Miller is joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.43 for the fourth quarter of 2022. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, primarily an asset impairment charge associated with an acute care hospital in Las Vegas, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.02 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.Story continuesMarc D. MillerDuring the fourth quarter, our acute care hospitals experienced a decrease in the number of patients with a coded diagnosis treated in our hospitals as compared to the prior year quarter. As a percentage of total admissions, COVID diagnosed patients made up 7% of our admissions in the fourth quarter of 2021 but only about half of that percentage of admissions in the fourth quarter of 2022. This decline in COVID patients resulted in reduced revenues due to the lower acuity and less of the incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients. While overall surgical volumes tended to recover to pre-pandemic levels, there was a measurable shift from inpatient to outpatient, resulting in further overall revenue softness. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the quarter which declined from a peak of $153 million in the first quarter was $85 million in the fourth quarter, similar to what it was in the third quarter. In total, there was insufficient revenue growth to offset the accelerated rate of wage increases and other inflationary pressures, leading to an acute EBITDA result in the quarter below our internal forecasts. At the same time, this decline in COVID activity allowed our behavioral hospitals to continue to reduce their labor vacancies, resulting in a reduction of the capping of bed capacity. The effect of the increased revenue largely offset higher labor costs, leading to a behavioral EBITDA result in the quarter more in line with our internal forecasts.Steve G. FiltonDo also note that the fourth quarter included approximately $10 million of losses related to start-up facilities. Our cash generated from operating activities was $297 million during the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to $322 million during the same quarter in 2021. The decline was largely due to the opening of new facilities and the timing of receipt of certain supplemental reimbursements. We spent $734 million on capital expenditures during 2022. In reaction to the earnings softness experienced during the year, we reduced the pace of our capital expenditure spend by about [1 quarter] from our original plans for the year. Similarly, we moderated the trajectory of our share repurchases. For the full year of 2022, we acquired $811 million of our own shares pursuant to our share repurchase program. Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in 2014, we have repurchased more than 20% of the company's outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2022, we had $886 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.Marc D. MillerOur 2023 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night's release, envisions 2023 as a year of continued transition into a post-pandemic world. We anticipate that volumes in both segments and acuity in our acute business will continue their recovery trajectory and gradually begin to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. Similarly, we expect to be able to reduce premium pay by about 1/3 in 2023 from 2022 levels as we continue to increase hiring rates and reduce turnover as a result of multiple recruitment and retention programs that have been implemented over the last few years. Again, we've assumed these improvements will occur incrementally during the year but will be partially offset by wage pressures created by a continued shortage of nurses and other clinical personnel and by broader inflationary pressures affecting our other expenses. We note that in our acute segment, physician subsidy expense is specifically anticipated to increase by a substantial amount. Other headwinds that are reflected in our 2023 forecast are approximately $100 million in COVID-related reimbursement received in 2022 but phased out in 2023 as well as a reduction of about $30 million in supplemental reimbursement payments as disclosed in our 10-K. Finally, we will incur a significant increase in interest expense in 2023, about 3/4 of which was due to rising interest rates and the remainder to increased borrowings. Despite these challenges, we note that some of the operating indicators in early 2023 have been encouraging, especially in our behavioral health business. During the pandemic, we have found the pace of recovery from several of the aforementioned challenges has often been slower than we originally anticipated and have reflected that gradual cadence of recovery in our forecast. However, we remain confident in the fundamental strength of both our business segments, given our well-positioned hospital franchises around the country. We are pleased to answer questions at this time.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first call comes from the line of Andrew Mok with USB (sic) [UBS].Andrew MokYou mentioned softer revenue in the acute segment due to lower acuity. Can you elaborate on the trends in surgical volumes and underlying acuity that you saw in the fourth quarter? And what do you have embedded in the guide for 2023? Or when do you expect that to normalize?Steve G. FiltonYes, Andrew. So I think as Marc remarked in his commentary, and you can see in our press release metrics, revenue per adjusted admission was actually down for the quarter, I think attributable to a few factors. One is the decline in COVID patients, those COVID patients, particularly last year, particularly the Omicron patients tended to be higher acuity patients. And the loss of those patients and the loss of their good reimbursement reduces our acuity in our revenue. In addition to that, Marc talked about the shift -- the accelerated shift from inpatient to outpatient. Our surgical volumes in Q4, actually, we're probably 3% or 4% above what they were in Q4 of 2019, the last pre-pandemic quarter or full pre-pandemic quarter, but clearly, there's been an accelerated shift. I think that outpatient procedures are probably up 7% or 8%, and inpatient procedures are sort of flattish. So I think those are the main drivers of the acuity softness in Q4. As far as what we have built into the guidance for next year, I think, again, as Marc's sort of comments reflected, I think we're projecting a gradual sort of return to normalcy. So for the year, I think our general notion is that acute care revenue per adjusted admission should increase probably in that 2% to 4% range, which would be much closer to sort of the historical norms.OperatorOur next call comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.Stephen C. Baxter(inaudible) Or least directionally by segment. Appreciating the color you gave on some of the onetime items in the acute care business. It sounds like that's likely the source of maybe some of the year-on-year pressure there, but it'd be great if you could elaborate a little bit on what you're expecting for year-over-year margin trends in both, the acute and the behavioral business?Steve G. FiltonYes, Steve, I think we missed the beginning part of your question somehow. So if you wouldn't mind repeating it, I apologize.Stephen C. BaxterYes. Sorry about that. So yes, the additional color on EBITDA growth and top line growth by segment would be great. Just trying to understand a little bit when we look at the year-over-year margin pressure, where that's coming from? It sounds like with some of the items you flagged on the acute side, it looks like that's probably it, but just a better sense on the direction of margin trends in both businesses.Steve G. FiltonYes. So I think on the acute side, there are specific headwinds, again, most of which I think Marc elaborate on. One and probably the biggest 1 is $100 million of COVID-related reimbursement that includes the Medicare 20% add-on, the (inaudible) reimbursement and Medicare sequestration labor, all of which get phased out at 1 point or another or already phased out in 2023. I'll throw into that, although not COVID related, another $10 million or so of 340B reimbursement that's going to get recouped in 2023. In addition to that, there's -- Marc noted about $30 million of supplemental Medicaid reimbursement that declines next year. That's about $20 million in the behavioral business and $10 million in the acute business. I think the other main issue is that even though, again, as Marc commented, we're expecting premium pay to decline another 1/3, maybe another $150 million, $160 million in 2023, what our experience has been is that the savings from that, and there certainly are some savings, but the savings from that are offset to a large degree by increased base wages, recruitment incentives, sign-on bonuses, that sort of thing. I think what our guidance, particularly in the acute business implies or assumes is that all those trends sort of incrementally improve as the year goes on. But those are the headwinds, I think, specifically on the acute side of the business that mainly sort of tend to suppress the margins. And on the behavioral side, it's really more on the labor side. I mean I think we're at -- in both businesses is that at the moment, even though revenues are recovering, particularly on the behavioral side, salary expense or wage expense is still outpacing the growth in revenues. I think we believe that by the second half of 2023, that begins to sort of stabilize, and we start to sort of get to a more normalized historical pattern of revenue growth exceeding salary growth. But in the first half of the year, that's not the case. And again, I think that's probably the main driver of the margin pressure next year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi.Jason Paul CassorlaGreat. I just wanted to ask about the move to wind down in patient operations at your Desert Springs hospital. Maybe just -- can you unpack that a bit more in the decision there, what the EBITDA lift could be on the go forward? And then anything else to note from a competitive perspective as we think about your Las Vegas market broadly?Marc D. MillerYes, sure. I can answer that for you. So we obviously -- that's a very important market for us. We've been looking at the whole market -- the market as a whole for many years. We continue to try to build where we can at current properties as well as some of our de novo projects. We have a new project that's going in, that is really -- we're looking at it as a replacement hospital for Desert Springs. Originally, we had hoped to keep Desert Springs operating longer into the future and closer to our opening date, if not all the way up to our opening date for our new West Henderson Hospital. But the market dynamics caused us to have to accelerate the plan there. So what we've done basically is we're moving that hospital to a glorified emergency services facility, and we'll continue to run those services even after we have our new hospital in West Hendersonville, and we're really transferring just about all of those employees to other Valley system facilities. So we're -- it's been misreported that we're laying off a lot of employees. In fact, we're really not. And like I said, just about every one of those employees is finding a home in another 1 of our hospitals, which has helped alleviate some of the staffing pressures that we've had. So that's really the situation. I don't know the timing on the numbers. West Henderson won't be open for about another 1.5 years, I want to say middle to late '24?Steve G. FiltonYes.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceMaybe just 2 items. And when I think about your outlook, I think you mentioned that you're assuming an uptick in physician subsidy expense. I wondered what's happening there. I know in the back half of the year, your other operating expense in '22 seemed to step up. Are you just assuming that continues? Or is there something else going on there and chances to mitigate? And then any update on your capital deployment [funds?] I know you probably got some share repurchase in the '23 outlook. Can you just comment on that and anything else that you're thinking about from a capital standpoint?Steve G. FiltonSure, A.J. Yes, so physician subsidy expense, I think, has been kind of an emerging challenge for most of the acute hospital industry, I would say, for at least the back half of 2022, and I think most acknowledge it will continue into next year. So that's -- when we talk about that, we're really talking about the -- generally, the contract service expense we pay to physicians who are providing services in [our] emergency rooms, anesthesiologists, radiologists, those are probably the major groups. And you're right, we have seen some increase in those expenses this year. I think we continue to assume that 2023 will probably result in another 15% to 20% increase in those expenses and the magnitude of that is probably a $45 million, $50 million increase in costs. Now I think long term, we have a number of strategies to deal with that cost pressure, including in-sourcing some of that activity to the degree that we can and competitively bidding contracts, et cetera. I think at the moment, we're caught in a tough situation, because it's difficult to change those arrangements in the short term. But in the long term, I think a lot of those pressures are a result of some of the internal struggles that some of those larger staffing -- physician staffing companies are having. And I think as those work their way out and the market adjusts, we will see some easing of that in future years. But we've assumed, as Marc said, a substantial increase in '23. As far as capital deployment goes, we've got embedded in the budget about $600 million of share repurchase assumed. And we've also got about $800 million of capital expense or capital expenditures assumed in the budget as we've disclosed in the press release.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays.Steven James Valiquette(inaudible)Steve G. FiltonSteven, can I interrupt? You're breaking up. So unless we can get a better connection, I can't hear your question. I apologize.OperatorWould you please restate your question?Steven James ValiquetteNot sure it's better or not.Steve G. FiltonYes, that's better.OperatorPlease, go ahead.Steven James Valiquette(inaudible)Steve G. FiltonSteve, I apologize. You're breaking up again. Maybe you can try to call back with -- on a different line.OperatorYes, Steven, you can reenter the queue. Call back in and reenter the queue. (Operator Instructions)We'll go to our next questioner who is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.Justin LakeCan you hear me okay?Steve G. FiltonYes, we can.Justin LakeSo Steve, I was hoping -- it sounds like there's a very different trajectory between the acute business, given the headwinds there in the behavioral business, which seems to be acting better. So within the full year guidance, can you give us a little color on the growth we should expect year-over-year, broken down between the acute business, the behavioral business and then maybe even the kind of corporate segment would be helpful as well? And then, Marc, maybe you could give us a little more color on what you're seeing on the shift from inpatient to outpatient. And what's driving that? How big an impact is it having? And how are you thinking about it into 2023?Steve G. FiltonYes. So looking at the 2 segments discretely, I think as we've suggested a number of times in the past, we thought that as COVID volumes declined, the recovery in the behavioral business would be more accelerated than in the acute in large part, because there was never any benefit to increased (inaudible) volume in the behavioral business. We didn't get paid anymore for patients. And quite frankly, it created more staffing challenges. It created more sort of patient matching challenges, that sort of thing. So what I think you saw in the fourth quarter, and I think a continuation, quite frankly, what we saw in the third quarter, was, as COVID volumes declined, I think Marc commented on this at the outset of the call, we've been able to more successfully fill our nursing and other clinical vacancies and as a consequence of being able to incrementally improve our volumes, particularly as measured by patient days. And that continues into next year. With the challenges I indicated, I think, in an earlier call is the price we've had to pay to fill those vacancies is higher base wages and some incentive payments and that sort of thing, which I think suppresses margins certainly at the beginning of the year, although hopefully, they improve as the year progresses. But probably, at the end of the day, the 2023 forecast assumes slightly increased margins in the behavioral business. The acute business, a little bit different as we talked about. They have to replace the benefit of the COVID volumes that they had. They've got to deal with the headwinds that we were specific about as such. So at the end of the day, I think that acute care EBITDA and -- is relatively flat in 2023, which means margins are down slightly. We have some increase in corporate costs, things like our equity -- stock equity compensation or incentive compensation, because we're assuming that we'll meet targets more fully in 2023 than we did in '22, so that sort of thing. So I think slightly increasing margins on the behavioral side, slightly declining on the acute side and some kind of [disparate] sort of cost increases on the corporate side to get to the full budget guidance that we provided.Marc D. MillerAnd with regards to your question on inpatient versus outpatient, I mean, I think we're seeing what many are seeing, which is a continued shift to outpatient that has been accelerated. Through the pandemic, we're trying to continue to do a lot of the things that we've been doing in the last few years, which is to ensure that we have the proper [pace] load in our inpatient surgical areas, especially with the increases in costs for staffing those areas. We want to make sure that we have the proper acuity. We're not doing low-level cases, really outpatient cases in an inpatient setting where we can't cover the cost properly. So our shift, I think, is pretty similar to a lot of others. We are also trying to accelerate our development of surgical centers, so that we have more opportunities and more platforms for all of our surgery cases in as many markets as possible. So we continue to develop those as we find opportunities to do so.OperatorOur next call comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.Philip Chickering(inaudible) behavioral -- can you hear me?OperatorYes.Steve G. FiltonYes, we can hear you now.Philip ChickeringOkay. There we go. On behavioral, how many beds are left that you can't staff? And how do you think that ramps during 2023? And as staffing and behavior becomes easier post-COVID, I'm wondering what areas of health care were the biggest source of those hires? And then finally, as you can start staffing again, do you increase your CapEx for behavioral beds to keep driving growth there over the next few years?Steve G. FiltonYes. So Pito, it's -- I'll give you a number. I mean, I think we're down to a few hundred beds in behavioral that we would consider capped on most days. Now to be fair, that number can change literally day-to-day, et cetera. So we do still feel like the patients are turned away in certain situations, because we don't have appropriate staffing. A lot of times that may be specific to, let's say, weekend or overnight staffing or it really does differ by facility. But you're right. I mean that's probably been the single biggest headwind for the behavioral business during the pandemic in large part, because we were losing employees, mostly nurses, but other clinical personnel, therapists, psychologists, et cetera to other settings where either they had the opportunity to work remotely or they had the opportunity to work in an acute care setting, making sort of premium dollars. As those opportunities have declined and I think telemedicine procedures have intended to decline as the pandemic has eased and certainly, the demand from acute care hospitals for COVID treating nurses, I think, has declined as well, we're seeing more of those nurses return to what I would describe as the behavioral fold. To your sort of last question, yes, I mean, obviously, we've been more tempered, if you will, about behavioral capacity addition during the pandemic, because the thought was what's the point of adding additional capacity if we're not going to be able to staff it. But as those staffing pressures continue to ease, I think we've made the point throughout the pandemic that we think that the underlying demand for behavioral services across the full continuum is quite strong and robust, and we still believe that. And so yes, we are certainly looking and trying to gauge in individual markets where additional capacity may be called for, because the demand is there and because we feel like we can adequately staff any additional capacity that we've built.OperatorOur next call will come from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin, please wait until you hear your name announced. Kevin?Kevin Mark FischbeckSo I guess on the call last quarter, you mentioned that I think that there's a tailwind this year from start-up losses year-over-year. Can you just remind us kind of how we should be thinking about that? And then you kind of in your opening remarks mentioned that this year is kind of still a normalization off of COVID. I mean do you feel like 2023 is now going to be a solid base off of which we should be expecting normal growth in acute and [psych?] Or do you feel like because of the way you're assuming progression through the year on these dynamics that even 2024 could see some year-over-year SKU comparisons?Steve G. FiltonYes. So as far as your first question on start-up losses, Kevin, we mentioned in -- or I mentioned in today's call that we had $10 million in the quarter, I think we had said at the -- in our third quarter call that we had $45 million of year-to-date start-up losses. So $55 million for the year. The biggest chunk of that is our acute care hospital that we opened early in '22 in Reno. That's probably a $30 million, $35 million swing from '22 to '23, a positive swing. The other $15 million, $20 million of losses are a handful, maybe 3 or 4 behavioral openings in the year, maybe 4 or 5, and we probably have a similar number of openings next year. I think we believe we'll do a little bit better in emerging from the pandemic and getting these things ramping up faster. But I wouldn't necessarily describe that as a material tailwind. So I think we've got about a $30 million, $35 million tailwind in the budget for our turnaround in our Reno hospital. As far as just sort of how we think about 2023, is it sort of kind of a clean post-pandemic year? Marc made comments in his opening remarks about the idea that, number one, I think we view '23 as a transition year. And we do so, because I think 1 of the lessons that we've learned during the pandemic is that even as COVID volumes decline, there is this sort of transition period as nurses returned to their regular jobs and physicians return to their regular practices and patients return to their regular utilization practices, et cetera. So I think we think about that occurring gradually over the course of 2023. I would say probably the back half of 2023 looks a lot more like maybe the back half of 2019, the last sort of COVID-free half a year that we've experienced. And then in 2024, I would imagine, unless there is some unforeseen development begins to look like a really true post-pandemic year.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next call comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs, please stand by Jamie. Jamie?Jamie Aaron PerseCan you guys hear me okay?OperatorYes.Steve G. FiltonWe can.Jamie Aaron PerseOkay. Great. First, just a quick numbers question. Can you provide the revenue base for the insurance subsidiary and what the margin looks like on that? And then my longer-term question is just for -- in this structurally higher wage inflation environment for nurses, given the tightness in that market, what can you do over the medium term to just get more efficient? What does that mean for care team design or investment in labor-saving technologies? Just anything you're doing to become more efficient on the labor front.Steve G. FiltonYes. So in answer to your question about our insurance subsidiary in the acute segment, it has roughly or will have in '23, about $400 million of premium revenue, and we'll run as we sort of discussed in the past, kind of a modest margin in the low single digits. The real motivation in operating that insurance subsidiary is to create sort of a full continuum of care in our acute care markets, greater integration with our physicians, et cetera. It's not really designed to be terribly profitable on its own. As far as your second question about recruitment retention, look, there's a lot of things, and we could have a whole separate hour-long call. And Marc, I think, alluded to multiple recruitment and retention initiatives that we've implemented during the pandemic. But I think you specifically asked about sort of patient care treatment sort of treatment structures and whatnot. And we've tried to, in both of our businesses, create staffing infrastructures that are not so reliant on registered nurses, because those have been the most difficult positions to recruit [to] during the pandemic. So we're becoming more reliant on things like LPNs and LVNs and mental health techs in the behavioral business and EMTs and that sort of thing in our emergency rooms, all those kinds of things. So we certainly have been working to really improve the recruitment and retention of the nursing population itself but also trying to reduce our reliance, particularly on registered nurses who have been the most difficult to recruit.Marc D. MillerBut I'll just add, there are a number of technological solutions that are being bandied about on both sides, both segments. And we continue to evaluate a lot of those as some of our peers do as well. I do think in the coming years, there will be some that we go forward with. I'm not sure that there -- and any of them are going to be a real panacea, but I do think that they can be helpful depending on cost to alleviate some of the staffing issues that we've had over the past few years going forward. So we are excited about the possibility of some of those adding to the mix in the coming years.OperatorOur next call will come from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Please stand by. Ben?Benjamin HendrixJust a quick regulatory question. There was a proposed rule from CMS concerning the 1115 waiver payment and implications there for calculation of a disproportional share payments for acute. Just wanted to see if you guys had any initial thoughts on that? I think you may have probably less exposure to that than some of your peers, but I just wanted to get any initial takes on that proposed rule.Steve G. FiltonYes. So we've commented a number of times and would reference or direct people to our 10-K filing, where we detail in -- pretty specific detail our supplemental Medicaid payments in the current year in 2022 and then what we expect for '23. I mentioned before, we're expecting about a $30 million decline next year across a number of states. To your point, Ben, I don't think we're expecting a big change inside the (inaudible), the 1115 change. But in total, there's about a $30 million reduction in supplemental payments next year, including [disproportionate] share over maybe 2 or 3 states.OperatorThank you. There are no additional questions in the queue. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Steve for any closing remarks.Steve G. FiltonWe'd just like to thank everybody for their time this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your participation today. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.]"

FCX, Southern Copper Corp. SCCO and Coeur Mining CDE.Industry: Mining - Non-FerrousLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2059159/3-non-ferrous-metal-mining-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryThe prospects of the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry look bleak, as apprehensions about slowing demand in China and economic activity have been weighing down commodity prices. Additionally, the industry players are grappling with inflated input costs, particularly energy, and labor shortages and supply-chain issues.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Southern Copper Corp. and Coeur Mining. These companies are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs, while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries, including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy.Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process. Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit, followed by the assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, precede actual mining.The miners continually search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally, as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Fears of Rate Hikes, Weak Demand in China Hurt Prices: Copper prices have declined for the major part of 2022 due to varied reasons — the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, resurgent COVID-19 outbreaks in top consumer China, the Russia-Ukraine situation, the spike in energy costs and low global inventories. Zinc and nickel prices were also weighed down by worries about weak demand as COVID-19 lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession.Story continuesGold and silver prices had also been negatively impacted, owing to a stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth. Recently, stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data has fueled expectations of further monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve, which, in turn, has impacted commodity prices. Also, demand has been lower than expected in China, which is impacting prices. Slower-than-expected demand recovery following the Lunar New Year holiday in China has been impacting metal prices.Cost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues.Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.Demand and Supply Imbalance to Eventually Support Prices: The industry players are dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and a lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future, given their wide use in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials.The demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy is expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals.While demand remains strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, would favor the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #189, which places it in the bottom 24% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of this year, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have moved down 27%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 6% in the past year compared with the Zacks Basic Materials sector’s decline of 6.1%. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped 10.9% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining- Non Ferrous stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 8.14X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.71X. The Basic Materials sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is at 6.88X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 8.88X and as low as 4.80X, with the median being at 5.95X.3 Mining-Non Ferrous Stocks to Keep an Eye onCoeur Mining:  Over the past five years, CDE has invested around $245 million in exploration investment, which has resulted in peer-leading reserve and resource growth, and longer mine lives. Backed by these efforts, on a gold-equivalent basis, reserves have increased 34% net of depletion, measured and indicated resources have grown by 80%, and inferred resources have expanded 26% since 2017.CDE’s exploration investments remain focused on generating attractive returns from near-term priorities, including mine life extensions at Kensington, which was achieved in 2022. Resource growth at the high-grade Silvertip project in British Columbia, and additional enhancements to Rochester’s reserve and resource pipeline will also aid growth. Construction at Rochester is scheduled to be completed by mid-year 2023.The sale of Crown Sterling holdings completed last year is consistent with Coeur Mining’s strategy of monetizing non-core assets and prioritizing high-return growth from its North American asset portfolio. CDE shares have gained 3.1% over the past six months.This Chicago, IL-based company explores, develops, and produces gold, silver, zinc and lead properties with five operations in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 50%. The estimate has been unchanged over the past 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Freeport-McMoRan: FCX’s exploration activities near existing mines, which are focused on expanding reserves, will drive growth. It is expected to benefit from the ongoing large-scale concentrator expansion project at Cerro Verde that will likely result in incremental annual productions of 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum.Cerro Verde's expanded operations will also offer cost efficiencies, and large-scale and long-lived reserves.  It is assessing a large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material. The expansion at Morenci increased milling rates. The Lone Star project in eastern Arizona has been completed and is on track to produce more than 200 million pounds of copper annually.The company is looking to advance studies for potential expansions and long-term development options for its large-scale sulfide resources at Lone Star. It is also ramping up underground production at Grasberg in Indonesia, resulting in a spike in milling rates. The focus on cost management and reduction of debt levels is commendable. Shares of FCX have gained 27% over the past six months.Based in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan is engaged in mineral exploration and development; mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver; and smelting and refining copper concentrates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FCX’s earnings for 2023 has moved up 18% over the past 90 days. FCX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.1%, on average. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Southern Copper: The company has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates world-class assets in investment-grade countries, such as Mexico and Peru. Its constant focus on increasing low-cost production is commendable. SCCO expects copper production in 2023 to reach 926,000 tons, with the Peruvian production coming back on track, and new production at Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista.The company’s capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments at the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico and at the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. It will gain from its efforts to grow in Peru, given that the country is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves. The company's shares have gained 43% in the past six months.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Phoenix, AZ-based company’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 11.8% over the past 60 days. SCCO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7%, on average. The company, which engages in mining, exploring, smelting, and refining copper and other minerals, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

It has previously dropped stocks that don't meet its ESG standards.""Fizzy drinks are not necessarily something that are very much aligned with any of the sustainable development goals,"" Eric Christian Pedersen said in an interview.He also cited worries about future demand for products seen as unhealthy because of their high sugar content.""We've for a long time – other things being equal - been less likely to want to bet on them in the funds that we market as especially responsible or sustainable. But they're not necessarily automatically out, and a good engagement process and trajectory on some of the key issues helps,"" he said.The Coca-Cola Company declined to comment, while Pepsico did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Consumer groups have long worried about the dietary impact of fizzy drinks, while environmental activists have highlighted the impact of single-use petroleum-based plastic bottles and manufacturers' use of sometimes scarce water resources.In 2021, global coalition Break Free From Plastic named Coca-Cola as the world's worst plastic polluter for the fourth year in a row.Coca-Cola said last year it aimed for 25% of its packaging globally to be reusable by 2030, up from 16% in 2020.PepsiCo said in 2021 that it aimed to reduce virgin plastic per serving across all brands by 50% by 2030 and focus on healthier food, and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 2040.NO EXCLUSIONNorway's largest pension fund KLP said it has not cut its stake in fizzy drinks makers over concerns about ESG issues but that ""plastic consumption is a big issue, as are waste and the circular economy when it comes to their business"".Story continuesCoca-Cola Europacific Partners bottles and sells Coca-Cola products in Western Europe, Australia, Indonesia and New Zealand. It has had ""very open discussions with Nordic investors in particular"" on various issues, finance chief Nik Jhangiani said in an interview.""Sometimes I don't think they fully have in the past appreciated what we're doing,"" he said.NAM, which manages around 239 billion euros ($254 billion) in assets across a range of strategies, had discussed its concerns with both Coca-Cola and Pepsico, Pedersen said.""The more they can ensure that their packaging was recycled and did not end up in landfill - that their water use did not harm local populations and so on - the more positive the outlook on them would be,"" he said.Nordic financial groups have been at the forefront of ESG-investing and past actions, like pulling out of some tobacco, coal and oil companies, have been followed by some other funds.In 2020, NAM excluded shares of Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA worth about 40 million euros from all its funds, based on the company's environmental record and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Referring to Nordic investors' reduced interest in fizzy drinks companies, Bernstein analyst Callum Elliot said: ""This triggers uncomfortable memories of the de-rating suffered by tobacco stocks. Could beverage companies be the next in line?""But Pedersen said Nordea will continue to invest in those that make the best efforts to improve their ESG credentials.""Do you want to exclude everything that smells bad, or do you want to go into individual sectors and industries and try and find some ESG high-performers that can help move the industry?"" he said.($1 = 0.9406 euros)(Reporting by Richa Naidu in London and Gwladys Fouche in Oslo; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Catherine Evans)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Income-generating stocks are all the rage as the stock market suffered huge losses last year. According to a report by Reuters, Wall Street recorded its biggest annual drop in 2022 since the financial crisis of 2008, as the S&amp;P 500 shed nearly $8 trillion in market cap. Growth stocks also recorded their worst performance in a decade, turning investors’ attention toward overlooked dividend equities.Quality companies that have raised their payouts for a significant period are considered safe during fluctuating market conditions. Historical analysis of these stocks shows that they have outperformed their peers when turbulence in the market occurs. Over the past five decades, dividend growers have surpassed other asset classes when inflation ranged between 4% to 13% annually, as reported by Sterling Capital. Another reason why dividends make reliable investments is due to the compounding effects of dividend income and price appreciation. According to a report by Schroders, the average annual return across eight markets was 4.3% in the last 25 years, which increased to an average of 7.1% including reinvested dividends.Analysts often advise investing in companies that have proven track records of dividend growth, as these companies are likely to continue growing their payouts in the long term. In addition to this, such companies are considered less risky as they have stable cash flows and histories of profitability. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some major dividend companies with solid dividend growth streaks and strong balance sheets. In view of this, we will discuss the best consistent dividend stocks to buy in this article.Story continues16 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for at least 10 years.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We believe shorting furniture retailers has arguably become a consensus view on the back of widely known tough comps from early 2021 (+26% and +40% SSS Comps for WSM in calendar Q1/Q2 ‘21) and fear of pull forward of demand, which seems to be corroborated by weak credit card data in the category the last few weeks and a poor outlook from furniture e-Commerce giant Wayfair, not to mention a panic-inducing, rambling conference call from the oft colorful CEO of Restoration Hardware. Lazy thematic macro analysis that stops there, however, paints an incomplete picture of what has transpired at many individual companies like WSM that have been deemed COVID beneficiaries that are now at all-time low valuations.WSM is a furniture and home décor retailer that owns several well-known brands: William Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Rejuvenation, Mark &amp; Graham, and most importantly, west elm. While perhaps thought of as a dying mall-based brick &amp; mortar retailer, WSM derives the vast majority (66%+) of its revenue from e-Commerce and has been a remarkably steady performer, remaining free cash flow positive every year since at least 2007 and achieving positive same store sales comps since 2010, including +17% in 2020, +22% in 2021 with guidance for a further mid-to-high single digit growth again this year. Within the overall positive sales trends, west elm’s consistent growth has been even more impressive, with a 16% average annual same-store sales growth rate since 2012. To little fanfare, by our calculation, WSM has become the single highest quality retailer in public markets with a 58% return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2021 and a 39% ROIC on average over the past 3 years…” (Click here to see the full text)14.

This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)10. Waste Management, Inc.

It may seem strange to sell a position with this backdrop, but I did so for two reasons. First, it was purchased in the first place as a reasonably priced defensive during an orgy of speculation. In this context, CASY served its purpose. Second, given the developments of the past year and Upslope’s overall still-defensive portfolio, I think there are better uses of capital today – specifically cheaper, less-defensive longs. Some of these are highlighted in Exhibit 4 below.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles:Top Investors' Stocks Portfolio: Mid-Cap Stocks12 High Growth Software Stocks that are Profitable12 High Growth Healthcare Stocks to BuyDisclosure.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Kevzara® (sarilumab) for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), an inflammatory rheumatic disease, in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate corticosteroid taper.""Polymyalgia rheumatica can be an incapacitating disease, causing painful disease flares in multiple parts of the body that leave people fatigued and unable to fully perform everyday activities. Corticosteroids have been the primary treatment to date, but many patients do not adequately respond to steroids or cannot be tapered off steroids, which puts such patients at risk of complications from long-term steroid therapy,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “With the approval of Kevzara for polymyalgia rheumatica, patients now have an FDA-approved treatment to help offer relief from the disabling symptoms of this disease and long-term dependance on steroids.”The FDA evaluated the Kevzara application for PMR under Priority Review, which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Kevzara was previously approved for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.PMR often initially presents with pain and stiffness around the neck, shoulder and hip area and symptoms include fatigue, low-grade fever and weight loss. Patients often experience flares during tapering of, or relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid (CS) treatment. Patients with PMR report difficulty in carrying out everyday functions such as getting out of bed, standing up from a chair, or lifting their arms. PMR generally affects people who are 50 years and older.Story continues“Until now, people living with polymyalgia rheumatica have had limited treatment options for this serious rheumatic condition, which causes significant pain and discomfort,” said Bill Sibold, Executive Vice President, Head, Specialty Care at Sanofi. “The approval of Kevzara as the first and only biologic for polymyalgia rheumatica is a new option for patients and the healthcare professionals who treat them.”The FDA approval for this additional indication for Kevzara is based on results from the SAPHYR Phase 3 randomized clinical trial in patients with steroid-resistant active PMR, who flared on ≥7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent during taper. In the trial, patients were randomized to receive either Kevzara 200 mg every two weeks along with a 14-week taper of CS (n=60; 1 patient randomized but not treated) or placebo every two weeks along with a 52-week CS taper (n=58). At 52 weeks, the trial met its primary endpoint with 28% of Kevzara-treated patients achieving sustained remission compared to 10% for placebo (p=0.0193). Sustained remission was defined as being in disease remission by week 12, absence of disease flare, C-reactive protein normalization from weeks 12 to 52, and adherence to the CS taper protocol from weeks 12 to 52.A sensitivity analysis removing acute phase reactants (measures of ongoing inflammation) maintained significance (proportion difference for Kevzara vs. placebo: 18%; 95% confidence interval: 3.1 to 32.6) and confirmed the primary outcome. In addition, an analysis of a secondary endpoint showed that the median cumulative CS dose was 777 mg for Kevzara, compared to 2044 mg for placebo.The common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients treated with Kevzara (n=59) were neutropenia (15%), leukopenia (7%), constipation (7%), rash pruritic (5%), myalgia (7%), fatigue (5%), and injection site pruritus (5%). Serious adverse reaction of neutropenia occurred in 2 patients (3%) in the Kevzara group compared to none in the placebo group (n=58). In both cases of neutropenia, the participants had a neutrophil count less than 500 per mm3 without any infections; neutropenia resolved following permanent discontinuation of study drug. The most common adverse reactions that resulted in permanent discontinuation of therapy with Kevzara were neutropenia occurring in 3 patients (5%) and infection in 3 separate patients (5%), including COVID-19 (n=1), intervertebral discitis (n=1), and pneumonia (n=1).Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Kevzara gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need. KevzaraConnect®, a comprehensive and specialized program that provides support services to patients throughout every step of the treatment process, can help eligible patients who are uninsured, lack coverage, or need copay assistance. Additionally, KevzaraConnect offers support from registered nurses and other specialists who are available 24/7 to speak with patients and help them navigate the complex insurance process.

Kevzara, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is an immune system protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity, joint destruction and other systemic problems.Sarilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).U.S. Indications and Important Safety Information                                             KEVZARA® (sarilumab) is an injectable prescription medicine called an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor blocker. KEVZARA is used to treat adult patients with:moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after at least one other medicine called a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) has been used and did not work well or could not be tolerated.polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) after corticosteroids have been used and did not work well or when a slow decrease in the dose of corticosteroids (taper) cannot be tolerated.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONKEVZARA can cause serious side effects including:SERIOUS INFECTIONS: KEVZARA is a medicine that affects your immune system.

With Q4HE's support, Primary Care of Southwest Georgia (PCSG)-an FQHC providing healthcare services to families-will open its second school-based health center. There, it will deploy mobile COVID-19 testing as well as provide general healthcare services for students and their families.In addition to wellness screenings, chronic disease screenings, and other routine health services, PCSG plans to expand COVID-19 testing, vaccine access, and educational efforts with a focus on public housing sites, church events, and underserved populations in the Early County area of southwest Georgia. Q4HE's support will also fund the purchase of a van to ensure that a lack of transportation is never a barrier to families seeking care at one of PCSG's clinics.""The day we received the Q4HE grant was one of the most rewarding days I've had as CEO of PCSG. We've worked with Quest Diagnostics for more than 10 years, and our partnership has allowed our sliding-scale patients to receive critical lab work at a discounted rate. Now we're able to open a site at a school that serves a predominantly low-income community, and we're purchasing a van to transport students from across the area so they can get medical care without their parents having to take off a day of work.

The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and its tactical approaches to accelerate growth also buoy optimism. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and a soft volume environment are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 5.1% against the 17.5% decline of the industry and the 9.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of diagnostic information services has a market capitalization of $15.44 billion. The company projects 2.4% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Quest Diagnostics surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 7%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Base Volume Improves: We are optimistic about Quest Diagnostics’ base testing volumes or base business, which refers to testing volumes excluding COVID-19 testing. The company is increasing its efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in the base business. Quest Diagnostics continued to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2022.Accelerate Growth Strategy Bodes Well: Quest Diagnostics continues to progress in terms of its tactical approaches to accelerate growth, the first part of its two-point strategy, raising our optimism. In terms of growth through M&amp;A, the company has announced an outreach lab purchase from Ohio-based Summa Health. Quest Diagnostics has also announced a professional lab services relationship with Southwest Florida-based Lee Health to provide supply-chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee Health and selected outpatient centers.To accelerate growth through health plan access, the company continued to gain traction with value-based contracts, where it sees higher growth than traditional contracts.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: Quest Diagnostics’ better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 earnings and revenues buoy our optimism. During the reported quarter, the base business registered growth and the company has also ramped up investments to accelerate growth in the base business, particularly in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing.DownsidesStiff Competition: Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market, compared to Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including the accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs primarily based on the quality of service.Soft Volume Environment: Pressure on volume, owing to a difficult macroeconomic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, was down 11.2% year over year in the fourth quarter. Revenues per requisition declined 5.1% year over year due to lower COVID-19 molecular testing volume.Estimate TrendQuest Diagnostics has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 2.7% north to $8.69.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.20 billion, suggesting a 15.6% decline from the year-ago reported number.This compares to our first-quarter 2023 revenue estimate of $2.20 billion, suggesting a 15.7% plunge from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, McKesson Corporation MCK and Avanos Medical, Inc. AVNS.Hologic, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 15.2%.

426,6317a737-ed77-3252-993d-9abf1e185482,AMP,2023-03-01,4 GARP Stocks to Scoop Up for Maximum Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-garp-stocks-scoop-maximum-132401671.html,1677590641,STORY,"['AMP', 'EWBC', 'GWW']","[Growth at a reasonable price, or GARP, is an excellent strategy to earn quick investment profits. The GARP approach helps identify stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and others.Therefore, a portfolio based on the GARP strategy contains stocks that offer the best value and growth investing. Ameriprise Financial AMP, W.W. Grainger GWW, East West Bancorp EWBC and Bloomin’ Brands BLMN are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects regarding cash flow, revenues, EPS and others.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric considered by growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though the investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Story continuesScreening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS &amp; projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared with the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are four of the six stocks that made it through the screen:Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company that offers a wide range of products and services focused on financial planning and advice.

428,2bb6896c-e876-3d4a-881b-b091ff8bc224,CSCO,2023-03-01,50 Biggest Public Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/50-biggest-public-companies-world-181103677.html,1677607863,STORY,"['KO', 'AVGO', 'ABBV', 'PFE', 'CVX', 'AZN', 'CSCO', 'BABA', 'ORCL', 'MRK']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 50 biggest public companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 biggest public companies in the world.While much maligned, and often rightly so, the biggest public companies in the world aren't just intrinsically linked to economic growth and development, but also to the significant improvement in quality of life that mankind has enjoyed in the last few decades. This is why most countries in the world attempt to provide incentives and tax breaks to companies because of the economic improvements and jobs that such corporations provide.So what is the main difference between a public and a private company? A private company is generally owned by founders, management or private investors. On the other hand, a public company has at least a significant portion of its shares held by the general public, also known as free float. This percentage depends on the regulations of a country but is generally at least 25%, which means that the founders may still control the company even if is listed. When a company starts to grow significantly and needs more capital, it offers its shares to the publics in an initial public offering, or IPO, by getting listed on a stock exchange, and you can easily learn more about the biggest IPOs of all time.25 biggest public companies in the worldPhoto by Campaign Creators on UnsplashBecause a public company's shares are owned by the general public, the regulations that it must follow are much more stringent than for private companies, including publishing annual reports, quarterly reports, any material information updates, ESG and much more. The biggest public companies in the world are worth more than the GDP of most nations worldwide, so you can understand the power and influence that these companies possess.While there are some countries without stock exchanges, most have a stock exchange, or even multiple, with more than 40,000 companies listed globally. Of these, only 10% are located in the U.S., but because of its advanced economy and favorable laws and regulations, the vast majority of the biggest public companies in the world are located there. Overall, Asia has the largest number of listed companies which account for close to 37% of the global market value. Because of the recent appreciation in the U.S. dollar, U.S. companies are more dominant than ever in terms of market capitalization. An interesting statistic according to the Organization of Economically Developed Countries in 2019 was that in half of the global listed companies, just three holders held more than 50% of the capital, showing the concentration of both influence and wealth.Story continuesThe biggest public companies in the world have a total market cap of over $22.5 trillion, more than a fifth of the global GDP in 2021, according to the World Bank. These companies dominate the industries they are in and come from a variety of sectors, though tech companies are present thoroughly throughout the list. To determine the largest listed companies, we checked their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance, and where the company was listed on a foreign stock exchange, converted the number to USD for consistency.

Each blog highlights a different Cisco employee whose work positively impacts people, communities, or the planet. The series was formerly known as people behind Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at Cisco.The Purpose Report and ESG Reporting Hub, are where Cisco describes our initiatives focused on our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All. This includes our goals and progress on the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics that are important to our stakeholders and where we highlight our impact over the last fiscal year. Setting clear public goals, measuring our progress against them, and reporting on that progress annually is how we hold ourselves accountable to our stakeholders and society. We have been publicly reporting our performance on ESG topics since 2005.So how is comprehensive reporting on our purpose and ESG initiatives put together at Cisco? Meet Amanda Cumberland, Director of ESG Strategy and Reporting, Insights, and Impact at Cisco, who leads the creation of our Purpose Report and the ESG Reporting Hub. She shares her academic background in research and statistics, her passion for measuring impact, and how people inside and outside of Cisco help drive our purpose.Please tell me a bit about your life before joining Cisco.Amanda: I moved to Arizona for graduate school. My goal at the time was to work in academia and I thought I would be a research professor. I published articles in different empirical journals because we had a massive research lab. My graduate advisor secured a lot of grants, and we did all kinds of great research.My focus was on social and developmental psychology and studying how children develop emotions and personalities with an emphasis on statistics. Understanding people is complex and the statistical techniques had to be equally complex. We were lucky to have some of the best statistics professors in the country.Story continuesWhat brought you to Cisco, and what are your job responsibilities now?Amanda: My first job at Cisco fell in my lap toward the end of my Ph.D. program. I only had experience working in academia, so I never imagined a job in the corporate world. I knew a student in our research lab who had been recruited to work for Cisco to do assessment data and analysis and she suggested I come and work for Cisco to help measure the impact of the Networking Academy and other programs.Sometimes in life you have those sliding door moments where you can go one way or the other, and I chose to do something completely different. They were looking for someone who knew a specific statistics technique to help define and measure the impact of Networking Academy and I was excited to apply my skills for something that was having such a global impact.It was great because I got to help create something from scratch. We focused on defining and measuring the impact of the Networking Academy and we were able to create and execute on a complete end-to-end measurement plan, and conduct predictive modeling which is still used to measure the impact of the program.I had another new opportunity at Cisco when they created a strategy team in Corporate Affairs under Mary de Wysocki. This role was exciting as I was able to create and work on many thought-leadership and market research projects to inform our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy holistically along with key insights for improving programs, measuring impact, and creating new initiatives.Measuring impact is one of my passions. The two roles morphed into having more of a centralized team around anything metrics or research-related, and a few years ago, ESG Reporting was added to the team. I'm in my third year of having the privilege to lead the creation of our annual Purpose Report and ESG Hub. The focus on ESG has accelerated in recent years and I'm very proud of all the amazing work that Cisco does to help Power an Inclusive Future for All.Can you share more about what it takes to create the Purpose Report?Amanda: Between January and late March, we conduct multiple analyses, benchmarking and create our ESG materiality analysis which includes inputs from our key stakeholders to help guide our focus areas, initiatives, and reporting. And, of course, we do the benchmarking all year round because of the ever-changing landscape. Many new research reports come out in January. We also use these reports to understand what is happening in the world, such as global challenges including Ukraine or the pandemic, the economic outlook, purpose and ESG trends, technology trends, among a few to help guide our efforts and reporting.Next, we develop a recommended reporting strategy because that leads to how we identify the right subject matter experts (SMEs) for those topic areas across the company. It's a massive effort, with 40 teams and over 160 SMEs participating this past year. There are teams such as legal, finance, supply chain, circular economy, Workplace Resources, employee engagement, and more. There are so many groups because we want to get it right. We do a kickoff meeting toward the end of June, and we share the reporting strategy, the process, the timelines, the expectations, and how we're structuring it.We start conducting deep dives with SMEs in early July to understand the progress we made that year on key commitments and important areas of focus to highlight. We guide them based on all the frameworks we follow, inquiries we receive, ESG-focused indices, and other areas of focus to cover in the reporting. The team pulls all that all together into an outline at the beginning of the new fiscal year and will start gathering data about progress toward our goals. We also have a thorough data documentation claims review process, through which we work with SMEs to substantiate the claims with quality backup, and work closely with the finance and legal team throughout the process.Why is it important for Cisco to share what we are doing annually when it comes to our Purpose work?Amanda: It's important to share the fantastic work Cisco's doing towards our purpose for many reasons, including the expectations of our stakeholders both internally and externally. Investors increasingly make investment decisions based on a company's ESG commitments and initiatives. And our customers are making more decisions about who to work with based on their ESG policies, commitments, and initiatives. Also, we know people decide where to work based on our environmental and social track record. Current employees tend to stay because of a company's purpose, and for future employees, our reporting could be an important aspect of their decision to work with us.Cisco has a long history of reporting on our ESG topics and we want to continue to be a leader in this space and continue to transparently share our progress and our best practices that could inspire other companies to do more so we can have even more collective impact.The theme for this year's report is Purpose Personified. Can you tell me more about why that theme was chosen?Amanda: We landed on Purpose Personified because everyone is part of achieving Cisco's purpose. Not only across the different business units, but there are also people we interact with through our partnerships and programs that exemplify all this amazing work. For example, you can read more about Agnes Chege, who, after experiencing a layoff early in the pandemic, found a new career in cybersecurity through Cisco Networking Academy. The report also shares how Allison Wolff, co-founder of Vibrant Planet, a Cisco Foundation funding recipient, uses data to address catastrophic fires. And you'll be inspired by Cisco employees like Scott McGregor, Lead for Cisco Social Justice Action 8, who is working to bring connectivity to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).We wanted to showcase our progress through their eyes, too, because we can only achieve our purpose through the people driving the work forward and making a positive impact.For people who read the 2022 Purpose Report, what key takeaways do you hope they will walk away with?Amanda: I hope one of the takeaways is that Cisco is doing so much, and all these important topics and this work has always been part of Cisco's DNA. Whether it's human rights, environmental sustainability, circular economy, education, health and well-being, or responding to crises, we're using our differentiation as a company, the power of technology, and the power of our extended network of customers and partners to make a difference across all these areas.When you read the Purpose Report, I hope you also take away the breadth and depth of everything we're doing as a company and are as proud as I am of the impact we have had and that we will continue to make a difference for people and the world.And lastly, I hope you see our efforts and reporting to be transparent. We don't have it all figured out yet, but we want to keep learning and doing more. We hope others learn from us too so that we can continuously improve and have even more impact over time.To learn more about our progress to power a more inclusive future, visit our Cisco ESG Reporting Hub, where you can read our 2022 Cisco Purpose Report.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/741219/People-Behind-Purpose-at-Cisco-How-a-Passion-for-Measuring-Impact-Led-to-a-Leadership-Role-in-ESG-Reporting]"
