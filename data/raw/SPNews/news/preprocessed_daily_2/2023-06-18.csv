In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at PVH (NYSE:PVH) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for PVH, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.095 = US$860m ÷ (US$11b - US$2.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Therefore, PVH has an ROCE of 9.5%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Luxury industry average of 16%. View our latest analysis for PVH roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PVH compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PVH here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?Over the past five years, PVH's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if PVH doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.The Bottom Line On PVH's ROCEIn a nutshell, PVH has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 44% in the last five years. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.Story continuesPVH does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for PVH  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

1,f793f341-4657-34fd-a211-52f4b028c94f,TMO,2023-06-18,"Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) jumps 3.7% this week, though earnings growth is still tracking behind five-year shareholder returns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-tmo-120040002.html,1687089640,STORY,['TMO'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) stock is up an impressive 157% over the last five years. And in the last week the share price has popped 3.7%. But this could be related to the buoyant market which is up about 2.4% in a week.Since the stock has added US$7.4b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Thermo Fisher Scientific managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 21% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Thermo Fisher Scientific's TSR for the last 5 years was 160%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThermo Fisher Scientific shareholders are up 7.5% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 21% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

A shadowy hacktivist group claimed responsibility, saying it flooded the sites with junk traffic in distributed denial-of-service attacks.Initially reticent to name the cause, Microsoft has now disclosed that DDoS attacks by the murky upstart were indeed to blame.But the software giant has offered few details — and did not immediately comment on how many customers were affected and whether the impact was global. A spokeswoman confirmed that the group that calls itself Anonymous Sudan was behind the attacks. It claimed responsibility on its Telegram social media channel at the time. Some security researchers believe the group to be Russian.Microsoft’s explanation in a blog post Friday evening followed a request by The Associated Press two days earlier. Slim on details, the post said the attacks “temporarily impacted availability” of some services. It said the attackers were focused on “disruption and publicity” and likely used rented cloud infrastructure and virtual private networks to bombard Microsoft servers from so-called botnets of zombie computers around the globe.Microsoft said there was no evidence any customer data was accessed or compromised.While DDoS attacks are mainly a nuisance — making websites unreachable without penetrating them — security experts say they can disrupt the work of millions if they successfully interrupt the services of a software service giant like Microsoft on which so much global commerce depends.It's not clear if that's what happened here.“We really have no way to measure the impact if Microsoft doesn’t provide that info,” said Jake Williams, a prominent cybersecurity researcher and a former National Security Agency offensive hacker. Williams said he was not aware of Outlook previously being attacked at this scale.Story continues“We know some resources were inaccessible for some, but not others. This often happens with DDoS of globally distributed systems,” Williams added. He said Microsoft's apparent unwillingness to provide an objective measure of customer impact “probably speaks to the magnitude.”Microsoft dubbed the attackers Storm-1359, using a designator it assigns to groups whose affiliation it has not yet established. Cybersecurity sleuthing tends to take time — and even then can be a challenge if the adversary is skilled.Pro-Russian hacking groups including Killnet — which the cybersecurity firm Mandiant says is Kremlin-affiliated — have been bombarding government and other websites of Ukraine's allies with DDoS attacks. In October, some U.S. airport sites were hit. Analyst Alexander Leslie of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said it's unlikely Anonymous Sudan is located as it claims in Sudan, an African country. The group works closely with Killnet and other pro-Kremlin groups to spread pro-Russian propaganda and disinformation, he said.Edward Amoroso, NYU professor and CEO of TAG Cyber, said the Microsoft incident highlights how DDoS attacks remain “a significant risk that we all just agree to avoid talking about. It’s not controversial to call this an unsolved problem.” (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)He said Microsoft's difficulties fending of this particular attack suggest “a single point of failure.” The best defense against these attacks is to distribute a service massively, on a content distribution network for example.Indeed, the techniques the attackers used are not old, said U.K. security researcher Kevin Beaumont. “One dates back to 2009,” he said.Serious impacts from the Microsoft 365 office suite interruptions were reported on Monday June 5, peaking at 18,000 outage and problem reports on the tracker Downdetector shortly after 11 a.m. Eastern time.On Twitter that day, Microsoft said Outlook, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business were affected.Attacks continued through the week, with Microsoft confirming on June 9 that its Azure cloud computing platform had been affected.On June 8, the computer security news site BleepingComputer.com reported that cloud-based OneDrive file-hosting was down globally for a time.Microsoft said at the time that desktop OneDrive clients were not affected, BleepingComputer reported.]"

This follows F1’s return to the US with a semi-permanent race in Austin, and two races in Miami which began last year.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study American International Group's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for American International Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for American International Group is:14% = US$6.6b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.14 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.American International Group's Earnings Growth And 14% ROETo begin with, American International Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 9.8%. Probably as a result of this, American International Group was able to see an impressive net income growth of 57% over the last five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared American International Group's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 14%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is AIG worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether AIG is currently mispriced by the market.Is American International Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?American International Group's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 9.7%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 90% of its profits. So it looks like American International Group is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, American International Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 21% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 10% over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that American International Group's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

This follows F1’s return to the US with a semi-permanent race in Austin, and two races in Miami which began last year. Brown notes F1’s success has led to a new TV contract in the US with ESPN, with ratings still relatively strong.This of course has led to blue-chip US companies like Oracle, Chipotle, Workday, and AutoNation joining the sponsorship ranks.Brown, who cut his teeth bringing in sponsors for various race teams he worked for after his career as a racer, has seen McLaren boost its sponsorship numbers tremendously since he took the reins a few years back.

Amidst this ebb and flow, it’s imperative to consider the top blue-chip stocks to buy. These stocks are sturdy pillars supporting the business landscape’s most influential and relevant names. However, it’s important to consider that not all blue-chip stocks are created equal.The secret lies in identifying the ones that, although beaten down, hold the promise of resurgence. These are the high-potential blue-chip stocks not yet swept up in the valuation tide that leaves many stocks trading at a premium. Hence, keeping your eyes peeled for these blue-chip stocks at low prices is important. That said,  in curating the buy blue-chip stocks now list, I’ve gone for blue-chips trading at more than 50% lower than their 10-year high prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsShopify (SHOP)Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockDespite experiencing turbulence over the past year due to post-pandemic shifts and other challenges, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is back again, asserting its market dominance. The e-commerce heavyweight recently revealed a 25.8% surge in first-quarter sales, reaching an impressive $1.51 billion.Moreover, the company’s gross merchandise volume experienced a robust 15% boost to $49.6 billion and, on a constant currency basis, a solid 18% leap. Add to that a 10% increase in monthly recurring revenue, sitting comfortably at $116 million compared to the prior year. Shopify’s forward-looking stance is equally encouraging, with forecasts of second-quarter revenue growth to mimic its first-quarter bump last year while maintaining a similar gross margin percentage.In a strategic move, Shopify has chosen to pivot away from logistics focusing on its strength, its software-as-a-service offerings. Therefore, all signs indicate that Shopify is set to continue being the go-to solution, powering businesses of all sizes.Story continuesHalliburton Company (HAL)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockHalliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is a stalwart in the energy sector, which continues to showcase its mettle as a potential frontrunner for the next rally. However, there’s a caveat, the oil services juggernaut needs the drilling landscape to pick up the pace. Nevertheless, despite China’s reopening not sparking much interest, other factors are lining up to create a bullish outlook for oil prices. The necessity to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the potential pause in interest rate hikes, and OPEC’s additional production cut are all stacking up favorably.Moreover, Halliburton recently released robust first-quarter results. The company kicked off the first quarter, increasing revenues by 33% year-over-year to $5.7 billion. With clients eager to ramp up oil and gas production, the company’s outlook for the year remains optimistic. As the energy landscape evolves, Halliburton seems poised to ride the wave of growth and opportunity.Kinder Morgan (KMI)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is one of North America’s largest infrastructure companies and a titan in the realm of oil and gas pipelines and terminals. Its financial stability and rising cash flows have positioned it to foster robust dividend growth. However, it isn’t merely resting on its laurels. It’s aligning with the broader energy sector’s pivot towards lower carbon sources, a strategic shift that could unlock significant growth opportunities.In the past, Kinder Morgan grappled with a low-interest coverage ratio and high debt resulting in a dividend cut in 2016. However, since then, the firm has stood on much stronger ground, as the revised payout is significantly more secure, with it looking to invest in growth projects and joint ventures in 2023. Moreover, these investments are funded through internally generated cash flow, eliminating the need to access capital markets.The company’s distributable cash flow per share is projected to be around $2.13 in 2023, with a steady upward trajectory over the next half-decade thanks to growth projects and share repurchases. Its trailing twelve-month cash flows of $1.6 billion stand will continue to support its lofty shareholder rewards.Newmont Corporation (NEM)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) remains a star in the realm of gold stocks, boasting an impressive 3.8% dividend yield with over 35% growth over a 5-year period. The firm’s potential shines even brighter when we consider that gold prices might oscillate between $2,500 and $4,000 annually. Looming recession fears and uncertainty over interest rates could propel this surge.This gold rush could translate into a cash waterfall for Newmont. The company forecasts a $400 million hike in free cash flow for every $100 increase in the price of gold. Imagine a $500 upswing in gold prices could result in a whopping $2 billion boost in incremental free cash flows annually. This financial windfall will inflate dividends and beef up the company’s credit metrics.Newmont is also charting a course to trim down its all-in-sustaining cost, which will nudge EBITDA margins upwards, regardless of whether gold prices plateau post-rally. Additionally, their recent $20 billion acquisition of Newcrest Mining is likely to bolster the company’s gold reserves further and diversify its production towards copper.Kraft Heinz (KHC)Source: ShutterstockKraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC)  has been killing it with its quarterlies, outpacing the broader market by a hefty margin. The pandemic proved a boon for the firm as customers stocked pantries and feasted at home. The firm continues to shine, offering investors incredible value among its consumer staples peers.The food and beverage powerhouse has a formidable brand portfolio and a global expansion strategy, positioning it for sustained growth. Its financial track record is a testament to its strength, boasting consistent sales growth, solid profitability, and a tantalizingly affordable valuation to its peers.The company’s recent full-year forecast upgrade reflects its solid first-quarter performance and the anticipated easing of supply chain and transportation costs. An impressive 10.3% year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA, which clocked in at $1.48 billion, surpassed analyst expectations by a sizeable margin. Analysts say its efficiency gains and margin improvements are likely the driving forces behind the raised guidance.JD.com (JD)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockChinese stocks such as e-commerce titan JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) have taken a beating at the stock market over the past couple of years. Going public nearly a decade ago, these businesses have effectively skyrocketed, amassing sales of a hefty $67 billion in 2018 to a staggering $152 billion last year.Yes, the dragon of the East has faced some major headwinds. The Chinese economy, battered by the coronavirus and extended slowdowns, witnessed fluctuating fortunes for eCommerce firms like JD. However, in the past couple of quarters, we are seeing the seeds of a comeback. Analysts project a robust 4% revenue surge this year, followed by a double-digit top-line rebound in 2024. Consequently, JD’s stock, selling at a mere 0.4 times forward sales estimates, it is an undervalued treasure chest waiting to be unlocked.Adding to the excitement, Richard Liu, the company’s founder, resumes a hands-on role; JD could power through tumultuous post-pandemic waves toward prosperous shores.Cloudflare (NET)Source: ShutterstockCloudflare (NYSE:NET) is one of the top undervalued tech stocks to put on your watch list, offering a promising opportunity in the rapidly growing content delivery networks (CDNs) sector. CDNs, local data servers positioned near end-users, enable faster content delivery and protect against cyber attacks.

You’re looking for a sure thing, or at least as sure as you can be when talking about the stock market. What you’re looking for are A-rated stocks to buy.The “A” rating from the Portfolio Grader means that the stock is among the best. The Portfolio Grader rates stocks on an “A” through “F” scale, taking into account earnings performance, momentum, analyst sentiment and quantitative measurements.And these stocks are relatively safe choices. Besides having top grades from the Portfolio Grader, these safe stocks should have consistent earnings and cash flow, even if the market should turn downward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you’re approaching retirement or are concerned about today’s economic climate, you’ll want to consider high-performing A-rated stocks. Here are seven from which to choose.Ferrari (RACE)Ferarri car on the streets of France.Source: Hadrian / ShutterstockYou may not think Ferrari (NASDAQ:RACE), the maker of high-performance sports cars, is safe. But RACE stock is an excellent investment these days. The stock is up nearly 40% this year, and I think more will come.Even though Ferrari is more of an old-school automotive stock (rather one that’s diving into the electric vehicle race), shares are in high demand. Ferrari’s vehicle deliveries last quarter were up 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues were up 20.5%. And earnings per share were up 25%.And as Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas argues, Ferrari is a defensive play because of its strong pricing power and a long order backlog. Even if the economy sours, RACE should continue to do well.RACE stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comChipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at the forefront of artificial intelligence. Nvidia’s shocking guidance for the second quarter, increasing its revenue target from $7.2 billion to $11 billion, fueled the runup in recent weeks of AI stocks.Story continuesThe rise of tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, powered by Nvidia technology, is leading to a massive increase in demand from computing and generative AI end users. And that’s playing right into the pockets of Nvidia shareholders.NVDA stock is up 165% so far this year, and with its strong guidance, I expect it will easily withstand a downturn in the market.Nivida has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Oracle (ORCL)A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.comOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a computing company too. And while it’s not nearly as exciting as Nivida’s AI advances, Oracle is in fine shape.Revenue for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 was a gain of 45% from a year ago, reaching $4.1 billion. That’s helped push Oracle stock up about 30% in 2023.Wall Street wants to see that momentum continue for the fiscal fourth quarter, which Oracle is scheduled to release after the market closes today. Analysts expect Oracle to see revenue growth between 17% and 19% and earnings per share between $1.56 and $1.60.Q3 revenue was inflated because Oracle bought Cerner, a healthcare software company, last year. That’s why the Q4 numbers are down to a more reasonable level.Oracle is a solid, safe pick here – particularly if it avoids unpleasant surprises in its earnings report. ORCL has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Netflix (NFLX)Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production companySource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comStreaming services company Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) might be my favorite safety stock right now. Because the company has a great product, loyal customers – and it’s finally taking steps to monetize them.Netflix is finally cracking down on password sharing in its customer base. You can still share your password with someone who doesn’t live in your home. But you’ll get billed an extra $8 per month.About 43% of Netflix’s customers share passwords, or about 100 million customers. Even if it gets 10% of those customers to pay an extra $8 per month, that’s close to an additional $1 billion in revenue.That’s important money to have as Netflix works on creating more original content to keep up and fend off other streaming services.NFLX stock is up 35% this year and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Crocs (CROX)The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.Source: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.comCrocs (NASDAQ:CROX) footwear probably isn’t for everyone. And that’s fine. They came out originally as a kind of boating shoe and resembled clogs more than anything.But there’s absolutely no reason you can’t be comfortable holding CROX stock. I think it’s a fine defensive play right now.Crocs made $884 million in revenue in the first quarter, gaining nearly 34%. And it also recorded an EPS of $2.61. On both counts, it handily beat analysts’ expectations.Crocs isn’t a one-horse show anymore, either. Last year it completed its purchase of HeyDude, an Italian casual footwear maker.Crocs is also pretty cheap, with a price-to-earnings ratio of only 11.

The aviation company had already withstood a downturn of its own because supply chain issues prevented the company from making new jets.But those problems appear to be going away. The aviation company is increasing the monthly production of the 787 Dreamliner from three jets to four. And it’s installing a second production line at its plant in South Carolina.Boeing is now trading at near 52-week highs as the market gets more confident that this will be a busy travel season and airlines will have powerful incentives to build out or upgrade their fleets.BA stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Casino stocks in Macau, China.

The hospitality and entertainment company, with significant interests in Las Vegas and Macau, should bounce higher from a busy travel season at its resorts.Barclays says that WYNN stock could have an upside of 30% this year. The first quarter results also pointed in that direction – Wynn reported revenue of $1.42 billion, an increase of more than 49% from the previous year.With the memories of Covid-19 lockdowns fresh in their memories, people are more willing than ever to get out and experience the world.

17,71d37049-a5ed-3769-aeb0-6e1838e6d2ca,ZTS,2023-06-18,Does Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-zoetis-nyse-zts-healthy-120021220.html,1687089621,STORY,"['ZTS', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis How Much Debt Does Zoetis Carry?As you can see below, Zoetis had US$6.59b of debt, at March 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$2.11b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$4.48b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Zoetis' Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Zoetis had liabilities of US$1.92b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$7.35b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$2.11b in cash and US$1.19b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$5.97b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Story continuesGiven Zoetis has a humongous market capitalization of US$78.9b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Zoetis has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.4. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 19.2 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. While Zoetis doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Zoetis's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Zoetis produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 58% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewThe good news is that Zoetis's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is good too. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Zoetis takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Zoetis  that you should be aware of.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

18,b6eb6ab2-e94b-3b07-b6c6-681200b3f822,MA,2023-06-18,"With 88% ownership, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/88-ownership-mastercard-incorporated-nyse-120017007.html,1687089617,STORY,['MA'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Mastercard's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 18 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyIf you want to know who really controls Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 88% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Mastercard, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mastercard?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Mastercard already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Mastercard's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. The company's largest shareholder is The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm, with ownership of 11%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.2% and 6.9% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MastercardThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Mastercard Incorporated. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$374m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Mastercard. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Mastercard  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine QUALCOMM’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Is QUALCOMM Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 7.0% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy QUALCOMM today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $131.98, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since QUALCOMM’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will QUALCOMM generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for QUALCOMM, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Currently, QCOM appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QCOM for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on QCOM should the price fluctuate below its true value.If you'd like to know more about QUALCOMM as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

Boeing released its 2023 Commercial Market Outlook (CMO), the company's forecast of 20-year demand for commercial airplanes and services, in advance of the Paris Air Show.The new CMO comes three years after the pandemic grounded most of the global fleet. Key findings include:Passenger traffic continuing to outpace global economic growth of 2.6%.The global fleet nearly doubling to 48,600 jets, expanding 3.5% per year.Airlines replacing about half of the global fleet with new, more fuel-efficient models.""The aviation industry has demonstrated resilience and adaptability after unprecedented disruption, with airlines responding to challenges, simplifying their fleets, improving efficiency and capitalizing on resurgent demand,"" said Brad McMullen, Boeing senior vice president of Commercial Sales and Marketing. ""Looking to the future of air travel, our 2023 CMO reflects further evolution of passenger traffic tied to global growth of the middle class, investments in sustainability, continued growth for low-cost carriers, and air cargo demand to serve evolving supply chains and express cargo delivery.""Boeing's projections for regional demand and key trends through 2042 include:Asia-Pacific markets to represent more than 40% of global demand with half of that total in China.South Asia's fleet will expand more than 7% annually, the world's fastest rate, with India accounting for more than 90% of the region's passenger traffic.North America and Europe each will account for about 20% of global demand.Low-cost carriers will operate more than 40% of the single-aisle fleet in 2042, up from 10% 20 years ago.After omitting demand for Russia and Central Asia in last year's CMO due to uncertainty in the region, this year's forecast covers Russia and Central Asia in the Eurasia region, which comprises about 3% of the global fleet by 2042.Commercial Services forecasts a total served market worth $3.8 trillion, including digital solutions that increase efficiency and reduce cost; robust demand for parts and supply chain solutions; growing maintenance and modification options; and effective training to enhance safety and support the pilot and technician pipeline.Story continuesAlso in the 20-year forecast period, Boeing anticipates demand for these models:New single-aisle airplanes will account for more than 75% of all new deliveries, up slightly from the 2022 outlook, and totaling more than 32,000 airplanes.New widebody jets will be nearly 20% of deliveries, with more than 7,400 airplanes enabling airlines to open new markets and serve existing routes more efficiently.Air cargo will continue to outpace global trade growth, with carriers requiring 2,800 dedicated freighters.

About half of new jet deliveries will replace older models, while the other half will grow airlines' fleets, Boeing predicts.""The end of the recovery has played out largely as we've expected, with a few different nuances and dynamics,"" such as a reduction in demand for regional jets compared to last year as interest in narrowbody planes grows, Hulst said.Boeing expects the global aircraft fleet to almost double over the next 20 years, from about 24,500 jets in 2022 to 48,600 by 2042. Last year's outlook predicted a global fleet of 43,470 aircraft in 2041.The company also raised its industrywide passenger traffic forecast growth rate slightly from 3.8% to 4%. And while the air cargo market is taking ""a little bit of a breather,"" the estimated 3% annual growth in trade over the next 20 years will provide a tailwind for future demand, Hulst said.Story continues""I think we'll again see how resilient the demand for air cargo is because it's consistently around 3.5% to 4% growth,"" he said.Although Chinese air traffic remained depressed in 2022, Hulst said Boeing remains ""very bullish"" on China, which will make up 20% of the market, with the rest of Asia making up another 22% of demand.Airbus, which published its own market forecast on Wednesday, also raised its delivery projections, estimating that 40,850 new jets would be handed over to customers through 2042.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna; editing by Jonathan Oatis)]"

Profits aren’t.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regional-banks-stocks-are-rallying-profits-arent-114203687.html,1687088523,STORY,"['ZION', 'KEY', '^KRX', 'JPM', 'PACW', 'PACWP', 'WAL', 'WAL-PA', 'CFG', 'CFG-PD', 'CFG-PE']","[The stocks of regional banks have rallied from their lows in the spring. Yet their earnings remain under pressure.Many lenders this week revised down their estimates of a key measure of profitability, net interest income, which shows the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay to attract deposits.Executives said they expect these margins to get smaller in the second quarter because they are paying more to bring in deposits as the fight for funding gets more competitive across the industry.The guidance from the chief operating officer of Zions (ZION) was that net interest income for the next 12 months would be ""decreasing,"" a downgrade from ""moderately decreasing.""John Woods, CFO for Citizens Financial Group (CFG), said its decline would be “a little more” than the 3% previously predicted.The finance chief of KeyCorp (KEY) said net interest income would be ""in the range of down 12"" percent, more than twice a prior prediction.""We're going to come in softer than we thought,"" said KeyCorp CFO Clark Khayat.The warnings, all delivered at a Morgan Stanley conference in New York, offered an early preview of what could be in store when lenders release their second-quarter results in mid July.'We all knew this was coming'Regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the failures of three lenders within a matter of days triggered panic across the country. And many are now attracting back some of the deposits they lost in the spring.But they still face some of the same macroeconomic problems that contributed to the turmoil, including high interest rates.An aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation has lowered the value of the assets banks hold, such as loans or bonds, just as deposit costs creep higher to keep customers from seeking higher yields elsewhere.""We all knew this was coming,"" Tim Coffey, an analyst with Janney told Yahoo Finance. ""The whole reason we’re seeing lower net interest for 2Q is because the Fed went parabolic with rate increases.""Story continuesThe Fed last Wednesday made it clear this past week that more hikes are coming this year. But it also decided to pause in June, which does buy banks some time.""With the pause it gives banks a chance to catch up to the new reality,"" Coffey said.'The crisis may not be over'For the moment investors are sending stocks mostly higher.Since hitting a year to date low on May 4, the week regulators seized First Republic and sold the bulk of its operations to JPMorgan Chase, the KBW Regional Bank Index (KRX) has rallied 15%, outpacing the S&amp;P 500 during that time. That run has included four straight weeks of gains. The index closed slightly down Friday.Some of the banks that experienced the most turmoil in the spring are among the best performers. The stock of PacWest (PACW) has climbed 159%, while Western Alliance (WAL) is up 113%. Zions has climbed 45%.Investors are hoping some of these stocks return to pre-crisis valuations, but it won't be easy, said Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist with Interactive Brokers.""It's going to take time for people to really go through each bank in a granular fashion to figure out whether there are more minefields out there,"" Sosnick told Yahoo Finance.Timothy Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls &amp; Snyder, told Yahoo Finance his firm added to its holdings of Western Alliance in late May and those positions are now up roughly 18%.His firm, he said, likes the fact that Western Alliance has reduced its reliance on uninsured depositors, who are more likely to flee during times of stress.The headquarters of Western Alliance in Phoenix. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)""These banks are likely to attract assets going forward given that they're survivors of the crisis, but the crisis may not be over,"" Ghriskey said. ""The group in general is attractive, but it's probably not going to be smooth sailing, it's not going to be straight up.""Many of these banks, in fact, are still below where they traded at the start of the year. PacWest is still down 64% year to date, Zions is down 41% and Western Alliance is 37% lower than its Jan. 1 level. Many fell during trading on Friday.""Even though they've rallied pretty strongly since early May, they’re still way below their February highs,"" Matt Maley, Miller Tabak Chief Market Strategist told Yahoo Finance.""There are a lot of reasons to be cautious but like anything else, the ones that survive are going to look really, really good five years from now,"" Maley added.Trouble ahead?Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with Wells Fargo, told Bloomberg he didn’t expect any more banks to fail in the immediate term.""The detour for not owning bank stocks is over,"" he said during an appearance on Bloomberg Surveillance. ""There’s over 4,500 banks. You’re going to have bank failures — that’s the rule of banking. It’s not going to be any bank in the S&amp;P 500, in my view, over the immediate time-frame. So that phase is over.""There still could be trouble ahead for many banks, even if they don’t fail. Regulators are preparing new capital requirements that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase their stability but will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits.The larger banks aren’t immune to challenges, either. Many with big Wall Street operations are suffering through a drought of deal making that will likely drag down their second-quarter results.Citigroup said on Wednesday it would be eliminating 1,600 people during the second quarter, the latest giant institution to announce Wall Street-related cuts.Even JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the nation’s biggest and most profitable bank, is feeling pressure from an industry wide fight for deposits that is making life more difficult for its smaller rivals.""Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,"" Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said Wednesday.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion this year, but if the deposit pressure keeps up that figure could experience a ""mild reprice,"" she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

This will take the annual payment to 3.2% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. View our latest analysis for Target Target's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. At the time of the last dividend payment, Target was paying out a very large proportion of what it was earning and 402% of cash flows. This is certainly a risk factor, as reduced cash flows could force the company to pay a lower dividend.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 104.3%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 39% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTarget Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.44 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $4.32. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, Target's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year. Earnings are not growing quickly at all, and the company is paying out most of its profit as dividends. When a company prefers to pay out cash to its shareholders instead of reinvesting it, this can often say a lot about that company's dividend prospects.In SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Target will make a great income stock. While Target is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. As an example, we've identified 4 warning signs for Target that you should be aware of before investing.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) share price is up 90% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 51% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 33% , including dividends .On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Analog Devices stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 109%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Analog Devices has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 33% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 16%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. If you would like to research Analog Devices in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.But note: Analog Devices may not be the best stock to buy.

(AP) — After appointees of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took over Walt Disney World’s governing district earlier this year, its firefighters were among the few employees who publicly welcomed them with open arms.But that warm relationship is in jeopardy as a new district administrator has reopened negotiations on a contract that was approved last month by the unionized firefighters, promising pay raises and more manpower.A vote on the contract originally was targeted for last month during a meeting of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District board of supervisors. But it was never brought up, and it did not appear on an agenda released ahead of the next meeting scheduled for Wednesday.Under the three-year contract proposal overwhelmingly approved by 200 firefighters and first responders, annual starting pay for firefighters would increase to $65,000, up from $55,000. It also promised hiring up to three dozen firefighters and paramedics.At several meetings since the DeSantis-appointed supervisors took their seats this spring, Jon Shirey, who leads the firefighters' union, praised them for visiting firefighters at their stations around the 39 square-mile (101 square-kilometer) Disney World property.The firefighters looked forward to collaborating with the new supervisors and administrator after years of clashing with their Disney-supporting predecessors, and viewed the appointments as “an opportunity for a fresh start,” he said.“Almost overnight, a change occurred that we have never experienced — transparency, open dialogue, the ability to sit down and have our issues heard and felt listened to,” Shirey told board members last month. “You have been able to build bridges that were long burned.”The feeling was mutual, with board chairman Martin Garcia saying last month that the supervisors were working with the firefighters to resolve their issues. Even so, Garcia made clear that the firefighters weren't the only district employees the board wanted to support.Story continues“We also need to let the (other) employees know, we love you, too. We care about you. We love you as much as we love our firefighters,” Garcia said.But the delay in approving the contract has alienated the firefighters' union, which last year endorsed the gubernatorial reelection campaign of DeSantis, who recently launched a campaign for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.The old contract expired four years ago, and the firefighters declared an impasse last year when the district’s board was still controlled by Disney supporters. The Reedy Creek Professional Firefighters, Local 2117 have warned for years that they are understaffed, which poses a safety risk as the central Florida theme park resort grows bigger.Last month, District Administrator John Classe, who originally negotiated the new contract, was replaced by the board with Glenton Gilzean, a DeSantis ally who previously served as president and CEO of the Central Florida Urban League and will receive a $400,000 salary in his new job. The district also is paying Classe to stay on as a special advisor.Board spokesperson Alexei Woltornist said negotiations with the union were continuing, without explaining why they were reopened with a contract already approved by the firefighters and first responders.“Administrator Gilzean is actively working with the fire department to finalize a deal that offers a competitive compensation package and gives firefighters the resources they need to protect the public,” Woltornist said in an email to The Associated Press.Officials with the firefighters' union did not comment.While Gilzean may alienate the firefighters, whose support gave the DeSantis takeover some legitimacy, he may gain credibility with other constituencies within Disney's governing district and put some distance between himself and his predecessor, said Richard Foglesong, a Rollins College professor emeritus who wrote a definitive account of Disney World’s governance in his book, “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando.”“He’s an unproven administrator, yet here he’s showing he’s no pushover when dealing with a cantankerous group, which frankly impresses me,” Foglesong said.The DeSantis appointees took over the Disney World governing board earlier this year following a yearlong feud between the company and DeSantis. The fight began last year after Disney, beset by significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by Florida lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But before the new board came in, the company made agreements with previous oversight board members that stripped the new supervisors of their authority over design and construction.Disney sued DeSantis and the five-member board, asking a federal judge to void the governor’s takeover of the theme park district, as well as the oversight board’s actions, on the grounds they were violations of company’s free speech rights.The board sued Disney in state court in an effort to maintain its control of construction and design at Disney World.The district was created in 1967 when then-Florida Gov. Claude Kirk signed legislation authorizing it to regulate land use, enforce building codes, treat wastewater, control drainage, maintain utilities and provide fire protection at Disney World.Such private governments aren’t uncommon in fast-growing Florida, which has more than 600 community development districts that manage and pay for infrastructure in new communities.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

For you see in F1, the more competitive the team is, the more prize money they get.McLaren Racing, one of the legendary teams up there in F1 lore like Ferrari and Williams, is celebrating its 60th year as an F1 constructor. CEO Zak Brown, a long-time vet of the racing scene both in F1 and other series, is slowly trying to bring the team back after a recent lull in its history.For Brown, F1’s popularity, and his own team’s success, depends on a strong US — one that many automakers involved in F1, and McLaren’s own road car business, depends on for a majority of sales.McLaren CEO Zak Brown speaks during a news conference in advance of the Formula One Miami Grand Prix auto race, Friday, May 5, 2023, at the Miami International Autodrome in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)""I think it's early days, which is amazing,"" Brown says of Formula 1’s US appeal, which started around the time Netflix’s “Drive to Survive” series started five years ago. ""A lot of people are saying, 'How long do you think it will continue?' And my answer is, 'I think we're actually just getting started, right?' We haven't even had Las Vegas yet.""The inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix is coming this year, under the lights, in mid-November. This follows F1’s return to the US with a semi-permanent race in Austin, and two races in Miami which began last year. Brown notes F1’s success has led to a new TV contract in the US with ESPN, with ratings still relatively strong.This of course has led to blue-chip US companies like Oracle, Chipotle, Workday, and AutoNation joining the sponsorship ranks.Brown, who cut his teeth bringing in sponsors for various race teams he worked for after his career as a racer, has seen McLaren boost its sponsorship numbers tremendously since he took the reins a few years back. And the big names appear here to stay.Story continuesMONTMELO, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren drives on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Montmelo, Spain. (Photo by Emmanuele Ciancaglini/Ciancaphoto Studio/Getty Images)""The Googles, the Goldman Sachses, the Coca-Colas — these are unbelievable companies that are now entering the sport and seeing how big and powerful our sport is,"" he said. Alphabet’s Google and Goldman joined McLaren last year as official sponsors, with Coke joining two years ago.From McLaren’s end, even a somewhat uneven global macro environment hasn’t dissuaded corporate sponsorship.""Not yet, and I keep saying not yet because I'm waiting for it to come,"" Brown joked. ""I think the sport is doing so well, that the ‘good stuff in life’ seems to be – I don't want to say a recession proof because I don't want to jinx it – but we're not seeing it. Our numbers are up. We're a profitable Formula 1 team for the first time in about 10 years.""MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: A crowd enjoys the atmosphere at the fan stage prior to practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)One of the big reasons why US sponsors are excited is, as mentioned above, the third race coming to the US — and that’s Vegas. And with the checkered flag dropping on a Saturday night (a first for F1 that usually races on Sunday), it’s going got be all eyes on the Strip.""I think it's going to be probably the largest global sporting event in the world this year, I can't think of something that's going to be bigger,"" Brown said. ""The excitement is going to be off the charts, and I can't wait to see everyone who shows up - it's going to be the celebrities, the athletes, the CEOs, and, of course, hundreds of thousands of fans.""Case in point — if you want to get tickets for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, you are out of luck — it’s sold out.

Never miss another market-moving alert.Oracle delivers Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) shares shot higher Monday after it said Q4 earnings came in at $1.67 per share, $0.09 better than what Wall Street was expecting, on above-par revenue of $13.8 billion.Analysts cheered the results: Goldman Sachs called the report ""solid,"" upgrading the stock to Neutral from Sell with a $120 price target. Goldman said it was ""encouraged by the pronounced step-up in IaaS revenue growth,"" which it said ""should position the company for durable share gains despite its late entry into IaaS.""Wolfe Research and Deutsche Bank each kept their buy ratings on the stock and lifted their price targets on Oracle - to $140 from $130, and to $135 from $120, respectively.All in all, the stock was up some 14% for the week vs. the prior Friday's close, ending at $125.46.AMD unveils AI detailsAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares got a brief bump after the chipmaker unveiled details about its new artificial intelligence chip, although they ultimately ended the week 6.6% lower, easing off a year-to-date surge.The chip, called the MI300X, will feature an accelerator that is designed to speed up processing times for generative AI programs like ChatGPT and other similar chatbots. Piper Sandler argued that the company has the ""building blocks"" to address the needs of both cloud and enterprise businesses.Still, Morgan Stanley named rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) its Top Pick in the AI space ""as the only company likely beating and raising due to AI in CY23,"" and raised its price target to $500 from $450.Story continuesThe analyst also raised the price target on AMD to $138 from $97, citing the broader boom in the industry that should help it through 2024 and beyond. But it said of AMD, ""Unlike NVIDIA, the company is unlikely to post near term upside.""It added, ""Longer-term we still have conviction that the company's server business remains on a share-gaining path, which will resume in a stronger way once budgets expand again to accommodate both AI investments and legacy infrastructure upgrades.""In this same note, the analyst also raised price targets on Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).Adobe's solid quarterAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) on Thursday topped the analyst consensus on Q2 with earnings of $3.91 per share - $0.12 better than expectations - on revenue of $4.82B vs. the $4.77B estimate.In response, Wells Fargo said Adobe ""delivered solid Q2 upside, an uncharacteristic raise to [full-year] targets, and some new details around expected AI monetization,"" raised its price target to $600 from $525, and maintained the company's Overweight rating.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Buy-rated Adobe to $550 from $500 per share, calling it a ""compelling opportunity"" and adding, ""Adobe reported solid F2Q results, but the star of the show, as expected, was generative AI.""Meanwhile, Citi's Adobe price target moved to $544 from $462. But it maintains its Neutral rating on the stock, saying, ""We worry about leading indicators deteriorating as price tailwinds increasingly fade in the coming [quarters] and magnitude of [generative AI] monetization unlikely to be significant near term, with questions around conversion.""Telsa concludes 13-day winning streak Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ended trading Wednesday down 0.74%, ending a 13-day rally that saw its shares gain 29.3%.

50,f25231a1-eba8-32bf-9082-0fc775e228b5,CL,2023-06-18,Colgate-Palmolive's (NYSE:CL) investors will be pleased with their favorable 36% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colgate-palmolives-nyse-cl-investors-110018384.html,1687086018,STORY,['CL'],"[When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) share price is up 20% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 5.1% in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Colgate-Palmolive's earnings per share are down 4.1% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.Since EPS is down a bit, and the share price is up, it's probably that the market previously had some concerns about the company, but the reality has been better than feared. Having said that, if the EPS falls continue we'd be surprised to see a sustained increase in share price.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Colgate-Palmolive, it has a TSR of 36% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveColgate-Palmolive shareholders gained a total return of 7.7% during the year. But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 6% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Colgate-Palmolive better, we need to consider many other factors.

Never miss another market-moving alert.Oracle delivers Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) shares shot higher Monday after it said Q4 earnings came in at $1.67 per share, $0.09 better than what Wall Street was expecting, on above-par revenue of $13.8 billion.Analysts cheered the results: Goldman Sachs called the report ""solid,"" upgrading the stock to Neutral from Sell with a $120 price target. Goldman said it was ""encouraged by the pronounced step-up in IaaS revenue growth,"" which it said ""should position the company for durable share gains despite its late entry into IaaS.""Wolfe Research and Deutsche Bank each kept their buy ratings on the stock and lifted their price targets on Oracle - to $140 from $130, and to $135 from $120, respectively.All in all, the stock was up some 14% for the week vs. the prior Friday's close, ending at $125.46.AMD unveils AI detailsAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares got a brief bump after the chipmaker unveiled details about its new artificial intelligence chip, although they ultimately ended the week 6.6% lower, easing off a year-to-date surge.The chip, called the MI300X, will feature an accelerator that is designed to speed up processing times for generative AI programs like ChatGPT and other similar chatbots. Piper Sandler argued that the company has the ""building blocks"" to address the needs of both cloud and enterprise businesses.Still, Morgan Stanley named rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) its Top Pick in the AI space ""as the only company likely beating and raising due to AI in CY23,"" and raised its price target to $500 from $450.Story continuesThe analyst also raised the price target on AMD to $138 from $97, citing the broader boom in the industry that should help it through 2024 and beyond. But it said of AMD, ""Unlike NVIDIA, the company is unlikely to post near term upside.""It added, ""Longer-term we still have conviction that the company's server business remains on a share-gaining path, which will resume in a stronger way once budgets expand again to accommodate both AI investments and legacy infrastructure upgrades.""In this same note, the analyst also raised price targets on Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).Adobe's solid quarterAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) on Thursday topped the analyst consensus on Q2 with earnings of $3.91 per share - $0.12 better than expectations - on revenue of $4.82B vs. the $4.77B estimate.In response, Wells Fargo said Adobe ""delivered solid Q2 upside, an uncharacteristic raise to [full-year] targets, and some new details around expected AI monetization,"" raised its price target to $600 from $525, and maintained the company's Overweight rating.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Buy-rated Adobe to $550 from $500 per share, calling it a ""compelling opportunity"" and adding, ""Adobe reported solid F2Q results, but the star of the show, as expected, was generative AI.""Meanwhile, Citi's Adobe price target moved to $544 from $462. But it maintains its Neutral rating on the stock, saying, ""We worry about leading indicators deteriorating as price tailwinds increasingly fade in the coming [quarters] and magnitude of [generative AI] monetization unlikely to be significant near term, with questions around conversion.""Telsa concludes 13-day winning streak Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ended trading Wednesday down 0.74%, ending a 13-day rally that saw its shares gain 29.3%. The company’s previous streak of 11 days was attained in January 2021.The rally follows recent commitments made by General Motors (NYSE: NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), which announced the adoption of the Tesla-designed North American Charging Standard (NACS) charging connector for electric vehicles.Following those announcements, charging equipment makers such as Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK), ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT), and Tritium (NASDAQ:DCFC) also got on board, saying they too would offer chargers with the Tesla connector.Shares were up some 5% for the week.Nasdaq agrees to buy Adenza for $10.5BNasdaq Inc.

For you see in F1, the more competitive the team is, the more prize money they get.McLaren Racing, one of the legendary teams up there in F1 lore like Ferrari and Williams, is celebrating its 60th year as an F1 constructor. CEO Zak Brown, a long-time vet of the racing scene both in F1 and other series, is slowly trying to bring the team back after a recent lull in its history.For Brown, F1’s popularity, and his own team’s success, depends on a strong US — one that many automakers involved in F1, and McLaren’s own road car business, depends on for a majority of sales.McLaren CEO Zak Brown speaks during a news conference in advance of the Formula One Miami Grand Prix auto race, Friday, May 5, 2023, at the Miami International Autodrome in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""I think it's early days, which is amazing,"" Brown says of Formula 1’s US appeal, which started around the time Netflix’s “Drive to Survive” series started five years ago. ""A lot of people are saying, 'How long do you think it will continue?' And my answer is, 'I think we're actually just getting started, right?' We haven't even had Las Vegas yet.""The inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix is coming this year, under the lights, in mid-November. This follows F1’s return to the US with a semi-permanent race in Austin, and two races in Miami which began last year. Brown notes F1’s success has led to a new TV contract in the US with ESPN, with ratings still relatively strong.This of course has led to blue-chip US companies like Oracle, Chipotle, Workday, and AutoNation joining the sponsorship ranks.Brown, who cut his teeth bringing in sponsors for various race teams he worked for after his career as a racer, has seen McLaren boost its sponsorship numbers tremendously since he took the reins a few years back. And the big names appear here to stay.Story continuesMONTMELO, SPAIN - JUNE 04: Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren drives on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Spain at Circuit de Catalunya on June 04, 2023 in Montmelo, Spain.

Alphabet’s Google and Goldman joined McLaren last year as official sponsors, with Coke joining two years ago.From McLaren’s end, even a somewhat uneven global macro environment hasn’t dissuaded corporate sponsorship.""Not yet, and I keep saying not yet because I'm waiting for it to come,"" Brown joked. ""I think the sport is doing so well, that the ‘good stuff in life’ seems to be – I don't want to say a recession proof because I don't want to jinx it – but we're not seeing it. Our numbers are up. We're a profitable Formula 1 team for the first time in about 10 years.""MONTREAL, QUEBEC - JUNE 16: A crowd enjoys the atmosphere at the fan stage prior to practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on June 16, 2023 in Montreal, Quebec. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images) (Bryn Lennon - Formula 1 via Getty Images)One of the big reasons why US sponsors are excited is, as mentioned above, the third race coming to the US — and that’s Vegas. And with the checkered flag dropping on a Saturday night (a first for F1 that usually races on Sunday), it’s going got be all eyes on the Strip.""I think it's going to be probably the largest global sporting event in the world this year, I can't think of something that's going to be bigger,"" Brown said. ""The excitement is going to be off the charts, and I can't wait to see everyone who shows up - it's going to be the celebrities, the athletes, the CEOs, and, of course, hundreds of thousands of fans.""Case in point — if you want to get tickets for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, you are out of luck — it’s sold out.

Horton (NYSE:DHI) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 19% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study D.R. Horton's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for D.R. Horton is:25% = US$5.2b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.25 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.D.R. Horton's Earnings Growth And 25% ROETo begin with, D.R. Horton has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 20% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 34% net income growth seen by D.R. Horton over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between D.R. Horton's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 33% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is DHI worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether DHI is currently mispriced by the market.Is D.R. Horton Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?D.R. Horton's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 6.9% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (93%) of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Besides, D.R. Horton has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 11% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 13%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with D.R. Horton's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.
