The steel giant expects earnings per share to be within the range of $5.45-$5.55 per share. This forecast shows an improvement from the first quarter of 2023 when net earnings totaled $4.45 per share, while it suggests a decline from the year-ago net earnings of $9.67 per share.Nucor foresees enhanced earnings performance in its steel mills segment in the second quarter of 2023 compared with the previous quarter. This improvement is mainly attributed to margin expansion at its sheet mills. Similarly, the steel products segment is expected to maintain strong performance, comparable to the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, the raw materials segment is projected to experience a sequential rise in profitability in the second quarter of 2023, driven by the improved performance of the company’s DRI facilities.As part of its financial activities, Nucor has undertaken share repurchases during the second quarter. Around 3.1 million shares have been repurchased at an average price of $147.03 per share. Year to date, the company has repurchased around 5.8 million shares at an average price of $151.41 per share. In total, Nucor has returned more than $1.13 billion to its stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividend payments so far this year.Nucor has gained 32.6% in the past year, compared with the industry's 29.9% rise in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the first quarter of 2023, the company reported growth in steel mills shipments, with a 4% increase year over year. Shipments to external customers also rose 1%. However, average sales prices declined in the quarter, falling 18% year over year and 11% sequentially. The steel mills unit saw increased earnings due to higher volumes and improved margins, while the steel products division reported lower earnings due to reduced realized prices. The raw materials segment showed improved earnings, driven by higher volumes in DRI facilities and scrap recycling. Nucor's cash and cash equivalents rose 2% but long-term debt increased around 8%.

You can skip our detailed analysis of GARP investment and the performance of these stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends. If there is one thing the market has taught investors this past year, it is the importance of diversifying portfolios to reduce risk. Choosing stocks in different economic conditions has consistently posed challenges for investors because what works in one market may not work in another. For example, growth and value equities have exhibited varied performances over different time periods and market conditions, making them equally popular among investors. So, combining the elements of both strategies can offer investors a much-needed way out from traditional investment plans. This is where the GARP strategy comes in. Growth at a Reasonable Price, or GARP, is a relatively lesser-known investment approach that seeks to identify companies with sustainable earnings growth and attractive valuations relative to their growth prospects. These companies may operate in industries or sectors with favorable growth trends or possess competitive advantages that can drive their future growth.Popularized by Peter Lynch, the GARP strategy’s main goal is to avoid the extremes of either growth or value investing, which leads investors to growth-oriented stocks with relatively low price-to-earnings ratios in normal market conditions. If successfully identified, these stocks have the potential to generate positive returns for shareholders. Historically, the S&amp;P 500 GARP Index has delivered higher returns than its underlying benchmark. The index tracks the performance of companies with consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuation, and strong earnings power. Some of the best GARP stocks in the index are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).  In the past 12 months, the index gained 12.7%.Story continuesAccording to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 GARP delivered an annual average return of 13.2% from June 1995 to June 2019, compared with a 9.81% growth of the S&amp;P 500. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index and the S&amp;P 500 Enhanced Value Index returned 10.41% and 11.83%, respectively. The report also mentioned that the GARP Index’s risk-adjusted returns during the above-mentioned period were higher than growth and value indices.Also read: 12 Best Fast Growth Stocks to Buy NowCPI’s latest report shows that consumer prices rose 4% this May, down from 4.9% in April. This cooling inflation also signals a pause in interest rate hikes, giving investors room to take a breather from the longest streak of increases. However, this does not imply that the stock market is out of the perils as investors still need meticulous investment plans. BMO Capital’s chief strategist Brian Belski advised Canadian investors to follow the GARP strategy this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) remains one of our key style preferences for Canadian equities in 2023. Furthermore, earnings growth and revision trends are broadly consistent with the S&amp;P 500, suggesting there are likely many opportunities developing in Canada to implement a growth at a reasonable price strategy.”CNBC report also highlighted remarks of BMO’s analysts about the possible investment strategies to navigate the market uncertainties in the US. The report mentioned that investors should use GARP and dividend growth approaches in the current financial environment. Dividend stocks have proved their mettle in previous inflationary periods, becoming popular among investors.

For this list, we used the S&amp;P 500 GARP Index (SPXGARPP) and identified dividend stocks with P/E ratios below 32 and EPS growth estimates for FY23 above 6%.

(NYSE:UPS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We purchased United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) during the quarter. UPS is a global parcel shipment and logistics company which competes in a global oligopoly with high barriers to entry. UPS’ integrated network is more efficient than its closest peer, as evidenced by its margin profile, free cash flow conversion, and returns on invested capital. The company’s management team is focusing on profitable growth through its Better, not Bigger strategy which should improve margins and future opportunities for the company. The stock price was down due to market concerns about customer concentration and Amazon’s potential entry into the parcel delivery and logistics market. Additionally, UPS Teamsters’ labor agreement expires on July 31, 2023.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Nucor Nucor Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Leon Topalian, for US$2.2m worth of shares, at about US$112 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$151). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 13% of Leon Topalian's holding.In the last year Nucor insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Nucor insiders own 0.6% of the company, currently worth about US$230m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Nucor Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Nucor insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most profitable tech companies in the world.The tech industry may be one of the biggest industries in the world, but 2022 was a disastrous year, with the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index, an index which tracks tech companies in the country, down over 35% as opposed to a 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500. While tech companies saw share prices jump astronomically during the Covid-19 pandemic and also post recovery, resulting in many major tech companies going on hiring sprees. However, 2022 was a year full of uncertainty, resulting in the worst first half in more than half a century for stocks in the U.S., as economic uncertainty and inflation resulted in increasing pressure on earnings and stock performance, while higher interest rates to battle rising inflation only increased the strain on stock returns. War between Russia and Ukraine simply added to a tumultuous year, all of which combined to see 2022 become the first year in which the NASDAQ, on which several of the most profitable tech companies in the world are listed, drop in value in four quarters.Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) alone lost around tw0-thirds of its entire value, a lot of it predicated on the belief that the metaverse is failing, which is not good news for some of the biggest metaverse companies in the world. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), another major tech company, though surprisingly not among the most profitable tech companies, had losses in the trailing twelve months. IPOs have also declined as companies which have had IPOs recently haven't performed too well in the stock market, as opposed to the most profitable tech companies in the world.Top 20 Most Profitable Tech Companies in the WorldPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashAll of this has led to tens of thousands of job cuts across major and minor tech companies, with almost all major companies significantly reducing headcount, reversing hiring sprees carried out at the height of the pandemic. However, that doesn't mean that it's all doom and gloom for tech investors. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has branched into AI, purportedly the next big thing in tech, has seen its stock price jump over 170% in just 2023, and breached the trillion dollar mark in the same year. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) saw its stock price increase by a more modest but still significantly healthy 37% while Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock price jumped by nearly 45%.Story continuesOne of the reasons behind this recent increase in tech stock prices is the AI craze, which may have been going on for a few years, but has reached the next level towards the end of 2022, driven by the release and success of ChatGPT and the hope of less aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed. NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) brilliant earnings report cemented its position as the global AI leader while other tech companies are also making significant investments in the artificial intelligence sector. According to Victoria Greene, the Chief Investment Officer in G Squared Private Wealth ""“Being concentrated in these mega-cap tech stocks has been where to be in this market. You cannot deny the potential in AI, you cannot deny the earnings prowess that these companies have.” Meanwhile, the CFO of  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stated in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call ""Record revenue of 4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 14% year on year on strong growth of our accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets. Let me give you some color across our three major customer categories: Cloud service providers or CSPs, consumer internet companies, and enterprises.""While there is some concern that artificial intelligence is growing too quickly and poses a threat to humanity, as outlined in a letter written by industry leaders, including Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who are considered the ""godfathers"" of artificial intelligence. All of this goes to show that investors who have suffered in 2022 are now seeing returns on their investment in 2023, and this increase in profits is likely to continue in at least the immediate future.

We then checked the latest trailing-twelve-month (TTM) profit from continuing operations for each company from Yahoo Finance, to exclude any one-offs which don't truly reflect a company's operations or profits. For companies which had profits in foreign currencies, we converted them to USD based on the latest exchange rates. For Huawei, which is not listed, we obtained its net profit from its annual report. We then sorted the list from highest profits to lowest. Together, these companies have earned nearly $450 billion in net profits alone.20. HP Inc.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230616671712/en/David Cash is Service Sales Representative for Cintas based out of the company's Lawrenceville, Ga., Rental location. He is the second of three generations of Cash family members to work for the company - including his father and his son. David recently celebrated his 50th anniversary with the company. (Photo: Business Wire)Three generations of Cashes – Deward, David and Ryan – have dedicated their careers in the business services industry in what has become a family affair at Cintas Corporation (Nasdaq: CTAS).&gt;&gt; WATCH MORE ON YOUTUBE: https://cint.as/3CAhbASDeward Cash, who passed in 2000, was the first in the industry.His son David celebrated 50 years of service in September with a company that started as National Linen Service, became G&amp;K Services and is now Cintas. David’s son Ryan, Deward’s grandson, has logged a combined 12-plus years at G&amp;K and Cintas.David and Ryan Cash work out of Location 258 in Lawrenceville, Ga.""Everybody is really proud of us,"" Ryan Cash said. ""I can’t really remember how many years my grandfather was in – 25 or 30, something like that – and then of course Dad going to 50 this year was crazy. We’re really proud and happy that he’s able to still work and be able to be healthy. So it’s pretty cool for our family.""By the time David Cash finished his service in the U.S. Air Force, Deward was well into his career. He encouraged David to give the profession some thought based on its benefits: independence, stability, customer interaction and financial potential.Story continues""Dad, he was a big influence on me as far as getting into the industry,"" David Cash said.His guidance led to a career for his son. In 1972, David Cash began his career at National Linen, which was acquired by G&amp;K in 1997. He spent 44.5 of his 50 years in the industry before Cintas acquired G&amp;K in 2017.In total, Deward and David spent seven years at co-workers at National Linen and G&amp;K.Long before he retired at age 62, Deward Cash’s work ethic had a lasting impact on his family. David Cash said his father – the father of four boys – drilled home accountability and follow-through. That mindset stayed with David Cash as an adult, giving him an even greater appreciation for his dad and providing a blueprint for parenting his son.""I hope that I’ve planted some good seeds in Ryan to help him in his journey with Cintas in future years and that he’ll stick with it,"" David said. ""And hopefully it will benefit him and his family both.""Ryan was a University of Georgia student when he began working at G&amp;K during summer and winter breaks. He liked the job so much that he ""just kind of grew into it,"" first at the plant and then helping on routes.After college, Ryan officially followed his father into the business full-time and became a third-generation route driver. Although their routes differed at G&amp;K, Ryan always enjoyed bumping into his dad in the mornings or evenings at the workplace.""We’d just say, ‘Hey, how are you? Doing OK? How was it out on the route today?’ And stuff like that. It was good, it was a lot of fun. Just learning a little bit every day from him,"" said Ryan Cash, who spent 6.5 years at G&amp;K and has been with Cintas for almost six years.Times have changed since David Cash started his career. SSRs used to drive territory-based routes, which meant David ran two weekly trips into downtown Atlanta. Reps also drove their trucks home, kept hard copies of customers’ orders and carried far more cash and checks than David preferred.As technology has started streamlining work processes to make the SSRs’ jobs more dynamic, David Cash has found himself learning a thing or two from his son.""Sometimes I’m really not tech savvy and he can help me on some things,"" David Cash said. ""I’m kind of old school, but if you show me one time, I got it.""David and Ryan Cash share a zest for customer service and building relationships with people they see regularly.The Cashes place great pride in being honest, dependable and accountable – three attributes that have strengthened their reputations at work among their fellow employee-partners and also their customers.David noted that he aims to be a reliable partner for his customers, taking care of them with great service and identifying solutions to issues – like needing replacement garments or making sure repairs are made – before they may even notice.""That way they don’t even see it. I just make sure the old garment is replaced in their delivery and they have a new garment. They don’t even know it sometimes. And then they’ll come back and say, ‘Hey, I appreciate you doing that.’ I love my good rapport with my customers,"" David Cash said.And a good rapport is a time-tested Cash family trait.About Cintas CorporationCintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing products and services that help keep their customers’ facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best.

10,cae59240-e43c-3b80-8cbc-a47090b751f6,EW,2023-06-17,When Should You Buy Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-edwards-lifesciences-corporation-nyse-120024863.html,1687003224,STORY,['EW'],"[Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Edwards Lifesciences’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences What's The Opportunity In Edwards Lifesciences?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Edwards Lifesciences’s ratio of 37.44x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 37.03x, which means if you buy Edwards Lifesciences today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe Edwards Lifesciences should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Edwards Lifesciences’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Edwards Lifesciences?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Edwards Lifesciences' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 35%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in EW’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at EW? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on EW, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for EW, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Edwards Lifesciences from their most recent forecasts.

However, persistent forex woes do not bode well. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Edwards Lifesciences exited the first quarter of 2023 on a bullish note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company also registered year-over-year growth on both fronts. The company’s Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT) segment registered strong growth, driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe. During the quarter, the company completed the enrolment of the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE Tricuspid Valve Replacement System.Further, growth within Surgical Structural Heart was lifted by the increased adoption of Edwards' premium products across all regions. The company raised its full-year 2023 guidance, which is encouraging too.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteEdwards Lifesciences expects to maintain its leadership position in the global Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) market through an increased focus on expanding patient access by actively leveraging current valve platforms for additional indications. This includes developing next-generation valve platforms and maintaining trusted relationships with clinicians, payers and regulators.Patients and clinicians are increasingly preferring TAVR. Based on the substantial body of compelling clinical evidence along with the strong adoption of its TAVR devices, management remains optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity its transcatheter therapies offer in the global market. Edwards Lifesciences also remain committed to aggressively investing in structural heart disease and critical care technologies.Edwards Lifesciences continues to expect the global TAVR opportunity to increase to $10 billion by 2028, implying a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. Also, management projects TMTT opportunity to be $5 billion by 2028.Story continuesOn the flip side, the contraction of both margins during the first quarter was discouraging. In the quarter, gross margin contracted 25 basis points (bps) to 77.4%. The company-provided adjusted gross margin was 77.5%, reflecting a 30 basis-point contraction year over year. This year-over-year reduction was due to a less favorable impact from foreign exchange.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 17.8% year over year. During the reported quarter, operating income fell 2.3% year over year. The operating margin contracted 339 bps to 29.6%.The choppy market conditions due to the persistent foreign exchange impact and stiff competition within the medical device industry are concerns.Meanwhile, the niche industry is highly competitive, with several competent players. In Heart Valve Therapy, Edwards Lifesciences primarily competes with Medtronic, whereas players such as ICU Medical, and Becton, Dickinson offer competition in the other segments.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Penumbra PEN, Lantheus LNTH and Haemonetics HAE.

Walmart announced the $257 million investment in Olathe, Kansas, to open a beef-packing plant. This new facility is expected to open in 2025, which is a ways away, but the good news is it will create more than 600 jobs for the Olathe area. The new facility will primarily focus on higher grades of beef, primarily the Angus beef from Sustainable Beef that Walmart has a minority stake in.Also doing its own acquiring, Unilever is acquiring Yasso Holdings, a manufacturer of frozen Greek yogurt snacks. Yasso has threaded the needle of consumer desire by offering a comfort food that’s healthier than the ice cream alternatives. This isn’t Unilever’s first foray into the dairy side of the freezer aisle as Yasso will join its current portfolio that includes Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Magnum and Talenti. If anything, this cements Unilever’s claim to take over the ice cream section.Temperature checks(Photo: CPKC news release)Canadian Pacific Kansas City has added 1,000 new 53-foot refrigerated intermodal containers. This addition more than doubles the existing fleet size. There is no doubt that the increase in refrigerated intermodal containers comes right after the announcement of the Mexico Midwest Express lane. This lane focuses on shippers with goods going from Mexico to the Midwest, with the inclusion now of temperature-controlled shippers. This new rail line is a single-line haul, including cross-border service that makes CPKC rail on par with trucks that commonly haul this freight but reduces emissions with the rail option.Also on the expansion front, Lebanon, Indiana, is the home of an expansion in temperature-controlled warehouse space. NewCold, an automated temperature-controlled warehouse company, is expanding its facility in Lebanon for a cool $300 million price tag. This expansion will add about 100 jobs in the Lebanon area as well as make it the largest automated cold storage facility in the U.S. Better alert Guinness World Records.Story continuesFood and drugs(Image: Transmedic news release)Organ transportation has come a long wayfrom the ice and a cooler that has been the traditional method of transporting organs since the 1950s. This method of transport, while effective, came with many limitations, the primary one being the distance the organ could travel. Organs could only be kept in the cooler for a maximum of four hours. Also, there was a tricky problem of freezer burn on organs transported within the cooler as temperature wasn’t regulated throughout the transportation.All of that is about to change as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new way to transport donated organs.

Seattle’s reefer outbound tender volumes have dropped 33.75% week over week (w/w). On the flip side, reefer outbound tender rejections have risen 238 basis points w/w. This sharp rise in rejections and decrease in volumes signals a tightening in capacity for the reefer market in Seattle.

This Minneapolis, MN-based company with a strong history of dividend payments provide a hedge against any odd swings in the stock market.This general merchandise retailer once again rewarded investors with a hike in the dividend payout. Target’s board of directors raised the quarterly dividend by 1.9% to $1.10 per share. The new dividend will be paid out on Sep 10, 2023, to its shareholders of record at the close of the business on Aug 16, 2023. Last June, Target hiked its regular quarterly dividend by 20% to $1.08.Backed by sound fundamentals and financial strength, Target has time and again highlighted its commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We note that net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,265 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The current hike marks the 52nd successive year of a dividend increase.We believe that such strategic steps not only drive shareholder value but also raise the market value of the stock. Through these dividend increases, companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip. People looking for regular income from stocks are most likely to choose companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payouts.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMore About the StockTarget has been undertaking several strategic endeavors — new stores, owned brand innovations, national brand partnerships, the expansion of same-day services or the rollout of sortation centers — to drive engagement, traffic and market share gains. These have been contributing to the company’s sales performance. Target witnessed stellar demand in frequency categories, such as Food &amp; Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Management intends to spend approximately $4-$5 billion in fiscal 2023 to continue scaling operations, reaching new customers as it builds capacity and enhances services and supply-chain facilities. To simplify and improve efficiencies across the business, Target has announced an enterprise-wide cost-containment effort. Through the initiative, the company plans to save between $2 billion and $3 billion over the next three years.Target has been directing resources toward expanding digital and omnichannel capabilities. The company has been ramping up its digital solutions and strengthening delivery capabilities to make shopping more seamless. Its services like doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store have been playing a crucial role in serving consumers better.We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have fallen 7.5% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 0.2%. The stock came under pressure following Target’s soft second-quarter comparable sales guidance. Target envisions second-quarter comparable sales to decline in the low single digits. It foresees greater SG&amp;A rate pressure in the second quarter. As a result, the operating margin rate is likely to decline on a sequential basis.Story continues3 Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Kroger KR, The TJX Companies TJX and Walmart WMT.Kroger, a supermarket operator, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Under Armour’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Under Armour Is Under Armour Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 37%, trading at US$7.81 compared to my intrinsic value of $5.72. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Under Armour’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Under Armour?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.

It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe UAA is currently trading above its value, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable.

A dividend hike can be an indirect way of letting shareholders know its taxable income may soon increase.Don't miss:Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

Other major central banks are tightening as well, with the Bank of England eyeing a quarter-point increase of its own, after the European Central Bank ramped up rates to 22-year highs on Thursday.""We're going to be going from Fed speaker to Fed speaker, and data point to data point,"" Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group and a prominent oil bull, said in comments carried by Reuters on Friday.New York-traded WTI crude settled up $1.16, or 1.6%, at $71.78 per barrel. Week-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark was up 2.3% after a 3.5% tumble over two prior weeks.London-traded Brent settled up 94 cents, or 1.2%, at $76.61. For the week, the global crude benchmark was up 2.4%, after a 3% slump over two prior weeks.It has been a swing of a time — literally — for oil which began the week with a 4% drop on Monday, driven by recession concerns. It then witnessed a 3% rebound Tuesday, aided by a Chinese rate cut.By Wednesday, oil slid 2% on a massive jump in U.S. crude inventories and a hawkish stance adopted by the Fed despite its hold on June rates. The next day, crude prices were up more than 3% on bullish Chinese refinery data, before drifting again in Friday’s trade.Some expect oil prices to see support later in the year from production cuts announced by Saudi Arabia. Analysts at UBS said on Thursday they expect a supply deficit of around 1.5 million barrels daily in June and more than 2M in July.“These are small positives but it could be enough to stop crude from making fresh lows for the year,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Story continuesBrent’s low thus far for 2023 has been $70.12, against WTI’s $63.70.The optimism of oil longs does not appear to fully factor in Russia’s unsupervised sales of oil, mostly done at or near the $60-a-barrel cap set by the G7 in accordance with sanctions imposed against Moscow over the Ukraine invasion.Russia’s state energy giant Rosneft is close to striking long-term deals to sell substantial supplies of oil, a sign that Moscow can continue to count on petroleum exports to fund its war on Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.Notwithstanding that, Russia’s Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Friday it was ""realistic"" to expect crude prices to return to around $80 per barrel, citing falling Russian oil and gas condensate production to around 20M tonnes (400,000 barrels per day) this year as one reason. Moscow’s forecasts on oil have largely been greeted with more than an ounce of skepticism by the market.Related ArticlesOil posts first weekly gain in three; Chinese data helps vs. hawkish Fed Natural Gas: Biggest week in 3 months as bulls celebrate smaller storage buildAnalysis-Iraq's enjoys respite from turmoil but risks remain]"

To skip the detailed analysis and latest updates on the oil industry, go directly to the top 5 countries with the highest oil consumption.While the world is aiming to move towards renewable energy as fast as possible, oil consumption is still continuing to increase year on year, and oil prices are strong indicators of the world's economy and where it's headed. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, oil consumption increased by 6.2% from 2020 to 2021, which may be lower than pre-pandemic figures but is still a substantial increase, which bodes well for the highest oil consuming countries.Even though most countries are enacting laws and regulations, in addition to offering incentives, to move towards renewable energy which is more sustainable in the long term and not as environmentally catastrophic, oil is still a key indicator of the global economy and an important contributor to its output, with the highest oil consuming countries playing a major part. In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, one of the biggest impacts of this war was on oil, and according to NPR ""Russia's war in Ukraine is causing a profound and permanent shift in the world's oil markets, creating new geopolitical alliances. Analysts say it's comparable to the 1970s Arab oil embargo.""Top 20 countries with the highest oil consumptionPhoto by Robin Sommer on UnsplashThe economy of many oil-rich countries depends entirely on their oil production, as evidenced in the 20 countries that have the largest oil reserves, which has allowed nations with otherwise little importance on the global stage to dictate terms and gain influence based on their oil output. And while demand for oil has continued to rise over decades especially as nations with huge populations such as China or India have continued to grow, the long-term challenge for the oil industry comes from developed nations which are aiming to move away from oil, even as global demand doubled in just the last five decades, from 2.3 million tonnes in the early 1970s, to 4.6 million tonnes just before the pandemic, with the countries with the highest oil consumption accounting for a large majority of total consumption. While population definitely has an impact on total consumption by country of oil, industrial nations also tend to consume more oil as compared to those with a sizable agricultural sector.Story continuesAccording to the U.S. Energy Administration, global crude oil reserves are only sufficient to meet demand till 2050, less than three decades from now, unless of course new massive reserves are discovered. This is why countries such as the UAE, which is one of the top oil producing countries in the world, has started to pivot away from just oil and focus more on being a major international tourist destination, attractive to companies as well for its lax tax rules, even though it is not among the countries with the highest oil consumption. Another major concern is economic uncertainty especially in the U.S. amidst a major banking crisis which has led to some of the biggest bankruptcies in U.S. history. This in turn has led to lower capital which is why growth has been curbed in some areas such as the U.S. shale patch, while major oil producers are reluctant to invest more in capex, with some exceptions as we'll discuss below.Despite these uncertainties, oil companies enjoyed a bumper 2022 mainly due to prices reaching record highs after Russia invaded Ukraine. The energy crisis resulted in oil and gas companies achieving historic highs in terms of profits including Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), which reflected in gains in share price as well, benefitting investors. However, in Europe, a windfall tax was imposed on companies which made historic profits as Europe grappled with a major energy crisis, which finally seems to be under control after a difficult 2022. This resulted in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) suing the European Union to block the windfall tax, stating that this would discourage companies from operating in Europe. This was recognized by Deloitte in its 2023 oil and gas industry outlook report where it stated ""The oil and gas (O&amp;G) industry earned record profits in 2022, providing ample cash flow to fund their strategies in 2023. And while O&amp;G companies recognize geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty in the year ahead, they’ve also been given a clear mandate to secure supply in the short term while transitioning to cleaner energy in the long term. Our 2023 outlook explores five trends that can help shape the path forward for O&amp;G companies.""This is also why some of these oil companies are taking major steps to increase oil production and supply, with Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stating in its Q1 2023 earnings call ""Following a record year, ExxonMobil delivered the highest first quarter earnings in our history, even as energy prices and refining margins moderated from the fourth quarter. This ongoing success reflects the hard work of our people, executing our strategic priorities and fully leveraging our competitive advantages. Through investments in advantaged assets, mix improvements, and cost and operating discipline, we are delivering the structural earnings improvements outlined in our corporate plan update last December and expanding the energy supplies needed to meet growing global demand. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, we added about 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to global supply, primarily from a 40% increase in production from Guyana and the Permian Basin. The increase more than offset our divestments in the expropriation of Sakhalin-1, which we no longer account for, but which, importantly, remains part of global supply. In addition, our Beaumont refinery expansion reached nameplate capacity in the quarter. This 250,000 barrels-a-day expansion is the largest U.S. refinery addition in a decade, helping meet society's ongoing need for transportation fuels. Guyana, we're pleased to announce that we reached final investment decisions for Uaru, fifth offshore project, which will bring on even more production from this low-cost, low-carbon intensity resource. Uaru will provide an additional 250,000 barrels a day of gross capacity, with start-up targeted for 2026.""MethodologyThe U.S. Energy Information Administration keeps detailed statistics on oil consumption by country, and we obtained data for both 2020 and 2021. The top 20 countries with the highest oil consumption alone accounted for more than three-quarters of the total global oil consumption, and just the top 5 nations accounted for over 50% of total global oil consumption. Unsurprisingly, these are also some of the countries with the biggest populations in the world, while many are well known for their industrial sectors, which are major oil consumers as well. We assigned 70% weightage to 2021 statistics as this provides the latest information and 30% to 2020. So, let's now take a look at the countries whose economies would plummet with the availability of oil, starting with:20. AustraliaTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 999Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,020We kick off our list with Australia, which is one of the least energy efficient countries in the developed world, with energy consumption per person actually increasing by 0.2% per year.19. ItalyTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 1,032Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,185According to Clean Energy Wire, the European Union, including Italy, is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, including oil, despite sanctions on Russia.18. SpainTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 1,088Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,188Spain registered an increase of 9% in oil consumption between 2020 to 2021, earning it a spot on the biggest oil consumers in the world.17. ThailandTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 1,185Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,192In 2022, Thailand's fuel usage increased by 13.5% mainly as a result of full resumption of travel, both by air and by land.16. United KingdomTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 1,211Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,258Data by the Office of National Statistics showed that 42% of adults in the UK reduced their non-essential travel as a result of rising energy costs. While crude oil prices fell later on in August 2022, weakening demand in the UK is still expected to continue.15. SingaporeTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 1,277Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,417Despite a population of just 5 million people, Singapore is among the highest oil consuming countries in the world, and a 2021 article by Power Engineering International reported that the country was the most dependent on fossil fuels in the world.14. MexicoTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 1,537Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,544Pemex, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, decided to reduce oil exports in 2022 before entirely phasing them out in 2023 in order to reach self-sufficiency.13. FranceTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 1,428Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,548France has been at the center of massive protests over the last several months over an increase in retirement age from 62 to 64. The protests have resulted in strikes at French ports and oil refineries, the impact of which has been felt across countries and continents, from Africa to America.12. IndonesiaTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 1,577Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,658Indonesia is the largest importer of motor oil in Asia, and Rystad Energy stated that the nation's 2023 gasoline demands and imports are both likely to handily beat 2022 numbers.11. IranTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 1,926Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 1,989Recently, Iran's oil ministry, the National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company, urged people to reduce their consumption of oil as the country's oil reserves are depleting.10. GermanyTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 2,148Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 2,126Germany is one of the only countries among those with the highest oil consumption which actually saw oil consumption decline, as the country aims to move away from non-renewable energy resources to renewable energy.9. CanadaTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 2,171Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 2,259While Canada is already implementing a plan to look beyond oil and gas, especially with Canada's oil production declining, the country needs to brace for a global decline in oil demand, and plan accordingly.8. South KoreaTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 2,448Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 2,578Surprisingly, South Korea is one of the biggest oil consumers in the world, with a heavy reliance on imports from Saudi Arabia.7. BrazilTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 2,790Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 2,887Brazil is one of the few countries which is actually increasing output by 300,000 barrels a day, which according to Bloomsberg is the equivalent of a quarter of the total global increase. However, increasing production while having limited reserves means that Brazil needs to find additional reserves or risk losing influence if its output falls in coming years, though it it still unlikely to drop from the list of highest oil consuming countries in the world anytime soon.6. Saudi ArabiaTotal consumption in 2020 (million barrels per day): 3,314Total consumption in 2021 (million barrels per day): 3,351Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest oil producers in the world, which has given it incredible influence on the world stage.Click to continue reading and see the top 5 countries with the highest oil consumption.Suggested articles:20 Most Respected Professions in the World10 Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Buying10 5G Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnDisclosure: None.

In fact, total noninterest expenses recorded a negative compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.7% over the last three years (ended 2022). Earlier, the bank expected noninterest expenses in 2023 to be flat compared to 2022.The company is dedicated to reduce its cost base by identifying additional cost-saving endeavors. These initiatives are expected to provide structural cost savings of more than €2 billion between 2022 and 2025. By 2025, DB expects the cost/income ratio to be below 62.5%.Deutsche Bank is also shifting focus from IB to more stable businesses, like private banks, corporate banks and asset management units. This is likely to aid revenues in the upcoming period.Over the past six months, shares of DB have increased 1.1% on the NYSE compared with the industry’s rise of 13.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, DB carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

MS has been considering cutting around 7% of jobs in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan). This is part of the broader 3,000 IB job cuts that the company announced earlier.Citigroup Inc. C expects a year-over-year decline in its trading and IB revenues in second-quarter 2023. At an industry conference, Mark Mason, the chief financial officer of Citigroup, said that trading revenues and IB revenues had been down 20% and 25%, respectively, so far this quarter.A slowdown in business activities has compelled the bank to reduce headcounts and expenses. C will reduce its headcount by 5,000 across the firm, primarily in the banking, markets and functions divisions.Mark Mason said the firm’s recent job cuts will cause expenses to climb as much as $400 million this quarter compared with the first three months of the year. Mason expects the bank's expenses in the second quarter of 2023 will be in the range of $300-$400 million higher sequentially, primarily attributed to severance costs tied to the leaving of 1,600 employees.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

34,5195b31a-0b31-31d1-9466-dd786f44ad39,MS,2023-06-17,Morgan Stanley's (MS) Inorganic Expansion Aids Amid High Costs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanleys-ms-inorganic-expansion-153700957.html,1686929820,STORY,['MS'],"[Morgan Stanley MS has been continuously making efforts to focus more on businesses that are less volatile revenue sources. Along with this, its inorganic growth efforts will likely keep supporting financials. However, elevated expenses and the uncertain performance of capital markets remain concerns.Morgan Stanley’s strategic buyouts, which aim to increase dependence on reliable revenue sources, are commendable. Driven by these efforts, its Wealth Management (""WM"") and Investment Management (""IM"") segments’ aggregate contribution to net revenues jumped to almost 55% in 2022 from 26% in 2010. However, the difficult operating backdrop in the near term is expected to hamper growth in WM and IM segments (as witnessed in the first quarter of 2023). We project both segments' contribution (in aggregate) to the top line to be more than 57% in 2023.Morgan Stanley has a solid balance sheet. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had long-term debt of $245.6 billion, with approximately $20.4 billion expected to mature within a year. The company’s average liquidity resources were $321.2 billion as of the same date. Owing to its sufficient liquidity position, MS is expected to continue to meet near-term debt obligations, even if the economic situation worsens.However, Morgan Stanley has witnessed a continuous rise in expenses. Though expenses declined in 2022, it witnessed a three-year (2019-2022) CAGR of 9.3%. The uptrend continued in the first quarter of 2023. Going forward, expenses are expected to remain elevated, given the steady increase in revenues (leading to higher compensation costs) and inflationary pressure, as well as the company’s investments in franchise and inorganic growth efforts. Our estimates for total non-interest expenses suggest an increase of 1% this year.The performance of Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities (""IS"") segment, constituting the trading and investment banking businesses, depends on the performance of the capital markets. The future performance of the segment remains uncertain as the current global economic and geopolitical environment continues to be influenced by elevated inflation, higher rates, worsening macroeconomic outlook and volatility across the global financial markets.Story continuesThough the company sees signs of growing M&amp;A and underwriting pipelines, the financial impact is expected in the second half of 2023 and in 2024. Hence, we expect the IS segment's revenues to decline 4.6% in 2023.Further, analysts are pessimistic about the stock’s earnings prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MS' 2023 and 2024 earnings has been revised marginally downward over the past 30 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past six months, shares of MS have gained 4.1% against the industry's 7.2% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFinance Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are HomeTrust Banshares, Inc.

35,8b408970-baf1-35c6-9190-819d114f3b91,OMC,2023-06-17,Omnicom Group's (NYSE:OMC) investors will be pleased with their favorable 100% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omnicom-groups-nyse-omc-investors-122739896.html,1687004859,STORY,['OMC'],"[By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) shareholders have seen the share price rise 78% over three years, well in excess of the market return (36%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 56% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Omnicom Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Omnicom Group was able to grow its EPS at 3.9% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 21% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Omnicom Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Omnicom Group, it has a TSR of 100% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Omnicom Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 56% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 9% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Omnicom Group (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Salesforce, Inc.

It's fair to say the stock has continued its long term trend in the last year, over which it has risen 30%.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the last half decade, Salesforce became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Salesforce's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Salesforce has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 30% in the last twelve months.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -0.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 14.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +59.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +17.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +42%. This estimate has changed +7.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.97 indicates a change of +20.6% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.52 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.4%. The $34.63 billion and $38.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.5% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.3%. EPS of $1.69 for the same period compares with $0.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +4.97%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, a solid online show and strong AUR growth bode well. It has been on track with its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.This led to a robust surprise trend, which continued in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. The fiscal fourth quarter marked the 11th and the ninth straight quarter of earnings and revenue beat, respectively.Adjusted earnings per share of 90 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter advanced 83.7% year over year from 49 cents in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues grew 1% year over year to $1,541 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,470 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 9% from the prior-year quarter.RL has been expanding digital and omnichannel capabilities through investments in mobile, omnichannel and fulfillment. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, digital business continued to be a key growth driver, with accelerated digital sales across all regions. The company’s global digital ecosystem witnessed year-over-year mid-single-digit revenue growth. This includes mid-single-digit growth within Ralph Lauren digital sites.The company introduced additional digital sites in key markets, including Korea and Australia. A positive mix of products, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition bode well. Also, its online search grew year over year and reached 52 million social media followers on a global basis.Region-wise, digital sales were up 6% in Europe and 19% in Asia. For fiscal 2024, management revealed plans for rich digital content and greater customer personalization. It remains focused on further digital investments to continue the creation of content for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve its consumers more efficiently.Ralph Lauren continues to scale and expand its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” endless aisle product availability and more. The company launched its first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app last holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform.Average unit retail (AUR) increased in the double-digits in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, marking the 24th straight AUR rise, driven by product mix elevation and lower air freight, partly offset by peak levels of raw material costs. The company’s strategy of product elevation, acquisition of new full-priced consumers and favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to support long-term AUR growth.Its “Next Great Chapter” plan, which includes creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities, performed well. The move enabled it to focus on core brands, as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy. Encouragingly, management is on track with the next phase of this plan, namely the Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.Driven by these factors, management issued upbeat guidance for fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2024, RL anticipates year-over-year revenue growth (cc) in the low-single digits, in sync with our estimate of 2.2% growth. This includes 20 basis points (bps) of positive impacts of currency.The operating margin is forecasted to expand 30-50 bps on a constant-currency basis to 12.3-12.5%, which includes a favorable impact of currency of 10 bps. Notably, the operating margin is envisioned to expand 50-100 bps on a constant-currency basis, driven by solid AUR and lower freight costs, which more than offset continued product cost inflation. Gross margin is likely to gain from lower freight costs, continued AUR growth and favorable product, geographic and channel mix.For the fiscal first quarter, the company anticipates revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. The operating margin is predicted to expand 30-50 basis points in constant currency, driven by stronger gross margins. Gross margin expansion is expected to be driven by lower freight costs and continued AUR growth, partly offset by increased product costs.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConsequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 35.4% in the past three months, outpacing the industry’s growth of 7.5%.However, the company has been reeling under continued product cost inflation and higher compensation. As a result, the fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted gross profit margin contracted 150 bps year over year on a reported basis. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% from the year-ago period to $908 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.Also, unfavorable currency impacts remain concerning. For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects adverse currency rates to hurt revenues by 150 bps. Meanwhile, the gross and operating margins are likely to witness 50 bps of adverse currency impacts each.Bottom LineAlthough cost inflation and currency woes remain concerning, we believe that Ralph Lauren is well-placed for long-term growth on the back of brand strength, robust demand, solid online show and strong AUR growth.Also, a Value Score of B and long-term earnings growth rate of 13.8% raise optimism in the stock. Topping it, earnings estimates for RL’s current financial year have increased 1.8% to $9.42 over the past 30 days.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries. TGLS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The chief executive officer of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation expects the demand from China for oil to keep improving in the second half of this year. Healthy crude pricing will thus make exploration and production activities profitable in the U.S. shale resources like Bakken. Companies that are thus well poised to gain are Hess Corporation HES, Marathon Oil Corporation MRO and ConocoPhillips COP.Oil Price Will Remain HandsomeBeth McDonald, executive vice president of Pioneer Natural, said at the RBN Energy crude export conference in Houston that amid limited supply growth, demand for crude across the globe continues to rise. This will lead oil price to be more handsome later this year.Higher labor and material expenses are hurting profit margins, thereby limiting spending by upstream players for exploration and production activities. Also, upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns than boosting output since investors ask companies to return more cash. These are the prime factors justifying limitations in supply growth as upstream companies will continue to focus on capital discipline, despite the recent decision by Saudi Arabia, the top producer of the OPEC cartel, to cut another 1 million barrels per day production from July.McDonald believes that over the next three to five years, crude will trade between $70 and $100 per barrel. At present, West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading higher than the $70 per barrel mark.Modest Rise in Shale Oil ProductionIn July, total oil production from shale resources in the United States will likely increase by 8,000 barrels per day to 9,375 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/D), per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The shale resources comprise Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Niobrara and Permian.Of all the resources, the Bakken will witness the highest increase in daily oil production next month, according to the EIA’s drilling productivity report. In Bakken, the EIA projects oil production to rise by 7,000 barrels per day to 1,214 MBbls/D in July.Story continuesBakken Explorers in the SpotlightIt is clear that a favorable crude pricing scenario is backing modestly higher production volumes. Improving Bakken production amid healthy oil prices has raised the incentive to keep an eye on stocks of companies operating in the prolific basin. We have zeroed in on three stocks that are well poised to gain. All the stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Stocks to GainIn the Bakken shale play, Hess Corporation has an industry-leading acreage position. With the employment of Lean manufacturing techniques, Hess’ has reduced its well operating costs significantly, while making those wells considerably more productive. While operating in the Bakken shale play, HES expects to maximize cashflows.Marathon Oil Corporation has a clear focus on operating in the prolific oil-rich shale plays in the United States, where the cost of operations is significantly low. Bakken is one of the key plays, where Marathon Oil has roughly 240,000 net acres. In Bakken, MRO plans to bring 70 to 80 wells to sales in 2023.ConocoPhillips’ major business unit is Lower 48, representing the company’s operations in key shale plays in the United States. Those low GHG-intensity assets, where operating costs are low, have huge upside potential. Bakken is among the assets in Lower 48, where ConocoPhillips currently has prime focus.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When AT&amp;T was buying DirecTV in 2015, the companies extended the termination date twice.The first fight will be in federal court in California, beginning on June 22 and running until June 29. The second, if it goes forward, is before a Federal Trade Commission administrative law judge and begins on Aug. 2.Here are four potential outcomes of the California hearing:* Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley may grant the preliminary injunction and the companies terminate. In the past, most companies which lose at this point have scrapped the proposed deal.* The judge may grant the preliminary injunction, the companies extend the deal deadline past July 18, and they take the fight to an FTC administrative law judge in August.* Corley may refuse to grant the preliminary injunction and the FTC drops the fight. This happened most recently with Meta Platforms' purchase of VR content maker Within Unlimited. The FTC lost in federal court and dropped the internal FTC challenge.* The judge may refuse to grant the preliminary injunction, and the agency fights on. That can be appealed to a federal appeals court. In any case, an administrative law judge at the FTC is scheduled to hear arguments about the deal in August.If the case goes to Michael Chappell, an FTC judge, as scheduled in August, here are the potential outcomes:* If Microsoft wins, the FTC staff can ask Chair Lina Khan and the commissioners, who voted to bring the case, to overturn the verdict. The next stop after that would be a federal appeals court. When Chappell ruled against the agency in Illumina's acquisition of Grail, Khan and commissioners overturned the decision and the case is now before an appeals court.* If the FTC wins, the companies can also appeal to the commission to overturn the decision and, if needed, take the case to an appeals court.(Reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

Some industry participants also provide business process services with capabilities in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation in the United States and abroad.What's Shaping the Future of the Outsourcing Industry?A Healthy Demand Environment: Increasing demand for expertise in improving efficiency and reducing costs has benefited the industry over the past several years. The industry has witnessed growth in revenues, income and cash flow over the past few years, enabling most players to pursue acquisitions and other investments, and pay out stable dividends.Story continuesRising Dependency on Technologies: Most of the industry participants are also considering emerging technologies such as cloud computing to drive competitive advantage, increase innovation, improve speed to market and drive performance within the industry. The wider application of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be the biggest change induced by the pandemic. The adoption of AI should lower complications and simplify operations. This should aid the industry.Notably, industry players are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes in order to keep themselves flexible in any kind of operating environment.Growing Security Issues and Remedies: Increased dependency on technology has led to growing cases of hacking, identity theft and malicious payload deliveries. With work-from-home models being the new-normal professional scenario, remote infrastructure vulnerabilities and security gaps are being exploited to secure unauthorized access to proprietary systems and data.As a preventive measure to enhance data security and ensure cyber-resilience, secure access technologies such as VPNs, two-factor authentication and other ID and access-management controls for home workers, as well as increased monitoring and threat-detection tools, are being used. Outsourced service providers are also updating organizational policies (including Bring Your Own Device and work-from-home policies) and data breach protocols in order to reduce security risks. Adequate training of employees about emerging threats and data security issues is also being prioritized by several companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #84.

54,bb16c1d9-2ff7-3ca1-ad38-bd1bad9fae8b,SBUX,2023-06-17,Starbucks (SBUX) Up 41% in the Past Year: More Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-sbux-41-past-more-134700317.html,1686923220,STORY,"['SBUX', 'ARCO']","[Starbucks Corporation SBUX is poised to benefit from menu innovation, solid comps growth and expansion initiatives. Also, a focus on digitization bodes well.Shares of Starbucks have rallied 41% in the past year compared with the industry’s 34.1% growth. An upward revision in earnings estimates for 2023 reflects analysts’ optimism regarding the company’s growth potential. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings has moved up 0.9% to $3.43 per share.Major Growth DriversStarbucks is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation in beverages, refreshments, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. SBUX is leaning toward fast-growing categories like Cold Brew, Draft Nitro beverages and plant-based modifiers, including almond, coconut, and soy milk alternatives.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchApart from numerous beverage innovations, Starbucks has been making an effort to offer more nutritional and healthy products to its customers. Starbucks’ collaboration with Beyond Meat to roll out a plant-based lunch menu in China is a testament to the same.In February 2023, the company launched the Starbucks Oleato range of beverages available in 650 stores across Italy, Japan and the United States. The range of beverages received a fair amount of success due to which the company plans to expand its availability in more markets in 2023.Starbucks witnessed solid comps growth in all its operational segments in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, attributable to an increase in comparable transactions and the average ticket. In the reported quarter, North America comps grew 12% due to a 6% rise in comparable transactions and a 5% increase in the average ticket.International comps also grew 7%, driven by a 7% increase in comparable transactions. Global comps increased 11%, mainly because of a 6% rise in comparable transactions and a 4% increase in the average ticket.Starbucks is one of the most recognized coffee brands in the world. Management has been focused on increasing the global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and existing markets, remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs and aggressive product innovation and brand building.Story continuesIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company opened 464 net new stores globally, reflecting a total store count of 36,634. During fiscal 2023, SBUX expects the store count in the United States and China to grow approximately 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The company expects global store growth of nearly 7%.Starbucks is focusing on digitalization to boost growth. The company’s partnership with Alibaba for providing a seamless Starbucks Experience continues to drive growth in China.Starbucks has introduced its mobile order and pay feature — Starbucks Now — to multiple platforms in the Alibaba Digital Economy, which includes Taobao, Amap, Koubei and Alipay. The company made progress in personalized digital relationships to expand its reach with members. This includes program enhancements like Stars for Everyone.SBUX is exploring the blockchain platform for ways to connect the Starbucks Rewards program with other merchant reward programs, coupled with the motive of the tokenization of stars. The initiative paves a path for the exchange of value across brands, enhanced digital services and swapping other loyalty points for stars. Going forward, the company is likely to highlight this format as it is likely to serve as the foundation for a new modern payment that aligns expenses with the value received by customers and merchants.ConcernsStarbucks is facing restrictions in its potential growth due to persisting inflationary pressure related to the commodity and supply chain. In the fiscal second quarter, general and administrative expenses increased 28.8% year over year to $620.4 million. The upside was mainly driven by investments in technology, higher performance-based compensations, increased support costs of strategic initiatives (including the Reinvention Plan) and higher costs related to partner wages and benefits.The company anticipates inflationary pressures to persist for some time. In fiscal 2023, our model predicts total operating expenses to rise 10.3% year over year.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksStarbucks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are as follows:Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). CMG has a long-term earnings growth rate of 31.8%.

55,6d6df4b3-1ca9-3809-b811-381485d9dcf9,ADM,2023-06-17,Top 20 Largest Consumer Staples Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-largest-consumer-staples-163350027.html,1686933230,STORY,"['KHC', 'KMB', 'ADM', 'TGT', 'PM', 'GIS', 'MNST', 'MO', 'CL', 'MDLZ', 'HSY', 'UL']","[In this article, we will take a look at the top 20 largest consumer staples companies in the world. If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the consumer staples industry and just want to take a look at the top five biggest consumer staples companies in the world, then head on over to Top 5 Largest Consumer Staples Companies in the World.Forbes reports that there is a 68.2% possibility that the United States will experience a recession at some point in the upcoming year, according to the New York Fed's recession probability indicator, which is at its highest level in more than four decades. In light of this circumstance, investors would prefer to focus on sectors, such as the consumer staples sector, that are thought to be more stable and recession-proof.The consumer staples sector includes stocks of companies that manufacture essential goods such as food, beverages, household goods, and personal care items that people purchase to sustain their daily life, regardless of the state of the economy or their own financial situation. Furthermore, the companies in the sector usually offer regular dividends to investors because of their consistent capacity to generate profits. Consequently, in times of economic uncertainty, the stocks of these companies are relatively stable investments.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the consumer staples sector significantly outperformed the broad market in 2022 despite high inflation, and the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index gained 0.37% through December 9, 2022, as opposed to a 16.17% drop in the S&amp;P 500.Moreover, this sector also lived up to its reputation during the height of COVID-19 pandemic as a number of major consumer staples companies, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), prospered as a result of consumers stocking up on items like diapers, soaps, toilet paper and sodas amid widespread lockdowns around the globe to limit the spread of coronavirus. On the contrary, we witnessed that earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector were negatively affected as people cut down on non-essential spending such as travel and entertainment. Don’t Miss: 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy.Story continuesConsumer Staples ETFsIf inflation persists or the US economy enters a recession, investors can still increase their exposure to consumer staples sector in a less risky way by investing in consumer staples ETFs over consumer staples stocks.An exchange-traded fund that invests in consumer staples equities is known as a consumer staples ETF. ETFs are a popular investment option for many reasons. ETFs provide diversity by enabling investors to access several stocks with a single investment rather than having to buy each stock separately. Because their volatility is lower than that of individual stocks, ETFs offer more stability.Some examples of consumer staples ETFs include iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC) among others.Bearing these details in mind, let's look at the consumer staples giants of the world.

56,801d7fd2-e066-33d6-93a3-2e4de4bdbbba,ADM,2023-06-17,4 Agriculture Operations Stocks to Watch in a Distressed Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-agriculture-operations-stocks-watch-141800744.html,1686925080,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'LMNR', 'CTVA', 'ADM', 'AGRO']","[Higher investment costs and SG&amp;A expense continue to mar the profitability of the companies participating in the Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry. Logistic and supply-chain issues, higher input costs, and elevated operational expenses have been affecting industry players for a while. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressure have been affecting results.Nonetheless, the industry is poised to benefit from innovations and improved consumer demand for healthy products. Investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and expansions are likely to fortify the prospects of the industry players. Continued investments in assets and technological capabilities to innovate and serve customers bode well for players like Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM, Corteva Inc. CTVA, Adecoagro S.A. AGRO and Limoneira Co LMNR.About the IndustryThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry comprises companies that produce or procure, transport, store, process, and distribute agricultural commodities to consumers. It also distributes ingredients to other parts of the agriculture industry (including clothing, animal feed, energy and industrial product). Some industry players engage in dairy operations, land transformation activities and the development of food ingredients using gene-editing technology. The industry encompasses production activities related to traditional farming of crops (like corn, soybean, wheat and cotton), and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy and eggs). The products are mostly sold at grocery stores or exported overseas. These are also used as feedstock for other industries. For example, cotton is used in the clothing industry and corn is used in the ethanol industry.Factors Shaping the Future of Agriculture - Operations IndustryElevated Costs: Industry participants have been witnessing higher costs due to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs, including constraints in labor and trucking resources, leading to higher lead times for deliveries. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressure have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while. The companies have resorted to pricing strategies to counter rising raw material costs. The industry participants are looking to counter the global supply-chain challenges by forming partnerships and distribution strategies. Despite the pricing strategies, supply-chain challenges and cost inflation are expected to continue hurting margins in the near term. Companies in the industry continue to face raised SG&amp;A expenses due to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs, commissions and variable compensation. The companies are also witnessing elevated costs for investments in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the race. Continued deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses may continue to have a bearing on the profitability of companies.Agricultural Export Projections: Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, agricultural export projections for fiscal 2023 (ending Sep 30) of $181 billion suggest a decline of $3.5 billion from the February forecast of a record $183.5 billion. The export forecasts have been affected by declines in commodity groups, including corn, wheat, grain and feed exports and livestock, poultry, and dairy. Corn exports are expected to decline due to lower unit values and volumes as Brazil is poised to harvest a record second crop of corn. Wheat exports are expected to be impacted by lower volumes and unit values, as well as increased competition. Overall grain and feed exports are projected at $40.5 billion, down $3.3 billion from February. Total livestock, poultry, and dairy exports will reflect declines in beef and poultry exports, more than offsetting the increases in pork exports.Robust Demand Trends for Organic Products: The industry has been benefiting from an organic movement, prompted by consumers’ increasing demand for healthier food. Agriculturists are adopting organic production techniques, and curtailing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Innovations in food processing, improved grain-handling techniques, larger storage spaces and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry’s growth. Healthy eating habits are likely to accelerate the purchase and consumption of alternative proteins. Focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the forefront. The companies have been investing in acquisitions and joint ventures to build top-notch ingredients and solutions for meeting the demand for healthy products.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Synopsys (SNPS) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software used to test and develop chips is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Synopsys is 22.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 21.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 8.3%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Synopsys is 25.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 31.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.7%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Synopsys. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.4% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Synopsys a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Synopsys well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the consumer staples industry and just want to take a look at the top five biggest consumer staples companies in the world, then head on over to Top 5 Largest Consumer Staples Companies in the World.Forbes reports that there is a 68.2% possibility that the United States will experience a recession at some point in the upcoming year, according to the New York Fed's recession probability indicator, which is at its highest level in more than four decades. In light of this circumstance, investors would prefer to focus on sectors, such as the consumer staples sector, that are thought to be more stable and recession-proof.The consumer staples sector includes stocks of companies that manufacture essential goods such as food, beverages, household goods, and personal care items that people purchase to sustain their daily life, regardless of the state of the economy or their own financial situation. Furthermore, the companies in the sector usually offer regular dividends to investors because of their consistent capacity to generate profits. Consequently, in times of economic uncertainty, the stocks of these companies are relatively stable investments.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the consumer staples sector significantly outperformed the broad market in 2022 despite high inflation, and the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index gained 0.37% through December 9, 2022, as opposed to a 16.17% drop in the S&amp;P 500.Moreover, this sector also lived up to its reputation during the height of COVID-19 pandemic as a number of major consumer staples companies, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), prospered as a result of consumers stocking up on items like diapers, soaps, toilet paper and sodas amid widespread lockdowns around the globe to limit the spread of coronavirus. On the contrary, we witnessed that earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector were negatively affected as people cut down on non-essential spending such as travel and entertainment. Don’t Miss: 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy.Story continuesConsumer Staples ETFsIf inflation persists or the US economy enters a recession, investors can still increase their exposure to consumer staples sector in a less risky way by investing in consumer staples ETFs over consumer staples stocks.An exchange-traded fund that invests in consumer staples equities is known as a consumer staples ETF. ETFs are a popular investment option for many reasons. ETFs provide diversity by enabling investors to access several stocks with a single investment rather than having to buy each stock separately. Because their volatility is lower than that of individual stocks, ETFs offer more stability.Some examples of consumer staples ETFs include iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC) among others.Bearing these details in mind, let's look at the consumer staples giants of the world.

After all, as an income investor, you just received a raise.But the hikes often mean more than just a company being generous. Dividend increases can also be an indication that the company feels its future earnings will be sufficient to cover the increase being given to its shareholders.This is especially true with real estate investment trusts (REITs) that are mandated by law to pay out a minimum of 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. A dividend hike can be an indirect way of letting shareholders know its taxable income may soon increase.Don't miss:Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the airline industry and skip to the top 5 airlines, check out 5 Best Airlines in the World in 2023. We previously reported that according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 2023 is the year that the airline industry will see its net profits doubling to approximately $10 billion, while operating profits surpass $22.4 billion. It is forecasted that more than 4.35 billion passengers will board flights in 2023, which is close to the 2019 levels, when 4.54 billion flew throughout the year. Revenues are also projected to exceed $800 billion this year, which suggests a solid recovery in the airline industry. IATA ascribes this strong performance to China lifting its COVID-zero policies, high cargo revenues despite the volume remaining lower than pre-pandemic levels, and moderating jet fuel prices. A KPMG report suggests that the global airline industry plummeted by $140 billion in 2020, recorded a $42 billion loss in 2021, and the loss for 2022 came in at $6.9 billion. The pandemic had a devastating impact on travel and leisure activities, but the airline industry is set to return to profitability next year. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the number of air passengers in 2022 rose about 47% compared to the prior year, and revenue passenger kilometers climbed by 70% during the same time. ICAO attributed this recovery in the industry to robust international travel. ICAO also noted growth of about 50% in the annual passenger revenues of airlines from 2021 to 2022, while keeping the yield and exchange rates aligned with 2019 levels. Another solid signal of recovery in the airline industry was the growing number of aircraft orders and deliveries by Airbus and Boeing. In 2022, these aircraft manufacturers received 53% more orders and delivered 20% more aircrafts as compared to 2021. The aircraft orders in 2022 surpassed 2019 levels. ICAO Council President Salvatore Sciacchitano commented: Story continues“Assuring the safe, secure, and sustainable recovery of air services will be key to restoring aviation’s ability to act as a catalyst for sustainable development at the local, national and global levels, and will consequently be vital to countries’ recovery from the broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”Don't Miss: Top 20 Most Profitable Airlines in the WorldAnother development in the airline industry is the introduction of electric air taxis. Commercial airlines are looking to invest in electric air taxis, as they will make trips to airports quicker for passengers and will potentially reduce wait times at the airports as a result. For example, CNBC reported that in October 2022, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) invested $60 million in Joby Aviation, Inc. (NYSE:JOBY), a company that manufactures electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), which will operate as air taxis. This investment resulted in a five-year partnership between the companies, where Joby’s eVTOLs will operate solely in Delta’s network. Similarly, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) partnered with Heart Aerospace, a Swedish startup, to get electric aircrafts running by 2030. United Airlines has two prior investments in eVTOLs – one for $15 million with Eve Air Mobility, which will supply 200 aircrafts, and another with Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE:ACHR) worth $10 million for 100 aircrafts. Additionally, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) also invested $25 million in Vertical Aerospace, a UK-based manufacturer of eVTOLs. American Airlines placed an order for 50 aircrafts. Savanthi Syth, the managing director of equity research at Raymond James who covers global airlines and mobility, noted that these agreements between airlines and eVTOL manufacturers are not concrete and depend largely on regulations and the ability of companies to produce them. Syth commented: “We think that you’ll see small amounts of [eVTOL] operations starting in the 2025 timeframe, with certifications hopefully happening in 2024. But for you to see a lot of aircraft flying overhead, it’s probably going to be more likely into the 2030s.”In the constantly evolving airline industry, there are too many options for passengers to choose from. Most individuals prefer airlines with the best safety, reliability, service, and quality ratings to ensure a smooth journey, so they are keen to check airline ratings from best to worst before making a decision. While some of the best airline stocks include Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), in this article we discuss the top 20 airlines in the world. Our Methodology For this article, we selected the top rated airlines by AirlineRatings.com and Skytrax World Airline Awards. As of June 15, 2023, Skytrax Awards had the latest airline ranking data for 2022. So we chose the 2022 data from both sources and came up with an average ranking method for our list. We chose an average ranking method since the criteria that the airlines are assessed on is fairly subjective, and averaging out the scores by these two organizations usually produces a better outcome. AirlineRatings.com and Skytrax World Airline Awards rank airlines based on safety records, on-time performance, comfort and amenities, quality of service, frequent flyer programs and loyalty rewards, international network and routes, environmental and sustainability initiatives, and price competitiveness, among others. 20 Best Airlines in the World in 2023Mikhail Starodubov/Shutterstock.comBest Airlines in the World in 202320.

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the consumer staples industry and just want to take a look at the top five biggest consumer staples companies in the world, then head on over to Top 5 Largest Consumer Staples Companies in the World.Forbes reports that there is a 68.2% possibility that the United States will experience a recession at some point in the upcoming year, according to the New York Fed's recession probability indicator, which is at its highest level in more than four decades. In light of this circumstance, investors would prefer to focus on sectors, such as the consumer staples sector, that are thought to be more stable and recession-proof.The consumer staples sector includes stocks of companies that manufacture essential goods such as food, beverages, household goods, and personal care items that people purchase to sustain their daily life, regardless of the state of the economy or their own financial situation. Furthermore, the companies in the sector usually offer regular dividends to investors because of their consistent capacity to generate profits. Consequently, in times of economic uncertainty, the stocks of these companies are relatively stable investments.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the consumer staples sector significantly outperformed the broad market in 2022 despite high inflation, and the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index gained 0.37% through December 9, 2022, as opposed to a 16.17% drop in the S&amp;P 500.Moreover, this sector also lived up to its reputation during the height of COVID-19 pandemic as a number of major consumer staples companies, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), prospered as a result of consumers stocking up on items like diapers, soaps, toilet paper and sodas amid widespread lockdowns around the globe to limit the spread of coronavirus. On the contrary, we witnessed that earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector were negatively affected as people cut down on non-essential spending such as travel and entertainment.

ETFs are a popular investment option for many reasons. ETFs provide diversity by enabling investors to access several stocks with a single investment rather than having to buy each stock separately. Because their volatility is lower than that of individual stocks, ETFs offer more stability.Some examples of consumer staples ETFs include iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC) among others.Bearing these details in mind, let's look at the consumer staples giants of the world.

You can skip our detailed analysis of GARP investment and the performance of these stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends. If there is one thing the market has taught investors this past year, it is the importance of diversifying portfolios to reduce risk. Choosing stocks in different economic conditions has consistently posed challenges for investors because what works in one market may not work in another. For example, growth and value equities have exhibited varied performances over different time periods and market conditions, making them equally popular among investors. So, combining the elements of both strategies can offer investors a much-needed way out from traditional investment plans. This is where the GARP strategy comes in. Growth at a Reasonable Price, or GARP, is a relatively lesser-known investment approach that seeks to identify companies with sustainable earnings growth and attractive valuations relative to their growth prospects. These companies may operate in industries or sectors with favorable growth trends or possess competitive advantages that can drive their future growth.Popularized by Peter Lynch, the GARP strategy’s main goal is to avoid the extremes of either growth or value investing, which leads investors to growth-oriented stocks with relatively low price-to-earnings ratios in normal market conditions. If successfully identified, these stocks have the potential to generate positive returns for shareholders. Historically, the S&amp;P 500 GARP Index has delivered higher returns than its underlying benchmark. The index tracks the performance of companies with consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuation, and strong earnings power. Some of the best GARP stocks in the index are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).  In the past 12 months, the index gained 12.7%.Story continuesAccording to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 GARP delivered an annual average return of 13.2% from June 1995 to June 2019, compared with a 9.81% growth of the S&amp;P 500. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index and the S&amp;P 500 Enhanced Value Index returned 10.41% and 11.83%, respectively. The report also mentioned that the GARP Index’s risk-adjusted returns during the above-mentioned period were higher than growth and value indices.Also read: 12 Best Fast Growth Stocks to Buy NowCPI’s latest report shows that consumer prices rose 4% this May, down from 4.9% in April. This cooling inflation also signals a pause in interest rate hikes, giving investors room to take a breather from the longest streak of increases. However, this does not imply that the stock market is out of the perils as investors still need meticulous investment plans. BMO Capital’s chief strategist Brian Belski advised Canadian investors to follow the GARP strategy this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) remains one of our key style preferences for Canadian equities in 2023. Furthermore, earnings growth and revision trends are broadly consistent with the S&amp;P 500, suggesting there are likely many opportunities developing in Canada to implement a growth at a reasonable price strategy.”CNBC report also highlighted remarks of BMO’s analysts about the possible investment strategies to navigate the market uncertainties in the US. The report mentioned that investors should use GARP and dividend growth approaches in the current financial environment. Dividend stocks have proved their mettle in previous inflationary periods, becoming popular among investors.

The company’s management team is focusing on profitable growth through its Better, not Bigger strategy which should improve margins and future opportunities for the company.

70,7f9b632b-cc13-370f-9170-3bbef35179f3,HOLX,2023-06-17,Surmodics' (SRDX) Receipt of New FDA Nod to Boost Patient Care,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surmodics-srdx-receipt-fda-nod-152000551.html,1686928800,STORY,"['SRDX', 'HOLX', 'BSX']","[Surmodics, Inc. SRDX announced its receipt of the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its Pounce LP (Low Profile) Thrombectomy System. The system, which is the latest addition to its Pounce platform, is indicated for use in vessels ranging from 2 mm to 4 mm in diameter, which are typical sizes of vessels found below the knee.Surmodics expects to initiate limited market evaluation (LME) for the Pounce LP Thrombectomy System by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company is planning the commercialization following the completion of the LME.The latest regulatory clearance is expected to boost Surmodics’ vascular intervention medical devices business under the broader Medical Device segment and solidify its foothold in the niche space.Significance of the ApprovalThe Pounce Thrombectomy System was introduced in 2021 and was intended for the non-surgical removal of thrombi (a blood clot that forms in a vein) and emboli (anything that moves through the blood vessels until it reaches a vessel that is too small to let it pass) from the peripheral arterial vasculature in vessels of 3.5 mm to 6 mm in diameter. The Pounce LP Thrombectomy System is expected to allow efficient clot removal in below-the-knee peripheral arteries. This will likely expand the addressable market for the Pounce platform.Per management, the latest FDA approval is expected to extend the range of treatment for the Pounce platform to include the removal of organized thrombotic or embolic occlusions in smaller vessels below the knee. Catheter-directed thrombolysis in these vessels is limited against organized clots and requires ICU admission, while small-diameter aspiration thrombectomy devices may struggle to remove organized material in the distal lower extremity.Following the FDA’s clearance, the treatment range of the Pounce platform is likely to be expanded to address tibial clots, an important component of treatment in this vulnerable patient population. This, in turn, is likely to boost patient outcomes.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global thrombectomy devices market was valued at $1.3 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $2.6 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 7.4%. Factors like the increase in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and growth in demand for minimally invasive procedures are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance raises optimism about Surmodics.Notable DevelopmentIn April, Surmodics reported its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it witnessed a solid uptick in the overall top line. The company registered robust revenues in its Medical Device segment as well as in its Product sales, and Research, development and other revenues. During the quarter, Surmodics saw strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.The same month, Surmodics announced the enrollment of the first patient in PROWL, the Pounce Thrombectomy System Retrospective Registry. PROWL is an open-label, retrospective, multi-center U.S. registry of the Surmodics Pounce system for the non-surgical removal of emboli and thrombi in the peripheral arterial vasculature.Also, in April, Surmodics announced the first usage of the company’s Sublime radial access microcatheter. The Sublime microcatheter is currently in limited market evaluation. The full suite of Sublime microcatheters will be launched in fiscal 2024.Price PerformanceShares of Surmodics have lost 29.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 19.8% decline. The S&amp;P 500 has risen 20.5% in the said time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Surmodics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Shares of Apple, Amazon, and Disney have returned 43.2%, 51.3% and 7%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company's prospects remain bright due to a diversified content portfolio, cheaper ad-supported plans and a password-sharing initiative despite stiff competition from Disney, Apple and Amazon.Netflix’s ad-supported cheaper plans are gaining user attention. It launched its ad-supported service on Nov 3, 2022, with the basic plan costing $6.99 a month in the United States.Netflix launched its paid password-sharing model in the United States on May 23, notifying members that their accounts cannot be shared for free with users outside their households.According to Antenna, NFLX experienced an increase in subscribers during the four days following the announcement.

The company is likely to give Prime subscribers the option to pay more for an ad-free alternative if it introduces ads in Prime Video.Nevertheless, Netflix is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content.For the second quarter of 2023, total revenues are anticipated to be $8.242 billion, suggesting growth of 3.4% year over year or 6% on a forex-neutral basis.

74,6eab6617-1d63-3268-a73a-2f6a439f45a5,TJX,2023-06-17,Ralph Lauren (RL) is Marching Ahead of the Industry: Here's How,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-marching-ahead-151200642.html,1686928320,STORY,"['RL', 'TJX']","[Ralph Lauren RL has been gaining from brand strength, solid demand, as well as expansion across all channels. Also, a solid online show and strong AUR growth bode well. It has been on track with its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.This led to a robust surprise trend, which continued in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. The fiscal fourth quarter marked the 11th and the ninth straight quarter of earnings and revenue beat, respectively.Adjusted earnings per share of 90 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter advanced 83.7% year over year from 49 cents in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues grew 1% year over year to $1,541 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,470 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 9% from the prior-year quarter.RL has been expanding digital and omnichannel capabilities through investments in mobile, omnichannel and fulfillment. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, digital business continued to be a key growth driver, with accelerated digital sales across all regions. The company’s global digital ecosystem witnessed year-over-year mid-single-digit revenue growth. This includes mid-single-digit growth within Ralph Lauren digital sites.The company introduced additional digital sites in key markets, including Korea and Australia. A positive mix of products, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition bode well. Also, its online search grew year over year and reached 52 million social media followers on a global basis.Region-wise, digital sales were up 6% in Europe and 19% in Asia. For fiscal 2024, management revealed plans for rich digital content and greater customer personalization. It remains focused on further digital investments to continue the creation of content for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve its consumers more efficiently.Ralph Lauren continues to scale and expand its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” endless aisle product availability and more. The company launched its first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app last holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform.Average unit retail (AUR) increased in the double-digits in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, marking the 24th straight AUR rise, driven by product mix elevation and lower air freight, partly offset by peak levels of raw material costs. The company’s strategy of product elevation, acquisition of new full-priced consumers and favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to support long-term AUR growth.Its “Next Great Chapter” plan, which includes creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities, performed well. The move enabled it to focus on core brands, as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy. Encouragingly, management is on track with the next phase of this plan, namely the Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.Driven by these factors, management issued upbeat guidance for fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2024, RL anticipates year-over-year revenue growth (cc) in the low-single digits, in sync with our estimate of 2.2% growth. This includes 20 basis points (bps) of positive impacts of currency.The operating margin is forecasted to expand 30-50 bps on a constant-currency basis to 12.3-12.5%, which includes a favorable impact of currency of 10 bps. Notably, the operating margin is envisioned to expand 50-100 bps on a constant-currency basis, driven by solid AUR and lower freight costs, which more than offset continued product cost inflation. Gross margin is likely to gain from lower freight costs, continued AUR growth and favorable product, geographic and channel mix.For the fiscal first quarter, the company anticipates revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. The operating margin is predicted to expand 30-50 basis points in constant currency, driven by stronger gross margins. Gross margin expansion is expected to be driven by lower freight costs and continued AUR growth, partly offset by increased product costs.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConsequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 35.4% in the past three months, outpacing the industry’s growth of 7.5%.However, the company has been reeling under continued product cost inflation and higher compensation. As a result, the fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted gross profit margin contracted 150 bps year over year on a reported basis. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% from the year-ago period to $908 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.Also, unfavorable currency impacts remain concerning. For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects adverse currency rates to hurt revenues by 150 bps. Meanwhile, the gross and operating margins are likely to witness 50 bps of adverse currency impacts each.Bottom LineAlthough cost inflation and currency woes remain concerning, we believe that Ralph Lauren is well-placed for long-term growth on the back of brand strength, robust demand, solid online show and strong AUR growth.Also, a Value Score of B and long-term earnings growth rate of 13.8% raise optimism in the stock. Topping it, earnings estimates for RL’s current financial year have increased 1.8% to $9.42 over the past 30 days.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

This Minneapolis, MN-based company with a strong history of dividend payments provide a hedge against any odd swings in the stock market.This general merchandise retailer once again rewarded investors with a hike in the dividend payout. Target’s board of directors raised the quarterly dividend by 1.9% to $1.10 per share. The new dividend will be paid out on Sep 10, 2023, to its shareholders of record at the close of the business on Aug 16, 2023. Last June, Target hiked its regular quarterly dividend by 20% to $1.08.Backed by sound fundamentals and financial strength, Target has time and again highlighted its commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We note that net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,265 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The current hike marks the 52nd successive year of a dividend increase.We believe that such strategic steps not only drive shareholder value but also raise the market value of the stock. Through these dividend increases, companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip. People looking for regular income from stocks are most likely to choose companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payouts.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMore About the StockTarget has been undertaking several strategic endeavors — new stores, owned brand innovations, national brand partnerships, the expansion of same-day services or the rollout of sortation centers — to drive engagement, traffic and market share gains. These have been contributing to the company’s sales performance. Target witnessed stellar demand in frequency categories, such as Food &amp; Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Management intends to spend approximately $4-$5 billion in fiscal 2023 to continue scaling operations, reaching new customers as it builds capacity and enhances services and supply-chain facilities. To simplify and improve efficiencies across the business, Target has announced an enterprise-wide cost-containment effort. Through the initiative, the company plans to save between $2 billion and $3 billion over the next three years.Target has been directing resources toward expanding digital and omnichannel capabilities. The company has been ramping up its digital solutions and strengthening delivery capabilities to make shopping more seamless. Its services like doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store have been playing a crucial role in serving consumers better.We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have fallen 7.5% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 0.2%. The stock came under pressure following Target’s soft second-quarter comparable sales guidance. Target envisions second-quarter comparable sales to decline in the low single digits. It foresees greater SG&amp;A rate pressure in the second quarter. As a result, the operating margin rate is likely to decline on a sequential basis.Story continues3 Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Kroger KR, The TJX Companies TJX and Walmart WMT.Kroger, a supermarket operator, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

76,8f44d1df-1222-3edf-91f4-ecdf09a6cc94,TJX,2023-06-17,4 Solid Retail Stocks to Buy on Continued Rise in Sales,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-solid-retail-stocks-buy-121900882.html,1686917940,STORY,"['URBN', 'TJX', 'ANF', 'CASY']","[The retail sector has been putting up a great fight amid ongoing inflationary pressures that have seen people spend cautiously. According to the latest data released by the Commerce Department, retail sales rose for the second straight month in May, indicating that people are still willing to spend as demand, despite slowing down, is still elevated.The report comes as data showed that both consumer price and producer price inflation slowed in May. Slowing inflation finally led the Fed to keep its interest rates unchanged, which is a positive sign for the retail sector. Given this situation, retail stocks are expected to benefit in the near term.Retail Sales Grow in MayU.S. retail sales grew 0.3% in May after rising 0.4% in April and beating economists’ expectations of a 0.1% decline, the Commerce Department said on Jun 15. On a year-over-year basis, retail sales jumped a solid 1.6% in May.Except for gasoline stations and other general merchandise retailers, spending increased across almost all categories. Excluding sales at gas stations, retail sales grew at a faster rate of 0.6%.Online sales rose 0.3%, while sales at food services and drinking places rose 0.4%. Restaurants and bars are the only service category in the monthly sales report.May’s jump was driven by a 1.4% jump in sales at auto dealers. Sales at retailers of gardening and building products increased 2.2%.Consumers have cut down on spending over the past several months as higher prices have been pinching their pockets. However, the U.S. economy is holding up well in the face of the Fed’s 500 basis points hike in interest rates over the past year.The Fed finally decided to keep interest rates unchanged in its recently concluded June policy meeting although it might need to increase interest rates by another 50 basis points by the end of the year.The Fed’s decision to halt interest rate hikes is definitely a positive sign for the retail sector as this will help boost investor sentiment. This is due to the fact that increasing interest rates may have an impact on stock market performance, consumer spending, and borrowing costs.Story continuesThe retail sales report comes just days after data showed that inflation slowed in May. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 4% in May, down from April's rise of 4.9%, according to the most recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released on Jun 13. Additionally, the reading for May was slightly below the analysts' projection of 4.1%.Retail inflation dropped significantly in May, falling to its lowest level since March 2021, mostly due to a sharp drop in fuel costs. The decline in overall inflation has also been aided by groceries prices.Gas prices fell by roughly 6% in May on a seasonally adjusted basis. In addition, the annual increase in food prices dropped from its peak of 13.5% to 5.8% in May.Also, producer prices decreased more than expected in May, according to the Producer Price Index (PPI) data released on Jun 14. The PPI has decreased in three of the previous five months, according to the Labor Department, falling 0.3% in May after rising 0.2% in April.The increase in producer inflation in May was likewise the smallest increase in nearly two and a half years.Our ChoicesUrban Outfitters, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week’s 5.0% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 1.1% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amgen. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Amgen already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amgen, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Amgen is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.1% and 5.5% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of AmgenThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Amgen Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$199m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Amgen. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

ABBV announced top-line data from the phase III maintenance study, COMMAND, which evaluated its IL-23 drug Skyrizi (risankizumab) in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (“UC”) indication.Data from the COMMAND study showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with Skyrizi (180mg or 360mg, administered subcutaneously) achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 52.40% and 38% of study participants who received the 180mg and 360mg dose of the drug, respectively, achieved clinical remission, compared to 25% of patients enrolled in the control group.Study participants who were administered Skyrizi also achieved endoscopic improvement, histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement and steroid-free remission following 52 weeks of treatment, which were also the study’s key secondary endpoints. The drug’s safety profile was consistent with the data from prior studies in other indications.Currently, Skyrizi is approved by the FDA for three indications, which are plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and Crohn’s disease (“CD”).Shares of AbbVie have declined 15.9% so far this year against the industry’s 0.6% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe COMMAND study enrolled only those patients who had responded to induction treatment with the drug in the phase III INSPIRE study. In March, AbbVie reported top-line data from the INSPIRE study, wherein treatment with an intravenous 1200mg dose of Skyrizi achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 12.The targeted UC market is highly competitive. AbbVie faces stiff competition from Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, which markets its own drug Stelara which utilizes a similar mechanism of action to treat the CD indication.A blockbuster drug, J&amp;J’s Stelara is a human IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist approved by the FDA for treating moderately to severely active UC. The drug is also approved for other indications, including psoriasis, CD and PsA. Evidently, Stelara is one of J&amp;J’s top-line drivers. During first-quarter 2023, J&amp;J recorded revenues worth $2.4 billion from Stelara sales.Story continuesLast month, the FDA approved AbbVie’s blockbuster JAK inhibitor Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active CD who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor blockers. The approval marks the seventh FDA-approved indication for Rinvoq across rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology. Apart from CD, Rinvoq is also approved for rheumatoid arthritis, PsA, UC, ankylosing spondylitis and eczema indications.AbbVie is focused on strengthening its focus on new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, to lessen its dependence on Humira, a major top-line driver for AbbVie, which recently lost exclusivity in the United States. Both Skyrizi and Rinvoq demonstrated differentiated clinical profiles, compared to Humira.Over the years, AbbVie’s Humira sales have been steadily declining due to biosimilars eroding the ex-U.S. sales of the drug. Humira’s international sales are already eroding due to the launch of several direct biosimilar drugs in Europe by other pharma companies, including Amgen AMGN, Novartis’ NVS Sandoz division and Biogen. Companies like Amgen, Novartis and Biogen were the first to start commercializing a Humira-biosimilar in Europe in 2018.In January, Amgen announced the launch of the first Humira biosimilar in the United States. The biosimilar is being marketed by Amgen under the trade name Amjevita. Like Amgen, several other companies like Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim and Pfizer have also received FDA approvals for their own Humira biosimilars, many of which are expected to be launched at various times this year per agreements with AbbVie. In March 2023, Novartis (through its Sandoz division) announced that the FDA had approved its Humira biosimilar, which will be marketed under the trade name Hyrimoz. The Novartis division intends to market the drug in the United States from July 1, 2023.With many new indications coming in the next couple of years, AbbVie expects sales of Skyrizi and Rinvoq to be higher and potentially replace Humira. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are expected to collectively exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira by 2027. Management expects the combined sales (risk-adjusted) of Skyrizi and Rinvoq to be more than $17.5 billion in 2025 and more than $21 billion by 2027.AbbVie Inc. PriceAbbVie Inc.

83,a5520cf0-14b5-3cd9-a9cb-6f551f024194,ZTS,2023-06-17,Zoetis’s Wetteny Joseph—one of the few Black CFOs in the Fortune 500—began his journey to finance chief in Haiti,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoetis-wetteny-joseph-one-few-104602199.html,1686912362,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Good morning.“I was learning accounting about the same time I was still learning how to speak English,” Wetteny Joseph, EVP and CFO of Zoetis Inc., a global animal health company, tells me. Although Joseph originally thought he’d become a business lawyer, accounting and finance classes in high school changed his mind. “I felt like it was a strong foundation to really understand a business.”Joseph’s road to becoming a CPA and a Fortune 500 CFO started in Haiti. During his youth, his parents struggled to make ends meet and feed their children, he says. “My father was a carpenter,” Joseph explains. “He was extremely focused. By the crack of dawn, he was already back from a two-hour trip buying materials to make something. My mom was extremely hardworking as well. She was always calm and poised. So, no matter what the circumstance, I'm usually the calmest person in the room.”Joseph came to the U.S. at age 12. “I have nine siblings,” he says. “I left seven of them behind, six of them older than me. And I think maybe those initial years accelerated some level of maturity for me.”Joseph joined Zoetis (the former animal health business of Pfizer Inc.) as CFO in June 2021. The company, led by CEO Kristin C. Peck, landed at No. 463 on this year’s Fortune 500 list, bringing in $8 billion in revenue in 2022, up 4% from a year ago. Zoetis has a portfolio of vaccines and medicines and other technologies used to keep farm animals and pets healthy. The company develops, manufactures, and distributes veterinary products in over 100 countries.Wetteny Joseph, EVP and CFO of Zoetis Inc.‘It’s almost like I'm seeing myself on stage’Before joining Zoetis, Joseph was SVP and CFO of Catalent for three years, having spent a total of 13 years in executive positions at the pharmaceutical, biologics, and consumer health products provider. Before that, he was CFO of the plumbing and HVAC business unit of HD Supply. He also served as corporate controller for Hughes Supply, which was acquired by Home Depot and became part of HD Supply.Story continuesExecutive search firm Crist Kolder and Associates found that there were just 18 companies out of 679 Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 companies with Black CFOs in 2022, a slight decrease from 20 in 2021. The low representation of Black leaders at big corporations is “not just in finance,” Joseph says. “You can look at those stats in a number of different industries. That's unfortunate. I think in any field, where a group is underrepresented, it's going to have one challenge—you don't look up in the organization and see people who look like you.”“I still get a real positive impact from being in the audience and seeing a Ken Chenault [former CEO and chairman of American Express], or Dick Parsons [former chairman of Citigroup and the former chairman and CEO of Time Warner], or any other former Black CEO or senior executive,” Joseph says. “And it's almost like I'm seeing myself on stage.” Joseph is a member of the Executive Leadership Council, an organization for Black C-suite leaders and other senior executives, with the goal of building a global business leadership pipeline of Black talent.‘You’ve got to take the role’In Joseph’s career, sponsors—""The people who would be pounding the table when I wasn't in the room, saying, ‘Give him a shot at this’”—were critical, he says. One such sponsor was the late David Bearman, a former CFO of Hughes Supply, Cardinal Health, and NCR Corporation. “I wouldn't be a CFO here today if it wasn't for him,” Joseph says. About 20 years ago, Bearman promoted Joseph to controller, which was his first time in the role.“I pretty much tried to talk him out of it,” he quips. “David said to me, ‘Look, I'm a great judge of talent, and I've actually never been wrong, so you’ve got to take the role.’”As Joseph’s career progressed, what prepared him for his first CFO role? He made a deliberate move from controller to being the VP of finance for a business unit, he says. “I made it known to the CFO I was working for that this was something I wanted.”With his finance team at Zoetis, Joseph emphasizes learning the business and its customers, he says.""I speak to my team about really understanding 'the outside-in,' meaning—what is the state of the customer?"" Joseph explains. ""What are the things that they're still wrestling with? Then we can have a more fruitful and impactful conversation on how that information feeds into the shaping of our strategy. Then, we’re stewards of the execution of that strategy to bring it to reality.”And Joseph works with a calm determination to make it happen.The next CFO Daily will be in your inbox on Tuesday as Fortune offices are closed on Monday for the Juneteenth holiday.

The company’s primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages.However, the cost of sales continues to increase, hurting the firm’s bottom line. Also, high leverage may limit its financial flexibility. The firm has mostly been paying a lower dividend yield than the industry’s composite stocks over the past two years.(You can read the full research report on Linde here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of S&amp;P Global have outperformed the Zacks Business - Information Services industry over the past year (+26.1% vs. +15.4%).

Buyouts help innovate, increase differentiated content and develop new products.Effective management execution has helped it generate solid cash flow which is utilized for growth initiatives. Dividend payments and share buybacks boost investors confidence and positively impact earnings per share.However, S&amp;P Global remains vulnerable to proceedings, investigations and inquiries with respect to the ratings provided, leading to legal charges, damages or fines.

She was incredibly passionate about creating a scalable solution to support small business owners, and together with her co-founder Carolyn Rodz, they built Hello Alice to bring equitable access to capital to aspiring entrepreneurs.And on the outskirts of Mexico City, store owner Magdalena Padilla Medina learned the ropes of digital payments from a mentor she calls her ""angel.""

Once the order is granted, the changes are expected to deliver greater flexibility in the Foundation’s long-term investment and operational strategy to support its philanthropic mission.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230616204081/en/Mastercard and its then shareholders created the independent foundation in 2006 through a gift of company stock as part of its initial public offering. The performance of Mastercard’s stock over the past 17 years has led to the Mastercard Foundation developing into one of the largest charitable foundations globally with assets of approximately US$37 billion.Since the Foundation’s formation, its stockholdings in Mastercard have served as its sole source of funding. The original Deed of Gift restricts the Foundation from selling its shares of Mastercard except as required to meet the Canadian disbursement quota and related operational needs until May 1, 2027. At that point, the Foundation is permitted to diversify its holdings and scale charitable programming spending, provided it does so in a structured and orderly way so as not to unreasonably disrupt the market for Mastercard stock. Today’s filing seeks permission to commence the diversification process on January 1, 2024, and is part of the Foundation’s operational growth and investment strategy.""The creation of an independent Foundation through a significant gift of stock was an unprecedented act of generosity of Mastercard and its shareholders. The growth of the value of the Mastercard stock has enabled the Foundation to pursue its mission and create lasting impact. We believe a diversified portfolio sets us on the path to further expand our work and impact, investing in the people and programs necessary to deliver on our mission — a world where everyone has the opportunity to learn and prosper,"" said Reeta Roy, President and CEO of the Mastercard Foundation.Story continuesThe Foundation has consulted with Mastercard on the diversification of its endowment if its application is successful. The Foundation maintains confidence in the strength of the Mastercard stock and will retain its name and branding, reinforcing the shared values with Mastercard of doing well by doing good and promoting financial inclusion. In addition, the Foundation and Mastercard have entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Intention and Understanding (MOI) to document the Foundation’s commitment to an orderly sell-down and the ongoing belief in the strength of the stock. The Foundation currently plans to sell the Mastercard stock over seven years and retain a significant overweight holding of Mastercard in its portfolio. The relevant excerpts from the MOI are provided in the enclosed Appendix.""The Foundation and its ability to thrive for the long-term is a lasting legacy of our company,"" said Tim Murphy, Chief Administrative Officer of Mastercard. ""Even as we have operated independently, our respective work has helped to expand financial inclusion and inclusive growth around the world. We believe the steps outlined in the filing provide for an orderly diversification of the Foundation’s holdings and look forward to a continued relationship with the Foundation team for years to come.""About the Mastercard FoundationThe Mastercard Foundation is a Canadian Foundation and one of the world's largest foundations, with a mission to advance education and financial inclusion. It works with visionary organizations to enable young people in Africa and in Indigenous communities in Canada to access dignified and fulfilling work. The Foundation was established in 2006 through the generosity of Mastercard when it became a public company. The Foundation is an independent organization.

When used in this press release, the words ""believe"", ""expect"", ""could"", ""may"", ""would"", ""will"", ""trend"" and similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, include, but are not limited to, whether the parties obtain court approval in a timely manner and the market impact of the Mastercard Foundation’s diversification of its shares of Mastercard common stock, as well as additional factors detailed in Mastercard’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and Mastercard undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release or to conform such statements to actual results or changes in the company’s expectations.AppendixThe following excerpts are taken from the Non-Binding Memorandum of Intention and Understanding (MOI) entered into between Mastercard Foundation and Mastercard Incorporated on June 15, 2023. The MOI confirms that, with the exception of certain provisions (including section 4, quoted below), the MOI does not constitute an enforceable agreement between the parties, but is a non-binding statement of the present intention and understanding of the parties based on their consultations to date.NB: The ""Unlimited Alienation Period"" referenced in the excerpts below is a defined term in the Deed of Gift between the Mastercard Foundation and Mastercard. It refers to the period beginning on May 1, 2027, and continuing indefinitely thereafter, when the Foundation is permitted to diversify its endowment. The Foundation has applied to vary its Deed of Gift so that the Unlimited Alienation Period begins on January 1, 2024.""4. Adherence to Requirements in Deed of Gift. In carrying out the sale of Mastercard shares, the Foundation confirms its commitment to adhere to the requirements in Section 5.01(c) of the Deed, which provides that all sales of Mastercard shares during the Unlimited Alienation Period shall be conducted in an orderly and structured manner so as not to unreasonably disrupt the market for Mastercard shares. Section 5 of this MOI reflects the plan approved by the Foundation to implement the orderly sell-down of the Mastercard shares and the Foundation’s commitment to do so in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt the market for Mastercard’s shares.The parties acknowledge and agree, consistent with the Deed, that nothing in this MOI shall prevent the Foundation’s directors from performing their fiduciary duties with respect to the Mastercard shares, which requires them to act in the best interests of the Foundation and its charitable purposes.5. Plan for Sales of Mastercard Shares. Conditional upon the granting of the said Order and after the new commencement date of the Unlimited Alienation Period, the Foundation has approved the following plan with respect to the ordered and structured sales of the Mastercard shares:(a) The Foundation will proceed with the sell-down of the Mastercard shares into the public market to diversify its investment portfolio over a seven-year period, ending when the Foundation notifies Mastercard that it has reached the target investment described in paragraph 5(b) (the ""Sell-down Period"").(b) The Foundation intends to maintain a target investment in Mastercard shares that represents approximately 10% of the Foundation’s investment portfolio (which portfolio shall consist of the Mastercard shares plus other investments in the diversified portfolio including the Perpetual Endowment Fund) at the end of the Sell-down Period. This target is approximate, and the Foundation’s investment in Mastercard shares may fluctuate following the Sell-down Period.(c) The Foundation will sell between 13-15% of its initial Mastercard shares (i.e., the total Mastercard shares held by the Foundation at the beginning of the Unlimited Alienation Period) annually during the Sell-down Period.(d) The Foundation will limit daily sales of Mastercard shares to not more than 5% of the average daily trading volume for the previous two weeks.(e) The parameters in paragraphs 5(a), (b), (c) and (d) are subject at all times to prevailing market conditions, applicable securities laws, and the Foundation’s fiduciary duties. This may result in periodic adjustments to aspects of the plan above over the course of the Sell-down Period.""6. Mastercard Acknowledgement and Agreement: Mastercard acknowledges and agrees with the Foundation’s intended actions …to seek the Order allowing earlier diversification, on the basis of the Foundation’s expressed commitment and intentions as set forth in Sections 4 and 5 of this MOI. Mastercard will provide its written consent to the [application to vary the Deed].""View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230616204081/en/ContactsMastercard Foundation Media Relations: Wariko Kabuga-Waitawwaita@mastercardfdn.org +1 416-992-9089Mastercard Investor Relations: Devin Corr or Jud Staniarinvestor.relations@mastercard.com +1 914-249-4565Mastercard Media Relations: Seth EisenSeth.Eisen@mastercard.com +1 914-249-3153]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most profitable tech companies in the world.The tech industry may be one of the biggest industries in the world, but 2022 was a disastrous year, with the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index, an index which tracks tech companies in the country, down over 35% as opposed to a 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500. While tech companies saw share prices jump astronomically during the Covid-19 pandemic and also post recovery, resulting in many major tech companies going on hiring sprees. However, 2022 was a year full of uncertainty, resulting in the worst first half in more than half a century for stocks in the U.S., as economic uncertainty and inflation resulted in increasing pressure on earnings and stock performance, while higher interest rates to battle rising inflation only increased the strain on stock returns. War between Russia and Ukraine simply added to a tumultuous year, all of which combined to see 2022 become the first year in which the NASDAQ, on which several of the most profitable tech companies in the world are listed, drop in value in four quarters.Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) alone lost around tw0-thirds of its entire value, a lot of it predicated on the belief that the metaverse is failing, which is not good news for some of the biggest metaverse companies in the world. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), another major tech company, though surprisingly not among the most profitable tech companies, had losses in the trailing twelve months. IPOs have also declined as companies which have had IPOs recently haven't performed too well in the stock market, as opposed to the most profitable tech companies in the world.Top 20 Most Profitable Tech Companies in the WorldPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashAll of this has led to tens of thousands of job cuts across major and minor tech companies, with almost all major companies significantly reducing headcount, reversing hiring sprees carried out at the height of the pandemic. However, that doesn't mean that it's all doom and gloom for tech investors. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has branched into AI, purportedly the next big thing in tech, has seen its stock price jump over 170% in just 2023, and breached the trillion dollar mark in the same year. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) saw its stock price increase by a more modest but still significantly healthy 37% while Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock price jumped by nearly 45%.Story continuesOne of the reasons behind this recent increase in tech stock prices is the AI craze, which may have been going on for a few years, but has reached the next level towards the end of 2022, driven by the release and success of ChatGPT and the hope of less aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed. NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) brilliant earnings report cemented its position as the global AI leader while other tech companies are also making significant investments in the artificial intelligence sector. According to Victoria Greene, the Chief Investment Officer in G Squared Private Wealth ""“Being concentrated in these mega-cap tech stocks has been where to be in this market. You cannot deny the potential in AI, you cannot deny the earnings prowess that these companies have.” Meanwhile, the CFO of  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stated in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call ""Record revenue of 4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 14% year on year on strong growth of our accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets. Let me give you some color across our three major customer categories: Cloud service providers or CSPs, consumer internet companies, and enterprises.""While there is some concern that artificial intelligence is growing too quickly and poses a threat to humanity, as outlined in a letter written by industry leaders, including Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who are considered the ""godfathers"" of artificial intelligence. All of this goes to show that investors who have suffered in 2022 are now seeing returns on their investment in 2023, and this increase in profits is likely to continue in at least the immediate future. Right now, the top four performing companies in the S&amp;P 500 index are all tech companies, including some of the most profitable tech companies in the world, which has led to the Nasdaq increase 25% overall in YTD 2023, far outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index which has returned 9.5% YTD and the Dow Jones Index, which has returned -0.2% in the same time period.MethodologyTo determine our list of the most profitable global technology companies, we first consulted the Fortune Global 500 list and highlighted the top 30 companies with the highest profits. We then checked the latest trailing-twelve-month (TTM) profit from continuing operations for each company from Yahoo Finance, to exclude any one-offs which don't truly reflect a company's operations or profits.

Radars constitute a vital part of their defense equipment.Of late, the demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold, driven by factors like an increase in defense spending of emerging economies, and a rise in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft. The escalated demand has been benefiting radar manufacturing companies like Raytheon in the form of contract wins, like the latest one.In March 2023, Raytheon was selected by the U.S. Navy to be the lead systems integrator for the improved maritime enhancements to the ROTHR, which will provide long-range detection to prevent drugs from entering the United States.

(DFH). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, PulteGroup has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Dream Finders Homes Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PHM is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PHM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.95, while DFH has a forward P/E of 14.08. We also note that PHM has a PEG ratio of 0.50. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. DFH currently has a PEG ratio of 1.16.Another notable valuation metric for PHM is its P/B ratio of 1.78. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, DFH has a P/B of 3.28.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PHM's Value grade of B and DFH's Value grade of C.PHM sticks out from DFH in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PHM is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PulteGroup (PHM).PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.57, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.57 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 71.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PulteGroup, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PHM Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1% over the past month to $9.30.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +5.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 6.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.46 per share, indicating a change of -9.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -13.9%. This estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.16 indicates a change of -1.5% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.92 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.1 billion and $15.52 billion estimates indicate -7% and +2.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $1.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.42%. The EPS surprise was +32.02%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With inflation numbers cooling, the central bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its policy meeting, putting an end to a string of 10 consecutive rate hikes over the past year.This, together with a slew of positive economic data, has meant that the S&amp;P 500 has lately been on a rally. In fact, the benchmark is up about 15% so far in 2023, with the U.S. economy and job market having demonstrated greater resilience than expected.At the same time, the Fed surprised many by suggesting that they could raise rates by another 50 basis points by the end of this year. In other words, inflation is indeed easing, but slowly and is far from over. Amid the muddle of contradictions, market participants are finding it difficult to size up prospects for the rest of 2023.To play this situation, investors who want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through.

IDCC: The company is a pioneer in advanced mobile technologies that enables wireless communications and capabilities. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wilmington, DE-based IDCC indicates 61.9% year-over-year earnings per share growth.

98,c909144f-bacf-3066-9087-e0151d22fac0,JNJ,2023-06-17,"INSIGHT-For groups fighting U.S. opioid crisis, settlement money can be hard to come by",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insight-groups-fighting-u-opioid-110000454.html,1686999600,STORY,['JNJ'],"[By Brendan Pierson and Disha RaychaudhuriJune 17 (Reuters) - Companies accused of fueling the U.S. opioid crisis have so far paid out more than $3 billion to compensate states, but has any of the money reached the people who need it? It depends where you live. Yes, if you’re in Massachusetts; no, in Texas.A series of landmark settlements since 2021 with top drug distributors, pharmacies and drugmakers including Johnson &amp; Johnson set compensation at a total of more than $50 billion nationwide.More than 900,000 people have died of drug overdoses in the United States since 1999, with opioids playing an outsized role, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. State and local officials have touted the settlements as providing desperately needed relief to communities hit hard by the crisis.But when the money will be paid out, and who will get it, remains far from clear, Reuters has found. And many of those who have been working with opioid addiction for years, through a patchwork of non-profit treatment and aid organizations around the country, say they are still in the dark about how, and whether, their work will benefit, according to a series of interviews over the last several months.Reuters reached out to all 50 states and the District of Columbia to ask whether they had a process for non-governmental organizations to apply for funding from the settlements. It also looked for information available online about funding applications.Reuters received responses, or was able to locate information online, for 40 states and the District of Columbia. Of those, the news agency could only confirm that 16 had central, state-wide, publicly available processes for organizations to apply for funding.Some of the remaining states, including Maryland and Illinois, said they planned to open an application process soon. Others offered no specific details about future plans. Arkansas has adopted a unique model; although the state does not have a funding application process, two thirds of its settlement money is going to a partnership of state and local governments, which does have such a process.Story continuesAmong the states where money is already reaching organizations on the ground are Massachusetts, Kentucky and Arizona.“The need to get this money out the door and start making a dent in the crisis has never been greater,” said Brandon Marshall, a professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health who serves as an advisor to the committee overseeing Rhode Island’s settlement. “I don’t quite understand why some states and jurisdictions are taking so long to even create a process.” (Rhode Island is disbursing settlement funds through a rolling series of application processes targeted at specific kinds of interventions.)In Massachusetts, which according to data from the state has received more than $129 million as of this month, funds have already begun flowing, some through a public grant application process.According to a public summary released after a December meeting of the advisory council overseeing the state’s settlement, the state has allocated $3.4 million toward purchasing the overdose reversal drug naloxone, $1.2 million toward methadone treatment programs and $5 million toward organizations that provide long-term housing to people struggling with addiction. The state has also pledged $15 million to repay student loans for health care workers who deal with addiction treatment, and continues to evaluate additional grant applications.“I think Massachusetts is doing an outstanding job,” said Julie Burns, CEO of RIZE Massachusetts, a non-profit that funds efforts to combat the opioid epidemic “Their process has been very open.” (RIZE itself has not received settlement funding.)The fate of Texas's share, more than $270 million received to date beginning in December 2021, is less clear. The state legislature this year appropriated about $22 million for government agencies for 2024 and 2025, and has posted an online form for organizations to register as potential funding recipients.But the state said it does not expect to open up grant applications until later this year or early next year.""Texas spends funds wisely, not quickly,"" Chris Bryan, a spokesperson for the office of Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Glenn Hegar, said in an email, adding that the state was seeking to avoid fraud and abuse of the money. He also noted that the state legislature, which only meets every other year, was not in session in 2022, pushing decisions on spending into this year.Lisa Ruzicka, a coordinator at Kansas-based addiction recovery non-profit Valley Hope Foundation, said that tracks her experience. While Valley Hope, which operates in seven states, has successfully obtained a grant from Arizona and been in touch with other states, it “has been really hard to figure out” how Texas’s grant process works, Ruzicka said.“I’ve had a call in to the Texas attorney general for some time, and you just can’t get anybody to give you answers,” she said. The attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment.DIFFERENT STATES, DIFFERENT STRUCTURESThe opioid settlements stem from thousands of lawsuits brought by state and local governments around the country, beginning in 2017, against drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies - the largest such mass litigation on behalf of the public since states sued tobacco giants in the 1990s.Most of the settlements were nationwide agreements, though some state and local governments opted out and struck their own separate deals. The settling companies include the three largest U.S. drug wholesalers, drugmakers Johnson &amp; Johnson and pharmacy operators Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.Most states share a significant portion of their total settlement funds with their city and county governments, which make their own independent decisions about how to spend.The lack of clarity, so far, about how the money will be spent is reflected in the experiences of more than a dozen advocates and workers dealing with opioid addiction who spoke to Reuters for this story.North Carolina has been widely praised for its transparency around opioid settlement funds, of which it has so far received more than $93 million, thanks to stringent requirements for local governments, which will receive 85% of the money, to report their spending decisions and an online dashboard where the public can track them. The state’s Department of Health and Human Services has already awarded more than $15 million in grants through a competitive application process.Even there, however, the current state of settlement spending plans is not always clear. Associate director Lauren Kestner of the Charlotte-based Center for Prevention Services, which has been awarded an $800,000 state grant, praised the state’s approach overall but said some counties have yet to reveal much about their plans, and that organizations like hers have had to rely on established relationships with officials for information.“Those of us who have been able to get to the table have had to work” to get there, she said.Tricia Christensen, director of policy at Community Education Group, a regional organization covering Appalachia, also commended states like Massachusetts and North Carolina but said that in others – she named Mississippi and Alabama – addiction treatment workers on the ground have “no idea what’s happening.”A spokesperson for the Alabama Attorney General's office said the state's spending was up to the legislature, and that all of the funds would be used to fight the opioid crisis. Mississippi officials did not respond to Reuters inquiries for this article.Mississippi – uniquely among the states – has pledged fully 70% of its $203 million share of the distributor and J&amp;J settlement to a single recipient, the University of Mississippi Medical Center. It did not respond to a request for comment about how it planned to spend the money.Another crucial part of the story is that settlement funds can be used for so-called harm reduction, such as providing clean syringes and test kits for fentanyl, which has not been allowed for federal government funding in the past. Even some conservative states, where harm reduction has been controversial, are becoming more open to the approach.Harm reduction groups see the settlements as a chance to move from the margins to the mainstream, but in some parts of the country they may face an uphill battle.“For the first time we’re being told, you can do syringe services and you can use this money to do it,” Marc Burrows of Challenges Inc, South Carolina’s only harm reduction organization providing syringes, told Reuters in March.But in May, the board overseeing the state’s opioid settlement denied a joint application by Challenges and a county health department to fund harm reduction efforts, without explaining its decision. The board did not respond to a request for comment.(Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York and Disha Raychaudhuri; editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Claudia Parsons)]"

These studies were evaluating the efficacy of Mersana's lead product candidate, upifitamab rilsodotin (UpRi), in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.The FDA's decision to pause new patient enrollment in phase III UP-NEXT study and phase I UPGRADE-A study followed the company’s submission of an aggregate safety report that evaluated bleeding events in approximately 560 patients who received UpRi.The report indicated that there was a higher number of serious bleeding events compared with the expected background rate of bleeding in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Although most instances of bleeding were categorized as low-grade, the report identified five fatal Grade 5 bleeding events among patients treated so far. The causes of these bleeding events are being investigated.As part of the partial clinical hold, the FDA is expected to request a comprehensive assessment of the safety data associated with UpRi, including the bleeding events.Mersana’s phase II UPLIFT study of UpRi for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer remains untouched. The study finished enrolling patients in October 2022. Patients who were already enrolled in the study can still receive UpRi. The company plans to secure the UPLIFT study information and share its results by early August 2023.The company aims to work with the FDA and address any concerns to lift the partial clinical hold and resume patient enrollment in UP-NEXT and UPGRADE-A.Shares of Mersana have plunged 33.6% year to date compared with the industry’s 7.1% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis partial clinical hold represents a temporary setback for Mersana and its efforts to advance the development of UpRi.In February 2022, Mersana partnered with Janssen Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson JNJ, in a research collaboration and license agreement. The agreement aims to develop and market new ADCs for three types of cancer. It will do so using MRSN’s expertise in ADCs and Janssen's antibodies.Story continuesAs part of the agreement, Janssen made an initial payment of $40.0 million to Mersana. Janssen has the option to choose up to three targets for the treatments. It can also change each target once before a specific deadline.Mersana Therapeutics, Inc.

102,ed82bbae-818c-39a3-8ad5-3088f0e4eddf,JNJ,2023-06-17,AbbVie's (ABBV) Skyrizi Meets Ulcerative Colitis Study Goals,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbvies-abbv-skyrizi-meets-ulcerative-114500160.html,1686915900,STORY,"['ABBV', 'JNJ', 'AMGN', 'NVS']","[AbbVie, Inc. ABBV announced top-line data from the phase III maintenance study, COMMAND, which evaluated its IL-23 drug Skyrizi (risankizumab) in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (“UC”) indication.Data from the COMMAND study showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with Skyrizi (180mg or 360mg, administered subcutaneously) achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 52.40% and 38% of study participants who received the 180mg and 360mg dose of the drug, respectively, achieved clinical remission, compared to 25% of patients enrolled in the control group.Study participants who were administered Skyrizi also achieved endoscopic improvement, histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement and steroid-free remission following 52 weeks of treatment, which were also the study’s key secondary endpoints. The drug’s safety profile was consistent with the data from prior studies in other indications.Currently, Skyrizi is approved by the FDA for three indications, which are plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and Crohn’s disease (“CD”).Shares of AbbVie have declined 15.9% so far this year against the industry’s 0.6% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe COMMAND study enrolled only those patients who had responded to induction treatment with the drug in the phase III INSPIRE study. In March, AbbVie reported top-line data from the INSPIRE study, wherein treatment with an intravenous 1200mg dose of Skyrizi achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 12.The targeted UC market is highly competitive. AbbVie faces stiff competition from Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, which markets its own drug Stelara which utilizes a similar mechanism of action to treat the CD indication.A blockbuster drug, J&amp;J’s Stelara is a human IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist approved by the FDA for treating moderately to severely active UC. The drug is also approved for other indications, including psoriasis, CD and PsA. Evidently, Stelara is one of J&amp;J’s top-line drivers. During first-quarter 2023, J&amp;J recorded revenues worth $2.4 billion from Stelara sales.Story continuesLast month, the FDA approved AbbVie’s blockbuster JAK inhibitor Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active CD who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor blockers. The approval marks the seventh FDA-approved indication for Rinvoq across rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology. Apart from CD, Rinvoq is also approved for rheumatoid arthritis, PsA, UC, ankylosing spondylitis and eczema indications.AbbVie is focused on strengthening its focus on new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, to lessen its dependence on Humira, a major top-line driver for AbbVie, which recently lost exclusivity in the United States. Both Skyrizi and Rinvoq demonstrated differentiated clinical profiles, compared to Humira.Over the years, AbbVie’s Humira sales have been steadily declining due to biosimilars eroding the ex-U.S. sales of the drug. Humira’s international sales are already eroding due to the launch of several direct biosimilar drugs in Europe by other pharma companies, including Amgen AMGN, Novartis’ NVS Sandoz division and Biogen. Companies like Amgen, Novartis and Biogen were the first to start commercializing a Humira-biosimilar in Europe in 2018.In January, Amgen announced the launch of the first Humira biosimilar in the United States. The biosimilar is being marketed by Amgen under the trade name Amjevita. Like Amgen, several other companies like Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim and Pfizer have also received FDA approvals for their own Humira biosimilars, many of which are expected to be launched at various times this year per agreements with AbbVie. In March 2023, Novartis (through its Sandoz division) announced that the FDA had approved its Humira biosimilar, which will be marketed under the trade name Hyrimoz. The Novartis division intends to market the drug in the United States from July 1, 2023.With many new indications coming in the next couple of years, AbbVie expects sales of Skyrizi and Rinvoq to be higher and potentially replace Humira. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are expected to collectively exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira by 2027. Management expects the combined sales (risk-adjusted) of Skyrizi and Rinvoq to be more than $17.5 billion in 2025 and more than $21 billion by 2027.AbbVie Inc. PriceAbbVie Inc.

(""Prometheus"") (NASDAQ: RXDX) acquisition. Prometheus is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck and the common stock of Prometheus will no longer be listed or traded on the Nasdaq Global Market.""The Prometheus acquisition accelerates our growing presence in immunology, augments our diverse pipeline and increases our ability to deliver patient value. This transaction is another example of Merck acting strategically and decisively when science and value align,"" said Robert M. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. ""Prometheus brings us a potential best-in-class candidate that creates an opportunity for us to transform treatment for patients with immune-mediated diseases. We are excited to welcome our Prometheus colleagues to Merck and we look forward to working together, driven by our common purpose of saving and improving lives.""Prometheus’ leading clinical candidate, PRA-023, which will be known as MK-7240, is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A), a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis. It is being developed for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD) and other autoimmune conditions. In December 2022, Prometheus announced positive results for MK-7240 from ARTEMIS-UC, a Phase 2, placebo-controlled study evaluating safety and efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severely active UC and APOLLO-CD, and a Phase 2A, open-label study evaluating safety and efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. The findings were recently presented at the 18th Congress of European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).Story continues""At Merck we have deep expertise in clinical development with a proven record of implementing precision medicine strategies,"" said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories. ""By combining our strengths, Merck and Prometheus are well-positioned to advance MK-7240 and additional pipeline candidates.""Additional Transaction DetailsUnder the terms of the acquisition agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, has acquired all outstanding shares of Prometheus for $200.00 per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $10.8 billion. Merck’s full-year financial outlook provided during the first-quarter earnings call did not account for the then proposed acquisition of Prometheus or any additional significant potential business development transactions.As previously disclosed, because this transaction is being accounted for as an asset acquisition, Merck is recording a charge of approximately $10.3 billion, or approximately $4.00 per share. The impact of this charge will result in a reduction in both second-quarter and full-year 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP results. In addition, this transaction is expected to negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.25 in the first 12 months following the close of the transaction due to investment to advance pipeline assets and cost of financing, approximately half of which will be incurred in the second half of 2023.As a matter of policy, Merck provides updates to its financial outlook once each quarter. When considering Merck’s financial outlook issued on April 27, 2023, investors and analysts should deduct the expenses outlined above. Merck will provide an update to its financial outlook when it reports second-quarter 2023 results on August 1.About Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a term used to collectively describe Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. These conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Prolonged inflammation results in damage to the tissues lining the GI tract. Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are usually characterized by diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss.About MerckMerck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, is unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

An FDA official, Dr. Peter Marks, indicated that the FDA may consider selecting the XBB.1.5 subvariant as the preferred target.The VRCPAC endorsement comes a month after an advisory group to the World Health Organization (“WHO”) recommended the next wave of COVID vaccines to provide protection against the XBB lineages. Earlier this month, the European Medicines Agency also backed WHO’s recommendation. All these agencies observed that though the currently authorized bivalent vaccines provide protection against the XBB lineages, the protection wanes with time.COVID vaccine makers Pfizer PFE/BioNTechBNTX, Moderna MRNA and Novavax NVAX are currently updating their own vaccines to target the XBB lineages. During the VRBPAC meeting, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax presented their pre-clinical findings supporting the use of their own vaccines which target the XBB.1.5 variant. The preclinical data from these manufacturers indicate that a monovalent vaccine is more effective against a bivalent vaccine.While Pfizer/BioNTech expects to make their updated vaccine ready for supply by the end of next month, Moderna stated that it is prepared to supply a new variant-containing vaccine for fall 2023. Novavax, on the other hand, stated that it is currently manufacturing its protein-based monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID vaccine candidate at a commercial scale, which is intended to be in the market during the 2023 fall vaccination campaign. However, it is to be noted that these vaccines are yet to be authorized/approved for use by the FDA.Story continuesIn April, the FDA amended the emergency use authorization (“EUA”) granted to the mRNA-based vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.Following the EUA amendment, the current bivalent vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna would be used for all doses administered to individuals aged six months and older. Subsequently, the monovalent/original vaccines developed by these companies are no longer authorized for use in the United States. This was done with the intent to simplify the COVID immunization schedule for the majority of the country’s population.Novavax’s vaccine is currently authorized for use in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older for use as a primary two-dose regimen. The Novavax vaccine is also authorized for use as a booster dose in adults aged 18 years and older.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The pharma giant is collaborating with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) for COVID-19 vaccines targeting XBB.1.5 strains.In line with these findings, a panel from the World Health Organization recommended in May that vaccine manufacturers focus on developing shots for the XBB.1 strains.Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) also expressed its ability to supply a new vaccine later this year, supporting the WHO's recommendation.Novavax Inc (NASDAQ: NVAX) shared its plans to have a vaccine targeting the XBB.1.5 strain ready for distribution in the fall.In documents released this week, FDA staff reviewers said available evidence suggests this year's shots should target an XBB subvariant.Reuters noted that if XBB.1.5 is chosen as the target for this year's campaign, it will benefit Novavax, as their protein-based vaccine takes longer to manufacture than rival mRNA-based shots.

The recall will address the defect in the rear coil spring that can fall off while the vehicle is moving. The models that are called back include the 2022-2023 Grand Cherokee and the 2021-2023 Grand Cherokee L SUVs.According to a document published by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the company says that the springs may not have been installed properly during production. There is a possibility that springs can detach from the moving vehicle, increasing the chances of a crash and creating a hazard for other drivers.The automaker says that it is aware of 17 warranty claims, two customer assistance reports and two field reports that may have been caused by the problem. So far, there has been no report of a crash or injuries due to the defect as of May 25, 2023. Among the recalled vehicles, most are in North America.Air-suspension SUVs are not part of the recall. The vehicle owners will be notified by letter starting Jul 28, 2023. Dealers will perform an inspection on the spring and replace assemblies if required.Moreover, the automaker is also recalling 80,629 trucks and SUVs due to the risk of engine stalls. Per the NHTSA notice, the models covered in the recall include the 2014-2019 Ram 1500 and the 2014-2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 3.0L diesel engines.The notice states that the crankshaft position sensor tone wheel may delaminate, because of which the engine may lose its ability to synchronize the fuel injector pulses and cam shaft timing, potentially causing an engine stall.Dealers will update the powertrain control module software to maintain vehicle propulsion and the update will be free of charge, said the regulator.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksSTLA currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.General Motors Company (GM) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 15.6%, the stock of this company is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. GM meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 12.7% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for GM is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.33. This indicates that the stock moves 33% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that GM has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped GM earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, GM is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. GM is currently trading at 0.33 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 33 cents for each dollar of sales.So, GM appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to GM, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

134,f224a16c-46fc-3bbd-b4b1-d96ac85281d9,UAL,2023-06-17,20 Best Airlines in the World in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-best-airlines-world-2023-161149819.html,1686931909,STORY,"['ALK', 'JBLU', 'DAL', 'UAL', 'LUV', 'AAL']","[In this article, we discuss the 20 best airlines in the world in 2023. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the airline industry and skip to the top 5 airlines, check out 5 Best Airlines in the World in 2023. We previously reported that according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 2023 is the year that the airline industry will see its net profits doubling to approximately $10 billion, while operating profits surpass $22.4 billion. It is forecasted that more than 4.35 billion passengers will board flights in 2023, which is close to the 2019 levels, when 4.54 billion flew throughout the year. Revenues are also projected to exceed $800 billion this year, which suggests a solid recovery in the airline industry. IATA ascribes this strong performance to China lifting its COVID-zero policies, high cargo revenues despite the volume remaining lower than pre-pandemic levels, and moderating jet fuel prices. A KPMG report suggests that the global airline industry plummeted by $140 billion in 2020, recorded a $42 billion loss in 2021, and the loss for 2022 came in at $6.9 billion. The pandemic had a devastating impact on travel and leisure activities, but the airline industry is set to return to profitability next year. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the number of air passengers in 2022 rose about 47% compared to the prior year, and revenue passenger kilometers climbed by 70% during the same time. ICAO attributed this recovery in the industry to robust international travel. ICAO also noted growth of about 50% in the annual passenger revenues of airlines from 2021 to 2022, while keeping the yield and exchange rates aligned with 2019 levels. Another solid signal of recovery in the airline industry was the growing number of aircraft orders and deliveries by Airbus and Boeing. In 2022, these aircraft manufacturers received 53% more orders and delivered 20% more aircrafts as compared to 2021. The aircraft orders in 2022 surpassed 2019 levels. ICAO Council President Salvatore Sciacchitano commented: Story continues“Assuring the safe, secure, and sustainable recovery of air services will be key to restoring aviation’s ability to act as a catalyst for sustainable development at the local, national and global levels, and will consequently be vital to countries’ recovery from the broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”Don't Miss: Top 20 Most Profitable Airlines in the WorldAnother development in the airline industry is the introduction of electric air taxis. Commercial airlines are looking to invest in electric air taxis, as they will make trips to airports quicker for passengers and will potentially reduce wait times at the airports as a result. For example, CNBC reported that in October 2022, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) invested $60 million in Joby Aviation, Inc. (NYSE:JOBY), a company that manufactures electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), which will operate as air taxis. This investment resulted in a five-year partnership between the companies, where Joby’s eVTOLs will operate solely in Delta’s network. Similarly, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) partnered with Heart Aerospace, a Swedish startup, to get electric aircrafts running by 2030. United Airlines has two prior investments in eVTOLs – one for $15 million with Eve Air Mobility, which will supply 200 aircrafts, and another with Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE:ACHR) worth $10 million for 100 aircrafts. Additionally, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) also invested $25 million in Vertical Aerospace, a UK-based manufacturer of eVTOLs. American Airlines placed an order for 50 aircrafts. Savanthi Syth, the managing director of equity research at Raymond James who covers global airlines and mobility, noted that these agreements between airlines and eVTOL manufacturers are not concrete and depend largely on regulations and the ability of companies to produce them. Syth commented: “We think that you’ll see small amounts of [eVTOL] operations starting in the 2025 timeframe, with certifications hopefully happening in 2024. But for you to see a lot of aircraft flying overhead, it’s probably going to be more likely into the 2030s.”In the constantly evolving airline industry, there are too many options for passengers to choose from. Most individuals prefer airlines with the best safety, reliability, service, and quality ratings to ensure a smooth journey, so they are keen to check airline ratings from best to worst before making a decision. While some of the best airline stocks include Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), in this article we discuss the top 20 airlines in the world. Our Methodology For this article, we selected the top rated airlines by AirlineRatings.com and Skytrax World Airline Awards. As of June 15, 2023, Skytrax Awards had the latest airline ranking data for 2022. So we chose the 2022 data from both sources and came up with an average ranking method for our list. We chose an average ranking method since the criteria that the airlines are assessed on is fairly subjective, and averaging out the scores by these two organizations usually produces a better outcome. AirlineRatings.com and Skytrax World Airline Awards rank airlines based on safety records, on-time performance, comfort and amenities, quality of service, frequent flyer programs and loyalty rewards, international network and routes, environmental and sustainability initiatives, and price competitiveness, among others. 20 Best Airlines in the World in 2023Mikhail Starodubov/Shutterstock.comBest Airlines in the World in 202320.

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the consumer staples industry and just want to take a look at the top five biggest consumer staples companies in the world, then head on over to Top 5 Largest Consumer Staples Companies in the World.Forbes reports that there is a 68.2% possibility that the United States will experience a recession at some point in the upcoming year, according to the New York Fed's recession probability indicator, which is at its highest level in more than four decades. In light of this circumstance, investors would prefer to focus on sectors, such as the consumer staples sector, that are thought to be more stable and recession-proof.The consumer staples sector includes stocks of companies that manufacture essential goods such as food, beverages, household goods, and personal care items that people purchase to sustain their daily life, regardless of the state of the economy or their own financial situation. Furthermore, the companies in the sector usually offer regular dividends to investors because of their consistent capacity to generate profits. Consequently, in times of economic uncertainty, the stocks of these companies are relatively stable investments.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the consumer staples sector significantly outperformed the broad market in 2022 despite high inflation, and the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index gained 0.37% through December 9, 2022, as opposed to a 16.17% drop in the S&amp;P 500.Moreover, this sector also lived up to its reputation during the height of COVID-19 pandemic as a number of major consumer staples companies, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), prospered as a result of consumers stocking up on items like diapers, soaps, toilet paper and sodas amid widespread lockdowns around the globe to limit the spread of coronavirus. On the contrary, we witnessed that earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector were negatively affected as people cut down on non-essential spending such as travel and entertainment. Don’t Miss: 13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy.Story continuesConsumer Staples ETFsIf inflation persists or the US economy enters a recession, investors can still increase their exposure to consumer staples sector in a less risky way by investing in consumer staples ETFs over consumer staples stocks.An exchange-traded fund that invests in consumer staples equities is known as a consumer staples ETF. ETFs are a popular investment option for many reasons. ETFs provide diversity by enabling investors to access several stocks with a single investment rather than having to buy each stock separately. Because their volatility is lower than that of individual stocks, ETFs offer more stability.Some examples of consumer staples ETFs include iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC) among others.Bearing these details in mind, let's look at the consumer staples giants of the world.

Shares have lost about 10.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Target due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Target Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Comps Flat Y/YTarget Corporation came up with first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the bottom line beat the same. Total revenues improved year over year, but earnings declined from the year-ago period. Comparable sales were flat to last year. Target witnessed stellar demand in frequency categories but a pullback in discretionary categories.Following the results, management provided a muted view for the second quarter. However, it maintained the full-year forecast based on the expected benefit from efficiency and cost-containment efforts. Target also cautioned that inventory shrink, mainly due to theft and organized retail crime, is likely to hurt this year’s profitability by more than $500 million.Sales &amp; Earnings PictureTarget reported adjusted earnings of $2.05 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74. However, the bottom line declined from the earnings of $2.19 reported in the year-ago period.The big-box retailer generated total revenues of $25,322 million, which increased 0.6% year over year. However, the metric fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25,338.2 million. We note that sales jumped 0.5% to $24,948 million, while other revenues rose 10.2% to $374 million.Meanwhile, comparable sales for the quarter were flat to last year. The metric reflected comparable store sales growth of 0.7% and a comparable digital sales decline of 3.4%. Traffic jumped 0.9% during the quarter. Strength in Food &amp; Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials offset the ongoing softness in discretionary categories.Story continuesMarginsThe gross margin increased 60 basis points to 26.3%, reflecting the benefits of lower freight costs, retail price increases, lower clearance markdown rates and lower digital fulfillment costs. These were partly offset by higher inventory shrink. Meanwhile, the operating margin shriveled to 5.2% from 5.3% in the year-ago period.Other Financial DetailsTarget ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,321 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $16,010 million and shareholders’ investment of $11,605 million. During the quarter, Target paid out dividends of $497 million.Target did not buy back any shares during the quarter under review. At the end of the quarter, the company had about $9.7 billion remaining under the repurchase program approved in August 2021.OutlookBased on soft first-quarter sales trends, Target envisions second-quarter fiscal 2023 comparable sales to decline in the low single digits. For the quarter, the company expects both GAAP and adjusted earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.70 per share.For fiscal 2023, management continued to expect comparable sales in a wide range, from a low-single-digit decline to a low-single-digit increase. Target expects the operating income to grow more than $1 billion. It expects both GAAP and adjusted earnings between $7.75 and $8.75 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -17.31% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Target has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Target has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

139,d052eaeb-12b1-30d6-acfe-809e7a3c8c25,TGT,2023-06-17,Target (TGT) Hikes Dividend: What Else You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-tgt-hikes-dividend-else-130600167.html,1686920760,STORY,"['TGT', 'TJX', 'WMT']","[Target Corporation TGT has been one of the favorite picks for investors seeking both steady income and growth. This Minneapolis, MN-based company with a strong history of dividend payments provide a hedge against any odd swings in the stock market.This general merchandise retailer once again rewarded investors with a hike in the dividend payout. Target’s board of directors raised the quarterly dividend by 1.9% to $1.10 per share. The new dividend will be paid out on Sep 10, 2023, to its shareholders of record at the close of the business on Aug 16, 2023. Last June, Target hiked its regular quarterly dividend by 20% to $1.08.Backed by sound fundamentals and financial strength, Target has time and again highlighted its commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We note that net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,265 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The current hike marks the 52nd successive year of a dividend increase.We believe that such strategic steps not only drive shareholder value but also raise the market value of the stock. Through these dividend increases, companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip. People looking for regular income from stocks are most likely to choose companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payouts.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMore About the StockTarget has been undertaking several strategic endeavors — new stores, owned brand innovations, national brand partnerships, the expansion of same-day services or the rollout of sortation centers — to drive engagement, traffic and market share gains. These have been contributing to the company’s sales performance. Target witnessed stellar demand in frequency categories, such as Food &amp; Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Management intends to spend approximately $4-$5 billion in fiscal 2023 to continue scaling operations, reaching new customers as it builds capacity and enhances services and supply-chain facilities. To simplify and improve efficiencies across the business, Target has announced an enterprise-wide cost-containment effort. Through the initiative, the company plans to save between $2 billion and $3 billion over the next three years.Target has been directing resources toward expanding digital and omnichannel capabilities. The company has been ramping up its digital solutions and strengthening delivery capabilities to make shopping more seamless. Its services like doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store have been playing a crucial role in serving consumers better.We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have fallen 7.5% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 0.2%. The stock came under pressure following Target’s soft second-quarter comparable sales guidance. Target envisions second-quarter comparable sales to decline in the low single digits. It foresees greater SG&amp;A rate pressure in the second quarter. As a result, the operating margin rate is likely to decline on a sequential basis.Story continues3 Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Kroger KR, The TJX Companies TJX and Walmart WMT.Kroger, a supermarket operator, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(ISRG) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ISRG for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Intuitive Surgical, Inc.'s Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Intuitive Surgical, Inc.'s main business drivers.Headquartered Sunnyvale, CA, Intuitive Surgical Inc designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system, Ion endoluminal system and related instruments and accessories. The da Vinci surgical system is an advanced robot-assisted surgical system. The surgical system comprises a surgeon’s console, patient-side cart, 3-D vision system, da Vinci Skills Simulator and Firefly Fluorescence Imaging.Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology which has provided the company with a solid exposure to Mechatronics, Robotocs and Artificial Intelligence for healthcare. The system provides 3-D High Definition vision, which helps surgeons gain superior visual clarity of target tissue and anatomy.Ion endoluminal system is a flexible, robotic-assisted, catheter-based platform that utilizes instruments and accessories for minimally invasive biopsies in the lung. The system can be used beyond surgery into diagnostic, endoluminal procedures as well.It also manufactures EndoWrist instruments, such as forceps, scissors, electrocautery tools, scalpels, and other surgical tools, which incorporate wrist joints for natural dexterity for various surgical procedures.  Additionally, the company sells various accessories comprising sterile drapes for ensuring sterile field during surgery; and vision products that include replacement 3D stereo endoscopes, camera heads, light guides, and other items that facilitate use of the da Vinci Surgical System, as well as Ion endoluminal system for biopsies.Story continuesThe company operates through three segments: Instruments and Accessories, Systems and Services.2022 Results at a GlanceIntuitive Surgical’s 2022 revenues totaled $6.22 billion, up 9% from 2021.The company’s Instruments &amp; Accessories sales were $3.52 billion (56.5% of net revenues), Systems revenues were $1.68 billion (27%) and Services revenues grossed $1 billion (16.5%).Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $5,928.88, or a gain of 492.89%, as of June 16, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 172.07% and gold's return of 35.32% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for ISRG too.Intuitive Surgical reported encouraging first-quarter results, wherein earnings and revenues beat estimates. The da Vinci procedure volume continued its recovering trend of 2022 into the first quarter of 2023, which is likely to persist for the rest of the year. Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth in 2023. Intuitive Surgical witnessed healthy customer demand for its products in the quarter under review. Its Ion platform has strong growth potential. A stable liquidity position is an added plus. It outperformed its industry over the past six months. However, higher component and labor costs, and a strong U.S. dollar continues to hurt gross margin. Stiff competition in the global MedTech space and rising costs remain concerns for Intuitive Surgical.The stock is up 5.14% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 11 higher, for fiscal 2023.

Macroeconomic factors such as cost inflation, evolving consumer behavior and unfavorable retailer inventory dynamics have been further concerns for the company.Shares of this producer and distributor of lawn and garden products, and pet supplier have lost 6.5% in the past year, compared with the industry’s 8.5% decline. For fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Central Garden &amp; Pet’s sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $3.31 billion and $2.35, respectively. These estimates show corresponding declines of 0.9% and 16.1% from the year-ago period’s figures.Let’s Delve DeeperWe note that the company has been witnessing sluggishness in its Garden segment for a while now. Gardening is generally limited to the period between spring to summer, which makes the garden business highly seasonal in nature. Failure to perform during the season is likely to have a significant impact on the company’s yearly financials.The Garden segment’s net sales decreased 5% year over year to $434 million during second-quarter fiscal 2023. This is driven by lower sales in Grass Seed, Controls &amp; Fertilizer and Live Goods, partly offset by strength in Wild Bird and Packet Seed.Unfavorable spring weather and changes in retailer buying patterns hurt net sales. This followed a decline of 6% in the preceding quarter. The segment’s operating income came in at $50 million, down from the $71 million reported in the prior-year quarter, while the operating margin contracted 400 basis points to 11.4%. Soft sales, input cost inflation and initial start-up costs associated with the recently acquired live goods facility hurt margins.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlso, the company’s Pet segment has been soft for a while now. The segment’s sales came in at $475 million, down 5% from the year-ago period. This followed a decline of an equivalent percentage in the preceding quarter. The metric declined due to the muted demand for durable pet products, the decision to discontinue certain low-profit private-label pet bed product lines and lower sales in Outdoor Cushions. The segment’s operating income came in at $55 million, down from the $61 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the operating margin shrunk 60 basis points to 11.6%. The decline was mainly driven by lower sales.Central Garden &amp; Pet has been witnessing weak margins, and higher selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, gross profit decreased 9.5% to $259.6 million. Also, the gross margin shrunk 150 basis points to 28.6%, following a contraction of 260 basis points in the preceding quarter. The decline was driven by the Garden segment due to unfavorable overhead absorption in key garden businesses and input cost pressures. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses increased 110 basis points to 20%. As a result, the operating margin shriveled 260 basis points to 8.6%.Central Garden &amp; Pet operates in highly-competitive markets and hence faces intense competition from regional and national firms on grounds of price, product quality, number of products offered, brand awareness and customer service.Story continuesConclusionAll the aforesaid negatives make Central Garden &amp; Pet a current Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock now. A VGM Score of D further adds to the weakness.On the positive front, Central Garden &amp; Pet is strengthening its position as one of the leading companies in the U.S. pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies space. Unique packaging, point-of-sale displays, logistic capabilities and a high level of customer service are some of the positives. The company is also making smooth progress on its Central-to-Home strategy. On its last earnings call, management had projected growth in the operating income and EPS during the second half of fiscal 2023.However, we remain cautious about the stock in the near term given the aforesaid weaknesses.Eye These Solid PicksSome better-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, Crocs CROX and lululemon athletica LULU.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

A pandemic, remote work, supply chain issues - it was certainly a challenging year.At Regions Bank, with hundreds of contract or alternate staffing openings, the challenges were complicated by a management system that looked more spreadsheet than digital. 134 spreadsheets, to be exact.Today, those spreadsheets are gone. They've been replaced by a powerful tracking and management software - Beeline - and a strong business collaborator - Pinnacle Group. These have helped improve the efficiency and processes around the company's contingent workforce.The improvements have helped Regions recognize more than $1 million in expense savings. Competition among the company's contingent labor workforce providers has increased, contract staff are better prepared when they begin, and the quality of the workers has vastly improved.But the ""success"" part of this success story isn't simply in the results; it's in how those results were realized. It's a story that shows what can be accomplished when small, diverse businesses have a level playing field to succeed.Making a ""Beeline"" From Manual SpreadsheetsIn business parlance, companies like to refer to ""problems"" as ""opportunities.""But if you asked Antonio Howard, Regions HR Technology Manager, or Julie Jarecki, Regions Procurement Manager, it would be difficult to categorize a system to manage the company's contract and offshore workforce that had almost no automation, no significant usable data and no company-wide reporting as an ""opportunity.""Story continuesWe made a strategic business decision to contract with a technology company - Beeline - to help Regions automate and better manage our offshore and contract workforce. Julie Jarecki, Regions Procurement Manager""We were literally keeping up with our contract worker requisitions, access authorizations, spend and more on spreadsheets,"" Howard said. ""We were also not doing enough to competitively source contract workers. We had a few companies that we typically used, but the whole process was manual.""An opportunity indeed.""We made a strategic business decision to contract with a technology company - Beeline - to help Regions automate and better manage our offshore and contract workforce,"" said Jarecki. ""Beeline could offer us much of what we needed.""Technically, Beeline is a software-as-a-service company. Its expertise is in providing software that helps companies manage non-traditional workforces, such as contract, offshore or similar. They are one of the largest providers of this type of technology.They provide the tool.""But we knew that we needed more than Beeline,"" Howard added. ""It doesn't provide the people or the analysis. It manages the processes, not the soul.""The Opportunities You Don't Know You HaveBeeline helped improve the day-to-day management of Regions' contingent workforce needs, tracking spend more effectively and managing credentialing and onboarding. At the same time, there were some real opportunities:To better manage overall contingent worker expensesTo ensure a greater focus on diversity in contingent workersTo reduce time spent finding and placing contingent workersTo encourage more competition between vendorsEnter Pinnacle Group.""I could talk for hours,"" said Jarecki. ""Pinnacle has helped Regions move from an inefficient, spreadsheet-based methodology for managing our contract workforce to one that helps ensure we are getting the best workers at a fair price, while working toward our goals for diversity.""Here are just a few examples of how Pinnacle Group and Beeline are making an impact:The process and time needed for onboarding contract workers (credentialing, access approval and more) has been reduced, in some cases by up to 40%.Automated systems now alert managers and others about contract worker departures or renewals, and have greatly improved recordkeeping and accuracy around identity and access managementNearly one-quarter of the contingent positions filled in 2022 were filled with diverse workers, up more than 75 percent over the previous year.Helping companies reach those types of goals isn't just something Pinnacle Group did for Regions. It goes back to the company's roots and its purpose.The Pinnacle Group StoryNearly 27 years ago, Nina Vaca was a young entrepreneur with big dreams. She sat on her apartment living room floor and drew up the beginnings of a business plan that would plant the seeds for what is today one of the nation's premier managed service providers (MSPs) and contingent staffing companies, and the largest Latina-owned one.""We focus on intelligent growth,"" Vaca said. ""What that means is we don't do business with just anyone. We've been very focused on picking captains of industry, companies that we can grow with for decades. That's been our strategy. We like to go deep and wide into the companies we serve.""Growing up the daughter of Ecuadorian immigrants, she watched the entrepreneurial spirit in her parents and learned. Her father's key to success was looking for opportunity where others didn't.Two years out of college, she started Pinnacle. 27 years later, Vaca is an advocate and role model for women-owned businesses and the Hispanic community.The walls of Pinnacle Group's Dallas headquarters are lined with awards the company has won and profiles on the company and Vaca, based on the success they've enjoyed with their clients. But the real story on those pages is all about service and ensuring inclusive prosperity for the people they place and the companies they serve.""We're delighted that we get to serve some of the largest companies in the nation, including Regions Bank,"" she said. ""We're so proud to have helped co-author the company's contingent labor program, one of the best in their sector.""Adding Soul to Powerful Technology""The goal at the outset was for visibility into Regions' contractor workforce,"" said Michael Keiper, SVP of Strategic Services at Pinnacle Group. ""What we thrive on are environments that are brand new to build the services and infrastructure our clients need.""Managers and executives now have more access to data and assurance that they are getting qualified workers at a fair price, while also ensuring a level playing field for everyone.""The reporting that is available to us now in Beeline is incredible,"" said Benji Barnett, Regions Financial Manager. ""This is a level of detail for staff augmentation that we have not had access to in the past. It now enables and enhances our ability to manage, analyze and forecast for human capital with precision. In addition, the customer service from Pinnacle is top notch.""Results matter. And we've been able to structure the program in a way that pays for itself - still getting a better product and diverse and talented workers for a fair price. Tiffany Lovelace, head of Supplier Diversity at RegionsAccording to Tiffany Lovelace, head of Supplier Diversity at Regions, Pinnacle Group and Beeline not only paved the way for the program to become more efficient, they also created a pathway to ensure that the teamwork continues.""Results matter,"" Lovelace added. ""And we've been able to structure the program in a way that pays for itself - still getting a better product and diverse and talented workers for a fair price.""""By clearly understanding Regions' goals and pain points, we've been able to partner with them and with Beeline to boost visibility into Regions' diverse supply base, increase the participation of diverse suppliers in the program and create the opportunity for Regions to procure the best, most transformational talent in the market,"" said Vaca.

151,c02f2da2-1639-30f5-8c73-5b0fad85ebd1,RF,2023-06-17,Regions Financial (RF) Aided by Higher Rates Amid Expense Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financial-rf-aided-higher-162900686.html,1686932940,STORY,['RF'],"[Regions Financial Corporation RF is benefiting from a rise in net interest income (NII) supported by higher rates and decent loan growth. Additionally, its buyouts will also aid its growth. However, pressure on mortgage income and a lack of diversification in the loan portfolio are headwinds. Also, rising non-interest expenses are likely to impede bottom-line growth.Regions Financial remains focused on improving its NII. It witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5% over the last three years (2019-2022). The uptrend continued in the first quarter of 2023. Given the company’s asset-sensitive balance sheet, high interest rates are expected to support its NII and net interest margin in the upcoming period.Moreover, the metric will be supported by the company’s strong lending pipeline, which is expected to drive loan growth. Over the past three years (ended 2022), the company’s total loans witnessed a CAGR of 5.2%. The rising trend continued in the first quarter of 2023. Management expects total loans to grow around 4% in 2023.Regions Financial continues to explore opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions, primarily in mortgage servicing rights. In 2021, the company acquired Clearsight, Sabal Capital and EnerBank USA, diversifying its revenue sources. Its commitment to diversifying its revenue streams and meeting customer needs via diverse services is expected to support its long-term growth prospects.As of Mar 31, 2023, Regions Financial had long-term borrowings of $2.31 billion, while its liquidity sources aggregated $53.8 billion. Given a strong liquidity profile and strong credit ratings, the company is less likely to be in default on interest and debt repayments if the economic situation worsens.The robust liquidity position and decent earnings strength are also expected to support Regions Financial’s capital deployment activities. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had repurchased a total of 725,000 shares for $15 million under its $2.5 billion share repurchase plan. Also, in July 2022, the bank announced an 18% increase in its quarterly common stock dividend to 20 cents per share. Such moves enhance shareholder value and boost investor confidence in the stock.However, Regions Financial continues to record an increase in expenses. Non-interest expenses witnessed a CAGR of 5.3% over the 2019-2022 period. The rising trend continued in the first quarter of 2023. Such a trend is likely to continue negatively impacting the bottom line in the near term. Management expects adjusted non-interest expenses to increase 4.5-5.5% in 2023.Regions Financial’s mortgage income witnessed a negative CAGR of 1.5% over the 2019-2022 period. Further, the metric declined in first-quarter 2023. High mortgage rates are likely to continue affecting residential first mortgage loan origination volume and margins in the upcoming period, thereby impeding non-interest income.Moreover, the majority of Regions Financial’s loan portfolio comprises commercial and industrial lending, as well as commercial real estate lending. The current rapidly changing macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates may put some strain on commercial lending. Thus, a lack of loan portfolio diversification is likely to hurt the company’s financials if the economic situation worsens.Currently, Regions Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the past six months, shares of the company have declined 11.1% compared with the 5.7% fall of the industry.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFinance Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are HomeTrust Banshares, Inc.

Vodafone CEO Margherita Della Valle is making big moves as a new CEO, a British baroness is behind California's social media law, and Marissa Mayer is a founder now. The Broadsheet will be off on Monday to observe Juneteenth. Have a great weekend!- CEO to founder. Marissa Mayer has had a storied career in Silicon Valley, from employee No. 20 at Google to Yahoo CEO. But until recently, she'd never held that other lauded Silicon Valley title: founder.Mayer has spent the past few years building what is now Sunshine, an A.I.-powered contacts tool. She joined us at a Fortune Most Powerful Women dinner in Menlo Park, Calif., this week to talk about that career pivot. Even though she hasn't herself been a founder before now, she said, she's spent years surrounded by them.""My whole career has been based around my interactions with great entrepreneurs,"" she told Fortune editor-at-large Michal Lev-Ram. ""I got to witness and work with the best,"" she said, name-checking Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page.Marissa-Mayer-MPW-Palo-Alto-Dinner-2023.B13A3614In her executive roles at Google and Yahoo, she acquired dozens of companies, requiring her to judge what makes a good founder.So when she landed on the idea that felt right for her, addressing a major product and design problem, she was ready to become a founder herself. She's bringing her legendary work ethic—weekly all-nighters during her early time at Google—to a new startup with 25 employees, compared to Google and Yahoo's thousands.Sunshine's platform aims to simplify and learn from people's digital address books. The typical person has 2,000 contacts, 20% of which are usually ""stale"" with a nonfunctioning phone number or email address, Mayer says. Mayer's goal is for Sunshine to learn information like which contacts are friends and which are colleagues, or even who's a colleague who became a friend or a friend who became a colleague. The platform aims to understand which relationships are on the upswing—with increased contact—and which are trailing off. With that information, Sunshine can help people better take advantage of their networks, plan events, and more.Story continuesAs a startup leader, Mayer says she's standing by the management principles that guided her Big Tech executive days. Not all of those were popular, like Yahoo's return-to-office mandate a decade ago. (Sunshine employees also work in the office today.) ""I never ask someone to do something I wouldn't do myself,"" Mayer says. ""And a lot of those values translate regardless of company size.""Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com@_emmahinchliffeThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

AIMCO had 10.6% revenue growth and 14.2% growth in net operating income (NOI). Looking forward, AIMCO sees 5% to 7% additional revenue and NOI growth in 2023. One of its successfully completed goals in the past year was to reduce total leverage, and it has done that by $400 million.Recently AIMCO has been pressured by activist hedge fund Land &amp; Buildings, which owns 6% of AIMCO. Land &amp; Buildings has been critical of AIMCO’s performance and would like to see the REIT explore a potential sale of the company in the $11- to $13-per-share range. From its most recent close of $8.45, that would be a substantial gain.Over the past 52 weeks, AIMCO has had a total return of 44.54%. The annual dividend of $0.08 yields less than 1%.Looking for something more innovative? The rising cost of homeownership is driving up the demand for tiny homes, which is why more than 170,000 people are already on the waitlist for Boxabl's modular tiny house.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 86% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about McKesson. Check out our latest analysis for McKesson ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McKesson?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.McKesson already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McKesson's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McKesson. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 23 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of McKessonThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McKesson Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$63m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over McKesson. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  McKesson is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NYSE:APD). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$297 and falling to the lows of US$267. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Air Products and Chemicals' current trading price of US$291 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Air Products and Chemicals’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals What Is Air Products and Chemicals Worth?Great news for investors – Air Products and Chemicals is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $388.16, but it is currently trading at US$291 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Air Products and Chemicals’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from Air Products and Chemicals?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 64% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Air Products and Chemicals. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since APD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on APD for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy APD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Yahoo Finance entertainment reporter Allie Canal discusses some of the challenges Disney faces going forward.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: But in a surprise executive shakeup, Disney announcing late Thursday that CFO Christine McCarthy is stepping down. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is following the story and joins us now with the details. Hey, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rachelle. That's right. Another bombshell shakeup in the C-suite for Disney and this is a big one. Since Christine McCarthy was at the company for eight years, she's long been looked at as a really loyal confidant for current CEO Bob Iger. The company saying she's taking a family medical leave of absence. In her place will be Kevin Lansbury. He currently serves as Executive Vise President and CFO of Disney Parks Experiences and Products.Now, Lansbury will serve as interim CEO until the company can find a permanent replacement. But McCarthy will be very involved in that process. She will stay on as a strategic advisor and will assist in the process of identifying and onboarding a long-term successor.Now, we did hear earlier this morning from Wells Fargo media analyst Steve [INAUDIBLE]. He wrote in a note to clients that this presents yet another wrinkle for Disney and especially Bob Iger who has been really trying to reshape this company since he took over that CEO role in November. Since that time, we've seen massive cost cuts at the company with 7,000 jobs eliminated. That's part of the broader plan for Disney to slash $5.5 billion worth of costs over the next two years.And this all comes down to profitability. We've seen Iger work really hard to establish new types of revenue streams like Disney's ad supported tier. We've also seen price increases across the board to help pare some of those direct to consumer losses and lift metrics like average revenue per user. But all that being said, we still have a very bumpy road ahead.Story continues[INAUDIBLE] saying that the back half of 2023 will be particularly challenging for Lansbury since we have a softening and parks growth due to inflation. We have a murky timeline for DTC margin improvements. That's one of the bigger stories heading into the back half of 2023.And then we also have that minority stake purchase of Hulu. What are we going to do with ESPN and bringing that over the top? Which is something that a lot of analysts said that Disney should be working towards. And Bob Iger has hinted at that as well.So these are all overarching challenges that any CFO that steps into this position is going to have to face. We'll see who comes out on top in this search. But right now, yet another challenge for Disney, which has been challenged for quite some time.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed, coming into a complex environment that new CFO, whoever they may be. A big thank you there to our very own Allie Canal.]"

McCarthy will stay on the leadership team as a strategic advisor and will assist with the process of identifying and onboarding a long-term successor ""to ensure a smooth and successful transition,"" Disney said.""I look forward to helping with the transition and will always be rooting for the success of my extended Disney family, who have shown time and again that determination, teamwork, and the pursuit of excellence are an unstoppable combination,"" McCarthy said.Christine McCarthy, chief financial officer of The Walt Disney Company, is stepping down from her role, the company announced. (Michael Kovac/Getty Images)Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall said Lansberry will face a slew of uphill battles heading into the back half of 2023, including a softening of parks growth due to inflation, a murky timeline for direct-to-consumer (DTC) margin improvements — the biggest issue, in Cahall's view — in addition to the purchase of Hulu's minority stake and the impact of taking ESPN fully over-the-top.""Separately these are speed bumps to the stock. Together they're obstacles,"" he wrote in a new note to clients on Friday.Disney will report third quarter earnings in August. Cahall anticipates limited long-term guidance and expects both McCarthy and Lansberry to speak on the earnings call.Story continuesOverall, the analyst, who has a $147 price target on the stock, said Disney is an above-average opportunity but also boasts above-average risk compared to Netflix's ""more straightforward story.""""The CFO transition adds yet another wrinkle,"" he said. ""It will be followed by a CEO transition within another 1-2 years, while ESPN and DTC present discrete operational challenges. We think it's an opportunity for this kind of upside on such a large-cap stock, but no doubt it will take time for the pieces to come together.""Disney stock was down about 1% on Friday following the news.Iger, who stepped back into the CEO position in November, has remained hyper-focused on profitability as investors shift focus away from subscriber growth and put more emphasis on margins.The executive has worked to establish new revenue streams like Disney's recently launched ad-supported tier, in addition to various price increases to help pare losses and lift metrics like average revenue per user, or ARPU. He reaffirmed the company's outlook of reaching streaming profitability by 2024.Disney, which has reiterated plans to slash $5.5 billion in costs, including $3 billion in content costs, announced an effort to cut 7,000 jobs in February. Disney went through its first round of layoffs at the end of March. Its second and largest round occurred in late April, with a third round taking place last month.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:UAA), is not the largest company out there, but it saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Under Armour’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Under Armour Is Under Armour Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 37%, trading at US$7.81 compared to my intrinsic value of $5.72. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Under Armour’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Under Armour?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Under Armour, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -4.7%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe UAA is currently trading above its value, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the uncertainty from negative growth in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UAA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. you may want to reconsider buying the stock at this time. The company’s price has climbed passed its true value, in addition to a risky future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management.

With an anticipated investment of about $4.6 billion, the facility is likely to spur local economic development by generating thousands of jobs.A strong talent base, solid infrastructure set up and healthy business environment tilted the scales in favor of Poland as the preferred choice for the new semiconductor facility. It is likely to work in unison with its existing wafer fabrication facility in Leixlip, Ireland and its planned wafer fabrication facility in Magdeburg, Germany, to help create a first-of-its-kind end-to-end leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing value chain in Europe.The facility, set to be built per green building principles to minimize carbon footprint, will receive silicon wafers from wafer fabrication facilities. It will then cut them into individual chips, assemble them into final products and test them for performance and quality before shipping them to customers. It will also assemble individual chips into final products and will likely serve as a catalyst for additional investments and innovation in Poland and across the European Union to further develop the semiconductor ecosystem.Intel has been lately facing dwindling overall sales largely due to PC inventory correction and contraction in the server market. Revenues declined significantly in first-quarter 2023 owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment, uncertain business conditions and softening demand trends. Softness in the end consumer and educational market demand is likely to remain an overhang on the company’s performance.Consequently, top management has embarked on a massive investment roadmap by developing new manufacturing hubs and improving its operating technology to bring the company back to its growth trajectory.Intel is betting big on the IoT business and is investing heavily to gain a higher market presence. While the focus was earlier on making the best computing chips and generating industry-leading margins from them, the company now prefers to focus on a product range targeting different market segments. Management believes that although the higher-end businesses in more developed economies continue to look up, the new strategy should help it get into many more device categories, where Intel products will likely continue to enjoy a premium based on performance.The stock has lost 3.1% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 95.8%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksInterDigital, Inc.

The $5.4 billion, all-stock merger is set to create one of the nation’s biggest providers of drilling and fracking services targeting shale plays. Should the merger be completed by the end of this year, the combined entity will have a significant presence in the Permian Basin.This provider of onshore contract drilling services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +800%. Revenues are expected to be $782.19 million, up 25.7% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Patterson-UTI, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

In light of this circumstance, investors would prefer to focus on sectors, such as the consumer staples sector, that are thought to be more stable and recession-proof.The consumer staples sector includes stocks of companies that manufacture essential goods such as food, beverages, household goods, and personal care items that people purchase to sustain their daily life, regardless of the state of the economy or their own financial situation. Furthermore, the companies in the sector usually offer regular dividends to investors because of their consistent capacity to generate profits. Consequently, in times of economic uncertainty, the stocks of these companies are relatively stable investments.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the consumer staples sector significantly outperformed the broad market in 2022 despite high inflation, and the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index gained 0.37% through December 9, 2022, as opposed to a 16.17% drop in the S&amp;P 500.Moreover, this sector also lived up to its reputation during the height of COVID-19 pandemic as a number of major consumer staples companies, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), prospered as a result of consumers stocking up on items like diapers, soaps, toilet paper and sodas amid widespread lockdowns around the globe to limit the spread of coronavirus. On the contrary, we witnessed that earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector were negatively affected as people cut down on non-essential spending such as travel and entertainment.

ETFs are a popular investment option for many reasons. ETFs provide diversity by enabling investors to access several stocks with a single investment rather than having to buy each stock separately. Because their volatility is lower than that of individual stocks, ETFs offer more stability.Some examples of consumer staples ETFs include iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC) among others.Bearing these details in mind, let's look at the consumer staples giants of the world.

More recently, billionaires, lawmakers, and large swaths of the public have fretted about it for real.But Aidan Gomez, cofounder and CEO of Cohere—a red-hot A.I. startup recently backed by database giant Oracle and chipmaker Nvidia—thinks such fears are overblown. Worse, they’re distracting us from “real risks with this technology,” he said in a Financial Times interview published Thursday.Oracle said this week it will use Cohere’s technology to let its business customers build their own generative A.I. apps. Cohere is in some ways to Oracle what OpenAI is to Microsoft, with each startup receiving hefty investments from their Big Tech partners who in turn use their A.I. technology. The difference is that Cohere is designed for corporate customers that want to train A.I. models on their own data without sharing it, whereas OpenAI has tapped more readily available information to train its buzzy A.I. chatbots ChatGPT and GPT-4.Gomez, previously a researcher at Google Brain, one Google’s A.I. arms, sharply criticized the open letter signed in March by tech luminaries—including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak—that called for a six-month pause on development of A.I. systems more advanced than GPT-4 to give policymakers a chance to catch up. Aside from it being “not plausibly implementable,” Gomez told the FT, the letter talked “about a superintelligent artificial general intelligence (AGI) emerging that can take over,” a scenario he considers exceptionally improbable.(The letter asking for the pause reads in part, “Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?”)“To spend all of our time debating whether our species is going to go extinct because of a takeover by a superintelligent AGI is an absurd use of our time and the public’s mindspace,” Gomez argued.Story continuesReal A.I. risksInstead, he said, “there are real risks” that need to be addressed today. One immediate concern is that “we can now flood social media with accounts that are truly indistinguishable from a human, so extremely scalable bot farms can pump out a particular narrative.”Asked about the danger of such capabilities undermining democratic processes—with the U.S. presidential election looming—he replied:“Things get normalized just by exposure, exposure, exposure, exposure. So, if you have the ability to just pump people the same idea again and again and again, and you show them a reality in which it looks like there’s consensus—it looks like everyone agrees X, Y and Z—then I think you shape that person and what they feel and believe, and their own opinions. Because we’re herd animals.”To address the problem, he said, we need mitigation strategies such as human verification, so we “can filter our feeds to only include the legitimate human beings who are participating in the conversation.”He credits Musk for the blue-check revamp at Twitter, despite its rough start and surrounding controversy. Under Musk, the marks previously given to notable figures for free are now given to anyone for a monthly subscription, with Musk describing it in late March as the “only realistic way to address advanced A.I. bot swarms taking over.”“You can complain about the price or whatever—maybe it should be free if you upload your driver’s license, or something,” said Gomez. But “it’s really important that we have some degree of human verification on all our major social media.”Another pressing risk, he said, is with people trusting A.I. chatbots for medical advice. ChatGPT and its ilk are known to “hallucinate,” or basically make things up, which can be problematic when your health is on the line. Gomez didn’t offer specific ways to address the danger, but warned: “We shouldn’t have reckless deployment of end-to-end medical advice coming from a bot without a doctor’s oversight.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.Story continuesBefore taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.Safra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, Q4 was another fantastic quarter and the end of a great year. But before I get to the numbers, I'd like to go over our journey to get here. Three years ago, I shared with you that our own business transformation had reached a crossover point as our fast growing businesses had eclipsed the size of our declining businesses. And as a result, this would inevitably drive revenue growth acceleration going forward. Now, I don't blame you for not believing me at the time. Fiscal year 2020 growth was zero. Well, as you can see, this has played out with organic revenue growth accelerating significantly. And that's despite the closure of our nearly half a billion dollar Russia business.Since fiscal year 2020, our strategic back office SaaS business has more than doubled in size. And consumption of our Gen 2 cloud infrastructure service is now seven times larger. And while competitors have seen their growth rates drop precipitously over the last year, our cloud infrastructure growth rate has essentially doubled from last year to 77% this quarter and with Gen 2 OCI growth even higher. And we're far from done. In fact, I just told my team, I think we're at about the middle of the beginning. Looking ahead, I see even more growth opportunities that should help power future growth acceleration in the future. We remain committed to the fiscal year 2026 targets that we shared with you last fall at our financial analyst meeting. And our exploding AI demand leaves us significant upside.Our momentum has been driven by two fundamental differences from our competition. One, highly differentiated technology. And two, a much better customer experience. Firstly, our cloud applications are very popular with a growing base of customers in part because we are the most modern, comprehensive, and innovative set of apps across back office, CX, and industry applications. We implemented AI machine learning capabilities years before anyone was talking about it. And it helps our customers run their businesses every day. To complete the picture, we can serve customers of any size around the world from small businesses on NetSuite to global enterprise on Fusion in all industries. Having the best cloud application technology has helped us grow the business to $11 billion in SaaS revenue while expanding gross margins.On the infrastructure side, we're seeing more and more media articles reporting on the unique capabilities of OCI and our database technologies. Larry will explain our unique differentiation in a moment. But the result is that customers are choosing to run on Oracle infrastructure for all their requirements, be they new services like AI training or services we're known for, like database and Java. To complement the technology, we've changed our culture such that we are totally focused on our customers' success. That partnership spirit starts with engineering as we work hand-in-hand with companies as they try out our technology and continues all the way through their success with us. There's no question that this close partnership with our customers has led to our success.As part of that, we've also created an organization called Customer Success Services, or CSS. This group ensures that customers get the most value from their Oracle purchases, from planning to activation to implementation to support to anything else they need to succeed. We think this unique approach, which customers already tell us they love, ultimately drives overall customer satisfaction, and that results in higher renewal rates, expansion rates, and referencing. Now, I'll turn to Q4. As always, I'll discuss financials using constant currency growth rates, and also provide a full picture. I'm going to share with you results, including and some excluding Cerner, so that you have it all. Total cloud revenues, SaaS plus IaaS, was $4.4 billion, up 55%, with IaaS revenue of $1.4 billion, up 77%, and SaaS revenue of $3 billion, up 47%.Excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS, was up more than 33%, at $3.8 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.4 billion, up 25%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include product support, were $4.4 billion, up 37%. Application-specific revenues, including support, but excluding Cerner, were $3.4 billion, up 11%. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.4 billion, was up 17%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.6 billion, and grew 24%, including Fusion ERP, up 28%, and NetSuite ERP, up 24%. Together, our strategic back office businesses are now larger and have grown faster than our local competitor for four straight years.Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $5 billion, up 15%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 77%, excluding legacy hosting services. Infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 89%, with an annualized revenue of $5.2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 112%. Cloud at customer consumption revenue was up 60%, and autonomous database was up 47%. Database subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 6%, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 41%. As on-premise databases migrate to the cloud and cloud at customer, we expect these cloud database services will be a third leg of revenue growth and revenue growth acceleration, alongside back office SaaS and Gen2 OCI cloud services.software, tehnology, computerPhoto by Hack Capital on UnsplashSoftware license revenues were $2.2 billion, down 14%, following the 25% growth we saw a year ago in Q4. So, all-in total revenues for the quarter, including Cerner's revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, were $13.8 billion, up 18%. Shifting to margins, the gross margin percentage for cloud services and license support was 78%, as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenues, with its mid-90s gross margins, represented about 62% of cloud services and license support revenue, and now it's down to 53%. But this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support, even as license support continues to grow. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 19% with Cerner, 10% excluding Cerner in Q4.Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. While we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 44% as we continued to integrate Cerner. As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 9.2%, and the non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 in U.S. dollars, up 8% in USD, 10% in constant currency.The GAAP EPS was $1.19. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $50 billion, up 22%. And excluding revenue, total revenue grew 7%. Total application subscriptions were 35%, and 10%, excluding Cerner, compared to 8% last year. And total infrastructure grew 10%, compared with 5% growth last year. Clearly, our revenue growth continued to accelerate again this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue was $35.3 billion, up 21%. Total cloud services by itself were up 50%, to $15.9 billion. And excluding Cerner, total cloud services were up 29%, to $13.6 billion. And with revenue growth acceleration in both strategic back office cloud applications, which were up 27% for the year, and cloud infrastructure services, which were up 63% for the year.Non-GAAP EPS was $5.12 in USD, up 4% in USD, and up 10% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 42%. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. And the short-term deferred revenue balance was $9 billion, up 9%. Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 42%, at $5.6 billion. While free cash flow was up 46%, at $3.7 billion. Now over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17.2 billion, up 80% from last year, as we're now seeing cash flow benefits from our cloud transformation. With capital expenditures of $8.7 billion this year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up from $5 billion last year. And I expect that we will see very good results in our fiscal 24 free cash flow.The remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance, is $67.9 billion, up 47% in constant currency, due to strong cloud bookings as well as Cerner. I would also note that organic RPO was 15% in constant currency, as a result of our customers burning through their commitments at a heightened rate. I expect that you'll see this number run up as customers reload and new customers sign up. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.9 billion in Q4 and $8.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs. Our investment strategy for adding capacity remains to build many, many identical cloud regions. Our starting point is smaller, which allows us to go where competitors cannot.And this continues to be an advantage for us. Given the demand we have and see in our pipeline, I've increased our CapEx projection and I now expect the fiscal 2024 will be similar to this year's CapEx. I also expect our Gen 2 OCI business will have another excellent year of revenue growth as existing centers fill up and new centers come online. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud. We now have 42 public cloud regions around the world with another 7 being built. 12 of these public regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We have many, many clouded customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions, and 9 more planned.And lastly, we have 9 national security regions live with immense demand for more. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This year, this fiscal year, we repurchased 17 million shares for a total of $1.3 billion. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.7 billion over the last 12 months as the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now to guidance. And as I've said before, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. Let me turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis like everything else. If currency exchange rates remain as they are now, currency should have a 0 to 1% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.01 positive effect on EPS in Q1.However, actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 7% to 9% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 8% to 10% in USD at today's exchange rate. Additional upside depends on how fast we can put out even more capacity to our customers. Total cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, is expected to grow from 28% to 30% in constant currency and 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% to 12% and be between $1.11 and $1.15 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% to 13% and be between $1.12 and $1.16 in USD. My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19.5. However, as you see nearly every quarter, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary.Now, before I finish, let me also give you some initial thoughts on fiscal year 2024. As I described, and Larry will elaborate in depth, we are seeing unprecedented demand for our cloud services and especially our AI services. As a result, I expect cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, will continue growing at at least similar rates to what we experienced in fiscal 2023, even though our base is much bigger and may be higher. As our high-growth cloud revenues are becoming a larger, larger portion of total revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of our total revenue growth. I expect this trend will continue in fiscal 2024. And of course, we also expect to deliver a higher non-GAAP operating margin percentage this coming year as well. Okay. Before I hand off to Larry, I want to take a moment to thank our customers for making fiscal year 2023 such an enormous success.You've been wonderful partners, and we thank you for your trust in us. And I want to thank our employees for being focused on advancing our customers' missions so spectacularly. Some of you are new, and many of you have been with us for years, in fact, even decades. And I think you all see that our best days are, in fact, ahead of us. Thank you for your loyalty and for your incredibly hard work. And thank you, Larry, our CTO, our Chairman, and our founder for leading with brilliance, determination, and vision, and allowing us to all be part of this incredible journey, which is just getting started. So thanks, Larry. And with that, I'll turn it over to you for your comments.Larry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. The hardware and software in Oracle's Gen2 Cloud is fundamentally different than other hyperscalers' clouds. The CPUs and GPUs we rent to customers are interconnected using an ultra-high-performance RDMA network, plus a dedicated set of cloud-controlled computers that manage security and data privacy. Oracle's unique set of hardware and software building blocks enable our Gen2 Cloud to deliver much higher performance than any of our cloud competitors. And in the cloud, since you pay by the minute, if you run twice as fast, and we do, you pay half as much. What is especially interesting in today's world is that all of Oracle's cloud data centers have a high-bandwidth, low-latency RDMA network that is perfectly optimized for building the large-scale GPU clusters that are used to train generative large-language models.NVIDIA themselves are doing AI development in the Oracle Gen2 Cloud. And we are partnering with NVIDIA to build the world's largest high-performance computer, an AI computer, with 16,000 GPUs. The extreme high performance and related cost savings of running generative AI workloads in our Gen2 Cloud has made Oracle the number one choice among cutting-edge AI development companies, including Mosaic ML, Adept AI, Fouhear [Ph], Modal Labs, Character, HyperReal, SliceX, Vector Space Bio, Falconry, Respeacher, Altair, InfoWorld, 12 Labs, Layton Space, plus many, many others. In the aggregate, our generative AI cloud customers have recently signed contracts to purchase more than $2 billion of capacity in Oracle's Gen2 Cloud. One last thing. In partnership with Cohere Oracle is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers.This new service protects the privacy of our enterprise customers' training data, enabling those customers to safely use their own private data to train their own private specialized large language models. Oracle's application development teams were early adopters of this new AI cloud service. We used our own private data to improve and extend the training of existing Cohere large language models. This supplementary training resulted in two new specialized large language models, one for medical professionals and one for first responders. Specialized large language models will be instrumental in helping highly trained professionals use their precious time more efficiently. As I said, Cohere and Oracle are working together to make it very, very easy for enterprise customers to train their own specialized large language models while protecting the privacy of their training data.Over the next few years, lots of companies are going to train their own specialized large language models. Our partner, Cohere, is also using the Oracle Gen2 Cloud for training their own large language models. In health care alone, specialized large language models will speed the discovery of new life-saving drugs, improve the quality of patient care, and increase access to health care by lowering costs. A technology revolution is dawning. Back to you, Safra.Safra Catz: I think we're going to take some questions. Ken?Ken Bond: Yes, thank you, Safra. Thank you, Larry.

Micron’s revenue with businesses based in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors, accounts for about a quarter of Micron’s global revenue and remains the principal exposure, the company said.“Micron is working to mitigate this impact over time and expects increased quarter-to-quarter revenue variability,” the company said in the filing.Micron, the largest US memory chipmaker, fell 1.5% in New York Friday morning.The technology sector has become a key battleground over national security between the two largest economies. US lawmakers have decried Beijing’s moves against Micron as a thinly veiled attack on an American company, at a time Washington itself is imposing sanctions on China. The US has blacklisted Chinese tech firms, cut off the flow of sophisticated processors and banned China’s citizens from providing certain help to the domestic chip industry.In May, China’s cybersecurity regulator said Micron’s products failed to pass a review and barred the company’s chips from “critical infrastructure.” Beijing warned operators of key infrastructure against buying the company’s goods, saying it found “relatively serious” cybersecurity risks in Micron products sold in the country.Story continuesMicron has said previously that it stands by the security of its products and commitments to customers.The ban on Micron’s chips exacerbated the uncertainty dogging US chipmakers that sell to China, the world’s biggest market for semiconductors. Companies like Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Intel Corp. deliver billions of dollars’ worth of chips to the country, which imports more semiconductors than oil.Despite the restrictions, the Boise, Idaho-based company on Friday announced it would be plowing another $600 million into an existing packaging facility in central China. The company will acquire equipment and add assembly lines at its existing facility in the central city of Xi’an over coming years, it announced in a post on Chinese social media platform WeChat.Washington is seeking to strengthen key supply chains outside of China as it works to contain Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions. The US is pushing to build advanced chipmaking domestically and in friendly countries as growing global tensions spur concerns about the world’s reliance on Asian centers, such as Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory.Intel announced on Friday a new $4.6 billion chip facility in Poland and Micron is close to an agreement to commit at least $1 billion toward setting up a semiconductor packaging factory in India, people familiar with the matter said.(Updates with detail on probe and investment in packaging facility.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFinal Fantasy XVI Shows Off Square Enix’s Skill at ReinventionNissan Takes the Long, Costly Road to Reusing EV BatteriesWhat the Reddit Revolt Means for Social Media in an AI EraHow Many People Does It Take for the Government to Send a Text?It’s Brutal to Get to the Ocean’s Depths.

YUM is benefiting from the robust performance of Taco Bell, Habit Burger, KFC and Pizza Hut segments. Though all four segments are witnessing robust growth, Taco Bell and Habit Burger are likely to be the major growth drivers in 2023.The company is benefiting from robust digital initiatives through mobile and online platforms across all brand segments and same-store sales growth. Also, its focus on unit-expansion efforts bodes well. In the past three months, the stock has gained 9.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 10.2%.Our model predicts, YUM’s revenues and earnings in 2023 to witness growth of 6.4% and 8.1%, respectively, year over year.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversOur model predicts, the Taco Bell segment’s revenues in 2023 to grow 6.7% year over year. During first-quarter 2023, segmental revenues were $572 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter's levels. The upside was primarily backed by same-store sales growth (12%) and unit growth (6%).The Taco Bell segment is benefiting from solid demand with respect to craveable product offerings including Crispy Melt Taco and Grilled Cheese Burrito. It also initiated delivery service through its mobile app boosting customer access to craveable products.Per our model, Habit Burger’s 2023 revenues are likely to rise 13.8% year over year. The segment is benefiting from expansion efforts. In first-quarter 2023, Habit Burger opened 11 gross new restaurants in the United States and Cambodia.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company aims to revamp its financial profile. This, in turn, will improve the efficiency of its organization and cost structure globally. It believes that a “slimmer Yum Brands” would lead to efficiency gains.Considering its existing footprint of 55,361 restaurants worldwide, YUM! Brands believes that it can roughly triple its current global presence over the long term. Its efforts to consolidate franchisees in Latin America and the Caribbean are likely to drive growth. During the first quarter of 2023, YUM opened 746 gross new units, including nearly 271 gross new units of Pizza Hut and 385 gross new units of KFC.Despite the challenging environment, the company impressed investors with robust same-store sales growth in first-quarter 2023. It reported consolidated same-store sales (excluding China) growth of 8% year over year. A rise in dine-in traffic, digital initiatives and strategic third-party partnerships resulted in the upside. During the quarter, same-store sales at Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut rose 8%, 9% and 7% year over year, respectively.The company has been benefiting from a recovery in emerging markets. Given the emphasis on consumer value proposition, expanded digital access and franchise partners, YUM anticipates the momentum to continue in the upcoming periods.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcernsAn increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance, and other operating costs such as rent and energy costs put significant pressure on Yum! Brands’ margins. A competitive retail environment weighed on the restaurants’ costs. It is susceptible to profit margin pressure due to relentless expansion.In first-quarter 2023, net costs and expenses amounted to $1,122 million compared with $1,038 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The transfer of business and exit from Russia incorporated certain additional costs which hurt margins.

Of those three years, only 43 weeks are within our control, the rest is outside of it.”Developers across the company have complained of long delays in gaining planning approval, with house builders in particular sounding the alarm over long waits.The problem has been blamed on new tighter environmental regulations and a lack of skilled staff at local councils.Alistair Macrow - Paul GroverCllr Darren Rodwell, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: “Councils have lost a number of experienced planning officers in recent years as a result of increased workloads, particularly since the pandemic and salaries that struggle to compete with the private sector.”Mr Macrow’s frustration comes as McDonald’s undertakes a significant investment campaign in Britain. The fast food chain is planning to invest around £280 million in the UK over the next four years aimed at making its restaurants more efficient.Plans include the addition of features such as separate waiting rooms for delivery drivers and “smart” scales in kitchens that can tell if items have been left out of a bagged order.The investment comes as McDonald’s battles to keep costs down during the worst inflation crisis in 40 years. Last year, the chain was forced to raise the price of a cheeseburger for the first time in 14 years, putting it up from 99p to £1.19.Mr Macrow, who has been at the company since 2007, said: “Back in my days as UK marketing director, I was really excited about launching our saver menu – January 2, 2009, I still remember the date. We launched the Mayo Chicken, that was our new ‘hero product’, 99p. It was still 99p at the start of this year... we’ve had to move that now to £1.19.”Story continuesPrices of some items on the menu have risen for the first time in some cases as the cost of everything from energy, to wages, to potatoes has surged.He refused to rule out further price rises but argued that the chain still represents good value compared to rivals. It is hoped that investment in cost-saving technologies will also help keep price rises to a minimum.“Inflation is inflation. We can’t change that,” he said. “We’re sitting here and you can have a hot burger, fries and a drink served to your table for £3.99. I don’t know too many [businesses] able to do a better job.”As well as battling inflation, the company is fighting to restore its corporate image after a high-profile sex scandal.Global chief executive Steve Easterbrook was sacked in 2019 after admitting an “inappropriate” but consensual affair with an employee.Mr Easterbrook was handed a generous exit package worth tens of millions of dollars, but McDonald’s subsequently sued him to recover the award after it discovered evidence of other, undisclosed sexual relationships with staff members.The company now faces a lawsuit in the US from aggrieved shareholders who have accused Mr Easterbrook and other senior management of fostering a “party atmosphere” that contributed to the scandal.In the UK, the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) said in 2019 it was aware of 1,000 instances of harassment against McDonald’s staff.McDonald’s says this figure “was not substantiated, and no evidence presented to us relating to this volume of cases at the time”.Mr Macrow, who was promoted to run the UK and Ireland business in 2021, said the company has “a strong culture of people who enjoy being together”.In reference to Mr Easterbrook, he said: “You shouldn’t take what has proven to be the behaviour of an individual to represent the company.“The culture of the company has always been very, very strong. Yeah, there’s an individual situation, which has been widely publicised and has been dealt with exactly the way it should do.“It’s been dealt with that way because values are the most important thing in our business and it’s putting that straight.”Steve Easterbrook - Hannelore Foerster/Getty ImagesHe stresses the company has “doubled down” on safeguarding, including signing a legally-binding agreement with the Equality &amp; Human Rights Commission earlier this year to protect staff from sexual harassment.Mr Macrow, who has also worked at Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams, said: “We are absolutely committed to making sure there’s no place for any sort of harassment.”He revealed that McDonald’s – like several other companies – cancelled its membership of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) when the lobbying group was engulfed in a sexual misconduct scandal earlier this year.Besides its culture, Mr Macrow must also continue to work on changing the perception of McDonald’s as unhealthy food.The chain has struggled to shake-off the association with bad diets and poor health ever since the documentary Super Size Me was released almost 20 years ago.In 2019, then-Labour deputy leader Tom Watson branded one of its ad campaigns “a danger to public health” for a Monopoly-themed marketing promotion which offered desserts and other items as prizes.Obesity has only become a greater issue since the pandemic and NHS England last week announced it would open 10 more specialist obesity clinics for children after a surge in the numbers of overweight young people.53 year-old Mr Macrow, who was McDonald’s’ global marketing chief during the pandemic, admits that “obesity is an issue in this country” but argues that his company is doing its bit to help address the problem.He said McDonald’s has removed thousands of tonnes of fat, salt and sugar from its menu over the last few years.“We started with the Happy Meal,” he said. “We basically tackled things like nuggets, and fries from a salt, fat and sugar point of view. We’ve significantly reduced the amount of salt on our fries.”Mr Macrow does not agree that much of McDonald’s’ food should be lumped in with ultra-processed foods (UPF), a classification that has recently caught the public’s attention because of its negative impact on health.He said: “You go to our beef plant in Yorkshire and watch whole cuts of beef come in the back door. They go into a mincer to get folded into a patty and get frozen. That’s it. And then after we cook them, we add salt and pepper.“I’m sure there’ll be people out there who think that’s Ultra Processed Food. To me that is fresh beef served in a really good way.“I’m not sure how many people realise that every Egg McMuffin comes from somebody cracking an egg and one of our kitchens and putting it and putting it onto the grill.”McDonald’s sells a vegan burger called the McPlant in the UK despite the fact it was dropped in the US business after a trial last year. It comes amid a wider slowdown in demand for vegan alternatives, which boomed in popularity during the pandemic.Mr Macrow believes vegan dining is here to stay but says many went “too far too fast” with their expansions.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Additionally, each of these stocks have high Zacks Ranks, suggesting strong near-term expectations for their stocks.McDonald’sMcDonald’s is a leading fast-food chain that currently operates more than 39,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The company mainly operates and franchises quick-service restaurants (QSRs) under the McDonald’s brand.Nearly 93% of the company’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local businesspeople. MCD’s revenues include sales by company-operated restaurants but primarily come in the form of franchise fees from the independently managed restaurants.Earnings have grown at a very stable and impressive rate from just $1.40 per share in 1999 to $10.45 per share today. That’s a CAGR of 8%. Because of its business model, MCD essentially charges rent to its restaurant owners and collects a franchise fee. This has been a very successful and enduring strategy.McDonald's currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 4% and are expected to grow 8% YoY. FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 5% and are projected to grow 9.3% YoY.Story continuesAdobeAdobe is one of the largest software companies in the world collecting licensing fees from customers, which form the bulk of its revenue. ADBE also offers technical support and education, which accounts for the balance.Not only have ADBE earnings grown steadily, but they have accelerated considerably in the last decade, forming the always desirable hockey stick chart. Adobe’s EPS have compounded at a ridiculous 14.4% annually over the last 25 years and its stock has appreciated over 9,000% over that period.Adobe currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. EPS is expected to grow 13.3% annually over the 3-5 years, in line with its long-term average, which is remarkable considering how large a company it is today.ADBE is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 39x, which is just above the industry average of 33x, and a bit above its 25-year median of 34x.PepsiCoPepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies. Its complementary brands include Frito-Lay snacks, Pepsi-Cola beverages, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices and Quaker foods. The company serves customers in more than 200 countries and territories.Earnings growth in PEP is about the smoothest up trending line in finance that I have seen. Over the last 25 years annual EPS have grown from $1.21 per share to $7.00 per share, which is a CAGR of 7.3%.Additionally, over the last 20 years, PEP has reduced its share count by 20% through persistent share buyback programs. This has further ensured upward movement in the stock.Making PepsiCo an even more compelling investment is its generous dividend, which yields 2.8%. Pepsi has increased its dividend every single year for the last 50 years, making it one of the very prestigious dividend king stocks. Over the last five years the dividend has been increased by 5.4% annually.Procter and GambleProcter &amp; Gamble is a multinational consumer goods behemoth that has established itself as a global leader in its industry. With a rich history spanning over 180 years, PG has built a reputation for delivering high-quality products and brands that are household names worldwide. The company operates across multiple categories, including beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric and home care, and baby care, with a diverse portfolio of well-known brands such as Gillette, Pampers, Crest, and Tide, among others.With a consistently growing portfolio of household products, as well as top-notch execution over decades, PG has built an impressive record of growing earnings.Procter and Gamble currently earns a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings are projected to grow 9% YoY, while sales are projected to grow 2.3% over the same period. FY23 earnings are expected to increase just 1% YoY, however FY24 is expected to resume growth, with estimates of an 8.3% YoY increase.If consistently growing earnings wasn’t enough to guarantee stock appreciation PG also has the strong tendency to return huge amounts of cash to shareholders. Though stock buybacks management has decreased share count by 17% over the last 15 years.Furthermore, the company offers a dividend yield of 2.6%, which it has increased by an average of 6.3% annually over the last five years. Procter and Gamble has paid a dividend for 132 years and has increased the dividend payment consecutively for 66 years.Bottom LineInvesting in stocks with a long-term trend of growing earnings per share can be a prudent strategy for investors seeking sustainable growth in their portfolios. By identifying companies that consistently improve their earnings over time, investors can potentially benefit from the compounding effect and capitalize on the long-term value creation.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of GARP investment and the performance of these stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends. If there is one thing the market has taught investors this past year, it is the importance of diversifying portfolios to reduce risk. Choosing stocks in different economic conditions has consistently posed challenges for investors because what works in one market may not work in another. For example, growth and value equities have exhibited varied performances over different time periods and market conditions, making them equally popular among investors. So, combining the elements of both strategies can offer investors a much-needed way out from traditional investment plans. This is where the GARP strategy comes in. Growth at a Reasonable Price, or GARP, is a relatively lesser-known investment approach that seeks to identify companies with sustainable earnings growth and attractive valuations relative to their growth prospects. These companies may operate in industries or sectors with favorable growth trends or possess competitive advantages that can drive their future growth.Popularized by Peter Lynch, the GARP strategy’s main goal is to avoid the extremes of either growth or value investing, which leads investors to growth-oriented stocks with relatively low price-to-earnings ratios in normal market conditions. If successfully identified, these stocks have the potential to generate positive returns for shareholders. Historically, the S&amp;P 500 GARP Index has delivered higher returns than its underlying benchmark. The index tracks the performance of companies with consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuation, and strong earnings power. Some of the best GARP stocks in the index are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).  In the past 12 months, the index gained 12.7%.Story continuesAccording to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 GARP delivered an annual average return of 13.2% from June 1995 to June 2019, compared with a 9.81% growth of the S&amp;P 500. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index and the S&amp;P 500 Enhanced Value Index returned 10.41% and 11.83%, respectively. The report also mentioned that the GARP Index’s risk-adjusted returns during the above-mentioned period were higher than growth and value indices.Also read: 12 Best Fast Growth Stocks to Buy NowCPI’s latest report shows that consumer prices rose 4% this May, down from 4.9% in April. This cooling inflation also signals a pause in interest rate hikes, giving investors room to take a breather from the longest streak of increases. However, this does not imply that the stock market is out of the perils as investors still need meticulous investment plans. BMO Capital’s chief strategist Brian Belski advised Canadian investors to follow the GARP strategy this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) remains one of our key style preferences for Canadian equities in 2023. Furthermore, earnings growth and revision trends are broadly consistent with the S&amp;P 500, suggesting there are likely many opportunities developing in Canada to implement a growth at a reasonable price strategy.”CNBC report also highlighted remarks of BMO’s analysts about the possible investment strategies to navigate the market uncertainties in the US. The report mentioned that investors should use GARP and dividend growth approaches in the current financial environment. Dividend stocks have proved their mettle in previous inflationary periods, becoming popular among investors.

UPS is a global parcel shipment and logistics company which competes in a global oligopoly with high barriers to entry. UPS’ integrated network is more efficient than its closest peer, as evidenced by its margin profile, free cash flow conversion, and returns on invested capital. The company’s management team is focusing on profitable growth through its Better, not Bigger strategy which should improve margins and future opportunities for the company. The stock price was down due to market concerns about customer concentration and Amazon’s potential entry into the parcel delivery and logistics market.

216,0cf022df-465b-35f7-97eb-fe9ffd5201c4,UPS,2023-06-17,"United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-ups-trending-130007809.html,1686920407,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned +4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has gained 6.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share, indicating a change of -22.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.78 points to a change of -16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.41 indicates a change of +5.8% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UPS is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of UPS, the consensus sales estimate of $22.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -7.4%. The $96.45 billion and $99.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3.9% and +2.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $22.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $2.20 for the same period compares with $3.05 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.94 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.05%. The EPS surprise was +0.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He described the pressure in the Nordics as ""challenging,"" and that he was ""deeply saddened by what's happening"" to its brands there. Marabou is popular in Sweden, and Freia is Norwegian.""It is hard for all of us to see our company singled out and treated differently from other peers despite the realities of the situation,"" Gruber said in the memo, which was distributed internally at Mondelez. ""If you look in most kitchen cupboards, you will see many products from food and beverage companies that have not exited Russia."" Gruber didn't refer to any specific brands.""If there were boycotts on all brands that have parent companies with activity in Russia, there would be a food supply issue,"" Gruber said, without specifying any brands.The boycotts, initiated by companies including airline SAS, began last week in Sweden and Norway. The backlash stemmed from Ukraine's National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption naming Mondelez an ""international sponsor of war"" last month for continuing to sell its goods in Russia. Mondelez did not comment on the designation.It is not entirely uncommon for companies to boycott another company. For example, hundreds stopped advertising on Facebook, now Meta, in 2020 after U.S. civil rights groups enlisted multinationals to pressure the company into taking concrete steps to block hate speech.Story continuesAfter boycotts of Mondelez's Freia and Marabou chocolate brands in the Nordic region this week the company said on Thursday that it was working to make its business in Russia stand-alone with a ""self-sufficient supply chain"" before the end of the year. The company did not supply details on its plans for Russia. Food does not fall under any international sanctions.As Putin's war enters its second year, companies that continue to operate in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine have drawn criticism from human rights groups, customers, employees and investors, according to numerous media accounts.A representative at the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mondelez did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the memo. Mondelez rivals in chocolate including Nestle still operate in Russia as do many other consumer products companies. Nestle said in its latest annual report that it had six factories in Russia including confectionary. Nestle didn't respond to requests for comment.Mondelez pledged March 9, after the invasion, it was ""scaling back"" non-essential activities in the country and focusing on ""basic offerings."" On Thursday, Mondelez said it has ""scaled down our activities, discontinuing new capital investment, new product launches and our advertising media spending in Russia.""But it has continued business in Russia and boosted shipments of some of its products to the country, customs data covering from January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2023 shows.Shipments to Russia of products with descriptions that specifically mention Milka chocolate bars rose 131% to 22.4 million kilograms in the year after the war, starting in April 2022 through the end of March, from 9.7 million kilograms in the prior 12 months, according to records Reuters obtained from a commercial provider of customs data.Shipments of all Mondelez products to Russia jumped to 45 million kilograms from 28.7 million kilograms in the same time periods, according to the data.A Mondelez spokeswoman, contacted multiple times, did not comment on the customs data.In a statement, Mondelez said that since January, the company's overall volumes in Russia have ""declined double digits,"" and both its import volumes and market share have significantly decreased.The company did not provide further details on the figures. It also said it does not disclose country-level sales, import and export data.Mondelez also said Thursday it was continuing to reduce its activities in Russia and expects further volume and sales declines.So far, Mondelez's Russian business has been more profitable in recent months than in the past because the company suspended advertising in the country, a cost savings, and increased prices, according to an April filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) covering the first three months of 2023. Currency changes also helped the business, the quarterly SEC filing shows.Jan Kæraa Rasmussen, head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability at Mondelez investor PensionDanmark, said the Danish pension fund considers the ""downscaling of their business in Russia a progression.""We see potential for further steps from the company,"" Rasmussen said. ""We are skeptical about the need for most companies to be present in Russia and encourage them to reconsider their operations in the country.""(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Additional reporting by Maurice Tamman and Terje Solsvik; Editing by Anna Driver)]"

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the consumer staples industry and just want to take a look at the top five biggest consumer staples companies in the world, then head on over to Top 5 Largest Consumer Staples Companies in the World.Forbes reports that there is a 68.2% possibility that the United States will experience a recession at some point in the upcoming year, according to the New York Fed's recession probability indicator, which is at its highest level in more than four decades. In light of this circumstance, investors would prefer to focus on sectors, such as the consumer staples sector, that are thought to be more stable and recession-proof.The consumer staples sector includes stocks of companies that manufacture essential goods such as food, beverages, household goods, and personal care items that people purchase to sustain their daily life, regardless of the state of the economy or their own financial situation. Furthermore, the companies in the sector usually offer regular dividends to investors because of their consistent capacity to generate profits. Consequently, in times of economic uncertainty, the stocks of these companies are relatively stable investments.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the consumer staples sector significantly outperformed the broad market in 2022 despite high inflation, and the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index gained 0.37% through December 9, 2022, as opposed to a 16.17% drop in the S&amp;P 500.Moreover, this sector also lived up to its reputation during the height of COVID-19 pandemic as a number of major consumer staples companies, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), prospered as a result of consumers stocking up on items like diapers, soaps, toilet paper and sodas amid widespread lockdowns around the globe to limit the spread of coronavirus. On the contrary, we witnessed that earnings of companies in the consumer discretionary sector were negatively affected as people cut down on non-essential spending such as travel and entertainment.

ETFs are a popular investment option for many reasons. ETFs provide diversity by enabling investors to access several stocks with a single investment rather than having to buy each stock separately. Because their volatility is lower than that of individual stocks, ETFs offer more stability.Some examples of consumer staples ETFs include iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC) among others.Bearing these details in mind, let's look at the consumer staples giants of the world.

224,7f9b632b-cc13-370f-9170-3bbef35179f3,BSX,2023-06-17,Surmodics' (SRDX) Receipt of New FDA Nod to Boost Patient Care,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surmodics-srdx-receipt-fda-nod-152000551.html,1686928800,STORY,"['SRDX', 'HOLX', 'BSX']","[Surmodics, Inc. SRDX announced its receipt of the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its Pounce LP (Low Profile) Thrombectomy System. The system, which is the latest addition to its Pounce platform, is indicated for use in vessels ranging from 2 mm to 4 mm in diameter, which are typical sizes of vessels found below the knee.Surmodics expects to initiate limited market evaluation (LME) for the Pounce LP Thrombectomy System by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company is planning the commercialization following the completion of the LME.The latest regulatory clearance is expected to boost Surmodics’ vascular intervention medical devices business under the broader Medical Device segment and solidify its foothold in the niche space.Significance of the ApprovalThe Pounce Thrombectomy System was introduced in 2021 and was intended for the non-surgical removal of thrombi (a blood clot that forms in a vein) and emboli (anything that moves through the blood vessels until it reaches a vessel that is too small to let it pass) from the peripheral arterial vasculature in vessels of 3.5 mm to 6 mm in diameter. The Pounce LP Thrombectomy System is expected to allow efficient clot removal in below-the-knee peripheral arteries. This will likely expand the addressable market for the Pounce platform.Per management, the latest FDA approval is expected to extend the range of treatment for the Pounce platform to include the removal of organized thrombotic or embolic occlusions in smaller vessels below the knee. Catheter-directed thrombolysis in these vessels is limited against organized clots and requires ICU admission, while small-diameter aspiration thrombectomy devices may struggle to remove organized material in the distal lower extremity.Following the FDA’s clearance, the treatment range of the Pounce platform is likely to be expanded to address tibial clots, an important component of treatment in this vulnerable patient population. This, in turn, is likely to boost patient outcomes.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global thrombectomy devices market was valued at $1.3 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $2.6 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 7.4%. Factors like the increase in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and growth in demand for minimally invasive procedures are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance raises optimism about Surmodics.Notable DevelopmentIn April, Surmodics reported its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it witnessed a solid uptick in the overall top line. The company registered robust revenues in its Medical Device segment as well as in its Product sales, and Research, development and other revenues. During the quarter, Surmodics saw strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.The same month, Surmodics announced the enrollment of the first patient in PROWL, the Pounce Thrombectomy System Retrospective Registry. PROWL is an open-label, retrospective, multi-center U.S. registry of the Surmodics Pounce system for the non-surgical removal of emboli and thrombi in the peripheral arterial vasculature.Also, in April, Surmodics announced the first usage of the company’s Sublime radial access microcatheter. The Sublime microcatheter is currently in limited market evaluation. The full suite of Sublime microcatheters will be launched in fiscal 2024.Price PerformanceShares of Surmodics have lost 29.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 19.8% decline.

(Photo: Shutterstock/Paullawat)Colonial Terminals has acquired 16.7 acres of land along the Savannah River in Georgia so it can develop breakbulk infrastructure along Norfolk Southern’s rail network.The land is currently adjacent to an existing Colonial Terminal riverfront facility as well as an NS (NYSE: NSC) facility.Colonial Terminals is a division of the Colonial Group. Both are based in Savannah.Breakbulk is freight cargo that can’t fit into standard-sized shipping containers, so the cargo is broken apart and loaded and unloaded individually.Colonial Terminal said the new facility and infrastructure “should allow in excess of a million tons of throughput and support the development of a new wide-span berth expected to move steel, paper, and other forest products, but capable of handling any general breakbulk cargo.”The project will take place in two stages: Phase one will involve the construction of a berth and refurbishment of an existing warehouse facility, while phase two will consist of a new rail-served warehouse or outside storage complex. The project is slated for completion in late 2024 and is anticipated to cost more than $100 million.“For nearly a century, Colonial Terminals has built its reputation by delivering world-class product handling services to dry and liquid bulk customers through our intermodal marine terminals,” Colonial Terminals President Ryan Chandler said in a Friday news release. “Leveraging our strategic infrastructure in partnership with Norfolk Southern to extend our reach into the breakbulk space is a logical next step for our high-service culture.”The project should also help stimulate growth in breakbulk, especially following the Georgia Ports Authority’s decision to convert its Ocean Terminal facility from handling breakbulk to handling containers, according to Chandler.“At Norfolk Southern, real estate assets are a strategic opportunity that we’re leveraging to drive smart, sustainable growth for our customers and our rail network,” said Kathleen Smith, NS vice president of real estate and business development. “This partnership furthers that mission, aligning our organizations to fulfill a critical supply chain need in the Southeast.”Story continuesSubscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inboxClick here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Georgia Ports Authority to shift breakbulk operations to BrunswickHouston, New Orleans ports see container volumes riseWhat is breakbulk?The post Colonial Terminals to expand breakbulk infrastructure in Georgia appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The collaboration is our first step in bringing innovative solutions to China's painting sector. ""We believe that this move will lead the industry trend in developing packaging with a smaller environmental footprint and will be recognized by more and more consumers and gain industry consensus, while contributing to the country's future dual carbon development goals,"" said Yi Bai, President of Nippon Paint China Procurement Headquarter. ""Through the innovation of packaging, our products will also be given a ‘new green coat.' ""A STEP FORWARD IN INNOVATIONLyondellBasell is delivering innovation in the outdoor sports segment. We worked with sports equipment specialist TSL to deliver a solution for an innovative snowshoe with recycled content. LyondellBasell provided CirculenRecover polyamide with approximately 80% recycled content for use in the snowshoe footbed, meeting TSL's needs for sustainability, extreme resistance and stylish design. Snowshoes need to be highly resistant to impact and cold temperatures and be durable over time.After several meetings and testing prototypes in real-life, rough conditions, the teams opted for the CirculenRecover product with mechanically recycled materials. As a world leader in snowshoe development and manufacturing, TSL's values are strongly connected to the respect of nature, well-being and innovation. TSL's challenge was to find recycled plastic materials that could fulfill all technical and visual requirements.""This recent collaboration yielded an excellent compatibility for both teams,"" said Yoan Bibollet, head of development at TSL. ""It was our first time working with LyondellBasell on the development of a new product, and we were impressed by the material and compounding experience of their teams. The plastic material which we selected for the footbed ticked all of the boxes.""Story continuesA CLEAR VISION FOR TOMORROWDriving change toward more sustainable packaging solutions can be challenging in a highly regulated setting like the pharmaceutical sector. Our CirculenRenew polymers offer a solution. We worked with Röchling Medical, part of Röchling Group, to create eye drop containers using CirculenRenew polymers. Known for producing high-quality, secure medication packaging, Röchling was searching for the right grade for its eye drop containers that would also offer sustainability benefits. After several trials, the project team chose a low-density polyethylene with high purity necessary for pharmaceutical applications, and ideal for use in blow molding. This innovative packaging meets product performance requirements while offering a lower carbon footprint through the sourcing of alternative, renewable feedstocks.ON THE ROAD TO A CIRCULAR FUTUREIn another example of value chain collaboration, LyondellBasell is collaborating with Audi to help close the loop on mixed automotive plastic waste. Audi is installing seatbelt buckle covers in its Q8 e-tron model line. These are made using LyondellBasell polymers that support the sourcing of feedstocks from mixed automotive plastic waste. As part of the PlasticLoop project, plastic components from customer vehicles which can no longer be repaired are dismantled, shredded and processed by advanced recycling into pyrolysis oil. The pyrolysis oil is then used as a raw material in the LyondellBasell manufacturing process for the production of new polymers, replacing fossil feedstocks. Recycled content is attributed to the Audi product via a mass balance approach and certified by ecocycle. With this process, LyondellBasell, Audi, and chemical recycler SynCycle (Next Generation Group and BDIBioEnergy International), succeed in recycling a stream of material which today is mostly only suitable for energy recovery.View the full LyondellBasell 2022 Sustainability Report.For information about the factors that could impact our forward-looking statements, please see page two of the LyondellBasell Sustainability Report.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from LyondellBasell on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: LyondellBasellWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/lyondellbasellEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: LyondellBasellView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/761759/LyondellBasell-2022-Sustainability-Report-Successful-Collaborations-Providing-a-New-Purpose-for-Plastic-Waste]"
240,21680658-5663-3520-8965-b03a716e55ab,VMC,2023-06-17,20 Largest Construction Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-largest-construction-companies-us-174321819.html,1686937401,STORY,"['VMC', 'CAT', 'LEN-B']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 largest construction companies in the US. To see more of these companies, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Construction Companies in the US.""A US Construction Golden Era""On June 9, Kathryn Thompson, the CEO of Thompson Research Group, was invited on CNBC's Last Call for an interview, where she offered vital insights into the current state of the US construction industry. In her opinion, the US is entering into a ""golden era"" as far as its construction industry is concerned. She believes that today the construction industry is benefiting from key growth drivers which are particularly beneficial for the infrastructure sector now. One of these key drivers is the ""structural shift in population of the South East and South West,"" while another key factor aiding the construction industry is the immense governmental support being offered to it. One major governmental move in this direction is President Joe Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021-2022, an act providing $550 billion in federal investments over five years to help the US build and improve its bridges, roads, and much more.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is being implemented through the IIJA, has been immensely successful between 2021 and 2022. According to the White House, by November 2022, the Biden Administration had announced over $185 billion in funding for over 6,900 projects across the US. By this time, the government had also successfully launched 2,800 bridge repair and replacement projects alongside awarding funds for more than 5,000 new clean transit and school buses. The amount of funds being awarded to the construction industry has thus far allowed for companies operating within this space, such as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), to truly benefit from such immense governmental support. It is this advantage, in light of the Biden Administration's interest in US infrastructure, that is leading professionals like Thompson to see the construction industry in an optimistic light today.Story continuesWill Rate Hikes Get In The Way Of The Construction Industry?While the construction industry has been having a good run since the IIJA, the economic condition within the US may pose a threat to its continued success. With rate hikes and inflation, construction projects are likely to become more expensive as the cost of construction materials skyrockets. With rising costs, the profits a construction company can bring in may take a hit. One way to deal with the situation is layoffs, with some construction companies going this route, according to a Bloomberg article published this May. In March, the US construction sector was seen to have laid off 9,000 employees across several companies. This may be an indicator that companies in this industry may not have everything easy after all.Yet, while companies are going this route, Bloomberg reported that in 2023, building activity is continuing to rise, and backlogs on construction projects seem to be supporting US construction even during a period of rising rate hikes. Additionally, many financial professionals now believe that the Federal Reserve may even be taking a break in June, letting the economy breathe before resuming rate hikes in July. This state of events may mean that the construction industry won't have to suffer for too long, if at all, making this an interesting area to keep an eye on as the year progresses. This is why we have compiled a list of the largest construction companies operating in the US today.20 Largest Construction Companies in the USPhoto by jonathan j castellon on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe selected the companies for our list by looking at their market capitalizations if they were public companies, and by calculating the estimated valuation for private companies.

241,e1e21d10-5bcd-30a2-a456-41d96ef0036a,GE,2023-06-17,GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 61% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ge-healthcare-technologies-inc-nasdaq-120042490.html,1687003242,STORY,"['GEHC', 'GE']","[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in GE HealthCare Technologies implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 7 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders have been selling lately A look at the shareholders of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 61% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about GE HealthCare Technologies. Check out our latest analysis for GE HealthCare Technologies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About GE HealthCare Technologies?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.GE HealthCare Technologies already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see GE HealthCare Technologies' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in GE HealthCare Technologies. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is General Electric Company with 14% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 10% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.9% by the third-largest shareholder.We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of GE HealthCare TechnologiesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$53m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in GE HealthCare Technologies. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 14% of GE HealthCare Technologies. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand GE HealthCare Technologies better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  GE HealthCare Technologies is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy How Fast Is Valero Energy Growing Its Earnings Per Share?In business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It's an outstanding feat for Valero Energy to have grown EPS from US$6.21 to US$37.73 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Valero Energy is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 7.5 percentage points to 11%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Valero Energy.Story continuesAre Valero Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Valero Energy has a market capitalisation of US$40b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$187m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.5% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is Valero Energy Worth Keeping An Eye On?Valero Energy's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, Valero Energy is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Valero Energy   you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

244,1c63eb9a-ddb8-3dda-ada4-038f95412a41,VLO,2023-06-17,Investors Heavily Search Valero Energy Corporation (VLO): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-valero-energy-130013197.html,1686920413,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned +2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has gained 2.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $5.54 per share, indicating a change of -51.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $22.20 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -23.9%. This estimate has changed -5.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.16 indicates a change of -36.2% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Valero Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -31.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $143.07 billion and $136.47 billion estimates indicate -18.9% and -4.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $36.44 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.27 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +26.14%. The EPS surprise was +14.23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:UNH) have greatly underperformed the market so far in 2023, with the stock falling more than 11% year to date.UnitedHealth: A High-Quality Name Offering Excellent ValueOver that same time, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 14%. While the stock has not participated in the recent rally, there are several reasons why value investors might want to consider adding UnitedHealth to their portfolio.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with UNH. Click here to check it out. UNH 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UNHPeter Lynch Chart of UNHRecent earnings highlightsUnitedHealth reported first-quarter earnings results that came in above analysts expectations. Revenue for the period improved 14.70% to $91.9 billion, which was $2.15 billion more than projected. Adjusted earnings per share of $6.26 compared favorably to $5.49 in the prior year and was 18 cents ahead of estimates.Looking at each business segment, UnitedHealthcares revenue improved 12.60% to $70.5 billion. Earnings from operations grew 13.50% and the operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 6.10%. Growth in this business was driven by the addition of nearly 2 million more people, with gains seen in all areas.Optums revenue growth was even higher at almost 25%. Earnings from operations improved 16%, though the operating margin contracted 40 basis points to 6.90%. Revenue per consumer surged 34% due to care services related to at-home, digital and in-clinic. Revenues for Optum Rx were up 15% due to new clients and an increase in prescriptions growing from 7.40% to 378 million.Following strong earnings results, management raised its forecast for 2023. Adjusted earnings per share are now projected to be in a range of $24.50 to $25, up from $24.40 to $24.90 previously. At the midpoint, this would represent an increase of 11.60% from 2022.TakeawaysBoth segments performed well during the period. Growth should continue as the UnitedHealthcare segment recently was awarded Medicaid contracts in Indiana and Texas, which should help increase the number of people served. Management expects to lead the market in the number of people severed through its offerings in Medicare Advantage.Story continuesCompany-wide earnings from operations did grow 16% to $8.10 billion, but the net margin fell 20 basis points to 6.10% sequentially. Margins contracted for UnitedHealth despite the mid-teens growth rate in earnings from operations as the company is making investments in its businesses. For example, UnitedHealth continues to expand Optums services and product offerings. This has resulted in high growth rates in the business. One positive note on this subject is the net margin improved 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year.Additionally, adjusted free cash flow totaled $5.10 billion, more than enough to cover the $3.50 billion the company spent on dividends and buybacks during the period.The upward revision in guidance for the year is also a positive, though the implied year-over-year growth is below the 10- and five-year compound annual growth rates of 16%. The revised midpoint still shows the double-digit growth that investors have come to expect from UnitedHealth.GuruFocus rankingsWhile the quarter was strong on most metrics, it is the overall quality of the company that I find appealing. GuruFocus appears to agree.Overall, UnitedHealth enjoys a GF Score of 97 out of 100. Stocks with scores in this range have the potential for outperformance based on research conducted by GuruFocus.With a score of this magnitude, UnitedHealth needs to perform well on every component, and it does. UnitedHealth receives a perfect score in the areas of profitability and growth and solid scores for value, financial strength, and momentum.UnitedHealth: A High-Quality Name Offering Excellent ValueFor profitability, nearly every current metric is well above the industry as well as near the high-end of UnitedHealths decade-long range. This includes top marks in net margin, return on equity and return on assets. The perfect score for growth is largely driven by near-term growth of free cash flow and earnings without nonrecurring items.If there are areas of concern, it is that debt-to-equity is near the bottom of the industry, but this metric has deteriorated because of recent acquisitions. This includes the $8 billion addition of Change Healthcare last year and the $5.4 billion purchase of LHC Group that closed earlier this year. That said, interest coverage remains very strong and the Piotroski F-score of 8 out 9 means that the fundamentals of UnitedHealth are very healthy.Dividend and valuation analysisGood business fundamentals have enabled UnitedHealth to regularly raise its dividend by a high rate. Case in point, the company announced a 14% dividend increase on June 7. This marks the 14th consecutive year of dividend growth.The last decade has seen a compound annual growth rate of 22%. The most recent increase is down compared to this growth rate, but it is closer to the medium-term CAGR of 16.7%. The dividend is likely secured given the companys ability to generate cash flow. The projected payout ratio for 2023 is just 29%. Shares yield 1.60%, which is slightly higher than the average yield of 1.54% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.Shares of UnitedHealth offer double-digit total return potential according to the GF Value chart.UnitedHealth: A High-Quality Name Offering Excellent ValueUnitedHealth has a current share price of $459.50, but a GF Value of $543.48, giving the stock a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.85. Reaching the GF Value from current levels would result in a 15.5% return before factoring in the dividend yield.Final thoughtsThe market has not been kind to UnitedHealth even as the S&amp;P 500 Index has enjoyed a solid rally year to date. I believe this has provided investors with an opportunity to acquire shares in the company at a reasonable price.The overall company is performing well, even if profitability has eroded some as a result of investments made to grow the business. Recent results were above estimates and UnitedHealth raised its guidance for the year. The company also has a near-perfect GF Score, indicating that shareholders could see outsized gains in the near future.The dividend was recently raised as well and shares offer mid-teens potential returns, which could make UnitedHealth a name investors may want to consider purchasing.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Most of that came from the 20% of cases that the government exercised its right to join and take over, with cases that whistleblowers litigated alone netting $3.5 billion in the same time period.Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have said that the fact that few cases in which the government did not intervene are successful shows why the Justice Department should exercise its power to dismiss ones lacking merit. That is something the department began doing more often under a 2018 policy adopted during Republican former President Donald Trump's administration of seeking the dismissal of ""meritless"" or ""parasitic"" lawsuits that the government did not back.Story continuesThe Justice Department sought dismissal of Polansky's lawsuit in 2019, citing concerns including the ""tremendous"" burden of requests for the government to produce documents. Executive Health Resources denied wrongdoing and argued that the department had the right to dismiss the case over Polansky's objections.The Supreme Court on June 1 ruled in another whistleblowers case involving the False Claims Act. In that 9-0 decision, the justices gave a boost to whistleblowers in their bid to revive lawsuits accusing pharmacy operators of knowingly overbilling government health insurance programs for prescription drugs at taxpayers' expense.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Additional reporting by John Kruzel in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

Most of that came from the 20% of cases that the government exercised its right to join and take over, with cases that whistleblowers litigated alone netting $3.5 billion in the same time period.Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have said that the fact that few cases in which the government did not intervene are successful shows why the Justice Department should exercise its power to dismiss ones lacking merit. That is something the department began doing more often under a 2018 policy adopted during Republican former President Donald Trump's administration of seeking the dismissal of ""meritless"" or ""parasitic"" lawsuits that the government did not back.The Justice Department sought dismissal of Polansky's lawsuit in 2019, citing concerns including the ""tremendous"" burden of requests for the government to produce documents. Executive Health Resources denied wrongdoing and argued that the department had the right to dismiss the case over Polansky's objections.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

ADP, Paychex, Inc. PAYX and Genpact Limited G.Industry: OutsourcingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2108911/3-stocks-to-watch-from-the-promising-outsourcing-spaceIncreased adoption of cloud computing and other emerging technologies, operational efficiency and reduced expenses on the back of the successful work-from-home trend and the hybrid working model have been driving competitive advantage besides increasing innovation and speed to market. These factors bode well for the Zacks Outsourcing industry.Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc. and Genpact Limited are some stocks that are likely to gain from the abovementioned industry trends. However, rising data security issues, thanks to increased dependency on technology, are concerns for the industry.Industry DescriptionOutsourcing is the practice of transferring control of certain operations, services or processes, previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources, to external resources or third-party contractors to improve operating efficiency by focusing on core business competencies. The Zacks Outsourcing industry comprises companies engaged in providing human capital management solutions, business management solutions and information technology solutions to human resource, payroll, benefits, and retirement and insurance services to small- and medium-sized businesses. Some industry participants also provide business process services with capabilities in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation in the United States and abroad.What's Shaping the Future of the Outsourcing Industry?A Healthy Demand Environment: Increasing demand for expertise in improving efficiency and reducing costs has benefited the industry over the past several years. The industry has witnessed growth in revenues, income and cash flow over the past few years, enabling most players to pursue acquisitions and other investments, and pay out stable dividends.Story continuesRising Dependency on Technologies: Most of the industry participants are also considering emerging technologies such as cloud computing to drive competitive advantage, increase innovation, improve speed to market and drive performance within the industry. The wider application of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be the biggest change induced by the pandemic. The adoption of AI should lower complications and simplify operations. This should aid the industry.Notably, industry players are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes in order to keep themselves flexible in any kind of operating environment.Growing Security Issues and Remedies: Increased dependency on technology has led to growing cases of hacking, identity theft and malicious payload deliveries. With work-from-home models being the new-normal professional scenario, remote infrastructure vulnerabilities and security gaps are being exploited to secure unauthorized access to proprietary systems and data.As a preventive measure to enhance data security and ensure cyber-resilience, secure access technologies such as VPNs, two-factor authentication and other ID and access-management controls for home workers, as well as increased monitoring and threat-detection tools, are being used. Outsourced service providers are also updating organizational policies (including Bring Your Own Device and work-from-home policies) and data breach protocols in order to reduce security risks. Adequate training of employees about emerging threats and data security issues is also being prioritized by several companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #84. This rank places it in the top 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.

255,d2d6390c-fd20-33ed-898e-4bf97e267487,PG,2023-06-17,Those who invested in Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) five years ago are up 122%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-procter-gamble-nyse-140037437.html,1686924037,STORY,['PG'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) share price is up 94% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 51% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 14% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Procter &amp; Gamble managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.1% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 14% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Procter &amp; Gamble has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Procter &amp; Gamble the TSR over the last 5 years was 122%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveProcter &amp; Gamble shareholders gained a total return of 14% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 17% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Procter &amp; Gamble better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Procter &amp; Gamble has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.But note: Procter &amp; Gamble may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Additionally, each of these stocks have high Zacks Ranks, suggesting strong near-term expectations for their stocks.McDonald’sMcDonald’s is a leading fast-food chain that currently operates more than 39,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The company mainly operates and franchises quick-service restaurants (QSRs) under the McDonald’s brand.Nearly 93% of the company’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local businesspeople. MCD’s revenues include sales by company-operated restaurants but primarily come in the form of franchise fees from the independently managed restaurants.Earnings have grown at a very stable and impressive rate from just $1.40 per share in 1999 to $10.45 per share today. That’s a CAGR of 8%. Because of its business model, MCD essentially charges rent to its restaurant owners and collects a franchise fee. This has been a very successful and enduring strategy.McDonald's currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 4% and are expected to grow 8% YoY. FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 5% and are projected to grow 9.3% YoY.Story continuesAdobeAdobe is one of the largest software companies in the world collecting licensing fees from customers, which form the bulk of its revenue. ADBE also offers technical support and education, which accounts for the balance.Not only have ADBE earnings grown steadily, but they have accelerated considerably in the last decade, forming the always desirable hockey stick chart. Adobe’s EPS have compounded at a ridiculous 14.4% annually over the last 25 years and its stock has appreciated over 9,000% over that period.Adobe currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. EPS is expected to grow 13.3% annually over the 3-5 years, in line with its long-term average, which is remarkable considering how large a company it is today.ADBE is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 39x, which is just above the industry average of 33x, and a bit above its 25-year median of 34x.PepsiCoPepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies. Its complementary brands include Frito-Lay snacks, Pepsi-Cola beverages, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices and Quaker foods. The company serves customers in more than 200 countries and territories.Earnings growth in PEP is about the smoothest up trending line in finance that I have seen. Over the last 25 years annual EPS have grown from $1.21 per share to $7.00 per share, which is a CAGR of 7.3%.Additionally, over the last 20 years, PEP has reduced its share count by 20% through persistent share buyback programs. This has further ensured upward movement in the stock.Making PepsiCo an even more compelling investment is its generous dividend, which yields 2.8%. Pepsi has increased its dividend every single year for the last 50 years, making it one of the very prestigious dividend king stocks. Over the last five years the dividend has been increased by 5.4% annually.Procter and GambleProcter &amp; Gamble is a multinational consumer goods behemoth that has established itself as a global leader in its industry. With a rich history spanning over 180 years, PG has built a reputation for delivering high-quality products and brands that are household names worldwide. The company operates across multiple categories, including beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric and home care, and baby care, with a diverse portfolio of well-known brands such as Gillette, Pampers, Crest, and Tide, among others.With a consistently growing portfolio of household products, as well as top-notch execution over decades, PG has built an impressive record of growing earnings.Procter and Gamble currently earns a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings are projected to grow 9% YoY, while sales are projected to grow 2.3% over the same period. FY23 earnings are expected to increase just 1% YoY, however FY24 is expected to resume growth, with estimates of an 8.3% YoY increase.If consistently growing earnings wasn’t enough to guarantee stock appreciation PG also has the strong tendency to return huge amounts of cash to shareholders. Though stock buybacks management has decreased share count by 17% over the last 15 years.Furthermore, the company offers a dividend yield of 2.6%, which it has increased by an average of 6.3% annually over the last five years. Procter and Gamble has paid a dividend for 132 years and has increased the dividend payment consecutively for 66 years.Bottom LineInvesting in stocks with a long-term trend of growing earnings per share can be a prudent strategy for investors seeking sustainable growth in their portfolios. By identifying companies that consistently improve their earnings over time, investors can potentially benefit from the compounding effect and capitalize on the long-term value creation.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is D.R. Horton (DHI). DHI is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.71. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.02. Over the past 52 weeks, DHI's Forward P/E has been as high as 11.57 and as low as 3.49, with a median of 9.20.DHI is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.63. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. DHI's industry has an average PEG of 0.80 right now. Within the past year, DHI's PEG has been as high as 1.14 and as low as 0.42, with a median of 0.64.These are just a handful of the figures considered in D.R. Horton's great Value grade.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the airline industry and skip to the top 5 airlines, check out 5 Best Airlines in the World in 2023. We previously reported that according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 2023 is the year that the airline industry will see its net profits doubling to approximately $10 billion, while operating profits surpass $22.4 billion. It is forecasted that more than 4.35 billion passengers will board flights in 2023, which is close to the 2019 levels, when 4.54 billion flew throughout the year. Revenues are also projected to exceed $800 billion this year, which suggests a solid recovery in the airline industry. IATA ascribes this strong performance to China lifting its COVID-zero policies, high cargo revenues despite the volume remaining lower than pre-pandemic levels, and moderating jet fuel prices. A KPMG report suggests that the global airline industry plummeted by $140 billion in 2020, recorded a $42 billion loss in 2021, and the loss for 2022 came in at $6.9 billion. The pandemic had a devastating impact on travel and leisure activities, but the airline industry is set to return to profitability next year. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the number of air passengers in 2022 rose about 47% compared to the prior year, and revenue passenger kilometers climbed by 70% during the same time. ICAO attributed this recovery in the industry to robust international travel. ICAO also noted growth of about 50% in the annual passenger revenues of airlines from 2021 to 2022, while keeping the yield and exchange rates aligned with 2019 levels. Another solid signal of recovery in the airline industry was the growing number of aircraft orders and deliveries by Airbus and Boeing. In 2022, these aircraft manufacturers received 53% more orders and delivered 20% more aircrafts as compared to 2021. The aircraft orders in 2022 surpassed 2019 levels. ICAO Council President Salvatore Sciacchitano commented: Story continues“Assuring the safe, secure, and sustainable recovery of air services will be key to restoring aviation’s ability to act as a catalyst for sustainable development at the local, national and global levels, and will consequently be vital to countries’ recovery from the broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”Don't Miss: Top 20 Most Profitable Airlines in the WorldAnother development in the airline industry is the introduction of electric air taxis. Commercial airlines are looking to invest in electric air taxis, as they will make trips to airports quicker for passengers and will potentially reduce wait times at the airports as a result. For example, CNBC reported that in October 2022, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) invested $60 million in Joby Aviation, Inc. (NYSE:JOBY), a company that manufactures electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), which will operate as air taxis. This investment resulted in a five-year partnership between the companies, where Joby’s eVTOLs will operate solely in Delta’s network. Similarly, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) partnered with Heart Aerospace, a Swedish startup, to get electric aircrafts running by 2030. United Airlines has two prior investments in eVTOLs – one for $15 million with Eve Air Mobility, which will supply 200 aircrafts, and another with Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE:ACHR) worth $10 million for 100 aircrafts. Additionally, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) also invested $25 million in Vertical Aerospace, a UK-based manufacturer of eVTOLs. American Airlines placed an order for 50 aircrafts. Savanthi Syth, the managing director of equity research at Raymond James who covers global airlines and mobility, noted that these agreements between airlines and eVTOL manufacturers are not concrete and depend largely on regulations and the ability of companies to produce them. Syth commented: “We think that you’ll see small amounts of [eVTOL] operations starting in the 2025 timeframe, with certifications hopefully happening in 2024. But for you to see a lot of aircraft flying overhead, it’s probably going to be more likely into the 2030s.”In the constantly evolving airline industry, there are too many options for passengers to choose from. Most individuals prefer airlines with the best safety, reliability, service, and quality ratings to ensure a smooth journey, so they are keen to check airline ratings from best to worst before making a decision. While some of the best airline stocks include Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), in this article we discuss the top 20 airlines in the world. Our Methodology For this article, we selected the top rated airlines by AirlineRatings.com and Skytrax World Airline Awards. As of June 15, 2023, Skytrax Awards had the latest airline ranking data for 2022. So we chose the 2022 data from both sources and came up with an average ranking method for our list. We chose an average ranking method since the criteria that the airlines are assessed on is fairly subjective, and averaging out the scores by these two organizations usually produces a better outcome. AirlineRatings.com and Skytrax World Airline Awards rank airlines based on safety records, on-time performance, comfort and amenities, quality of service, frequent flyer programs and loyalty rewards, international network and routes, environmental and sustainability initiatives, and price competitiveness, among others. 20 Best Airlines in the World in 2023Mikhail Starodubov/Shutterstock.comBest Airlines in the World in 202320.

A business management major, Kerry had long sought out extra opportunities and activities, such as DECA, a leadership prep group for high schoolers and college students. ""It was my thing in high school. I competed for three years and was president,"" Kerry says. ""I knew when I graduated, I wanted to find a leadership development program.""Lots of familiar corporate names entered the post-college job search in her hometown of Charlotte. Then she happened upon a LinkedIn job posting for Principal Financial Group®. ""I had never heard of Principal,"" Kerry says. ""But I did some research and liked what I saw.""That feeling, along with insights from key people along the way, helped Kerry navigate the Principal® interview, job offer, and eventual relocation halfway across the country to Des Moines. ""There was a connection I felt with people I had already met, and the culture felt different,"" she says. ""I knew I didn't want to miss out on it.""As Principal has discovered, nurturing those connections helps support diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, not just in communities and with customers, but also with employees. Those connections are multifaceted: support for Black-owned businesses, measurement of leadership representation, and celebrations old and new, such as the designation of Juneteenth as a Principal holiday.DEI: From global to localDEI isn't a goal with an end point: It's always on. Principal is continuing the work to increase diversity while making strides in areas such as gender. For example, women first received a seat on the board at Principal in 1980, and a Black woman joined the board two decades ago. Today, 46% of the management team are women.Story continuesAt Principal, inclusion translates into a work environment that's:based on integrity, respect, trust, and belonging,attracts and retains diverse talent, increases employee engagement, and develops the next generation of leaders, andis flexible so employees can integrate life and work.Lofty goals indeed, but how do we know we're making progress? Measurements can help.Inclusion: The Global People 2022 inclusion index, a measurement of authenticity and feeling valued among other factors, of 82% exceeds the goal of 80%.Leadership: 62% of Board of Director members are diverse in their gender, race, or national origin.Business support: In 2021, Principal committed to doubling the diverse small and midsize businesses it supports by 2025. In just its second year, we met 68% of the stated goal.Global employment: Currently, women make up 54% of the Principal global workforce; 16% in the United States are people of color.Outside recognitions: Principal was recognized as best place to work for LGBTQ+ Equality on the 2022 Corporate Equality Index by the Human Rights Commission Foundation.Those high-level initiatives become actionable in a variety of ways, including engaging employees through employee resource groups. Internally, the Principal African American/Black employee resource group (AABERG) hosted a virtual discussion reflecting on the history of Juneteenth and sharing practical steps to commemorate the meaning of the day.The origin of JuneteenthWhen the Emancipation Proclamation was issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863,1 the Southern states still under control of successionists scoffed.Over the next two years, state by state, however, Union forces had an opportunity to put force behind law- except in Texas. It wasn't until June 19, 1865, that enslaved people in Texas would learn that they too, had gained their freedom.2Since 1979, Texas has celebrated the anniversary of that momentous day as Juneteenth. In 2021, it became a federal holiday. That same year, Principal marked Juneteenth as an official corporate holiday, and to celebrate the occasion, the Juneteenth flag flew above the headquarters in Des Moines as employees and community members commemorated the day together.Principal® Foundation also funds a number of external initiatives such a grant to the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, which helps entrepreneurs and small business owners improve personal finances, and 1863 Ventures, a national business development non-profit for entrepreneurs that have been historically marginalized.Nationally, Black individuals3 and specifically Black women4 are becoming first-time entrepreneurs and business owners at one of the fastest rates in the country. Buying from these businesses on, before, and after Juneteenth helps.Dannie Patrick, another transplant to Des Moines and global inclusion specialist, has volunteered at a past local Juneteenth event. ""At Principal, we know that simply observing Juneteenth as a holiday is not enough for our employees. They want to be involved and actively volunteer to make an impact within the communities we serve,"" Patrick says.""Volunteering at Juneteenth Neighbor's Day is so important to me because it gives me and others the opportunity to see ourselves reflected back in the mirror, which happens less frequently here in Iowa,"" Patrick says. ""It's empowering and helps me keep going. Having an employer that acknowledges and supports that is why I am proud to say I'm a Principal employee.""Candid conversations for a more inclusive futureDuring Kerry's formal interviews, ""the tone was much different than other companies-very conversational and friendly,"" Kerry says. ""Everyone gave me the impression they wanted what was best for me. Principal did a great job during the process of making sure I was interviewed by people of color who work here, so we were able to talk about diversity and leadership.""Kerry started in April 2021 as a leadership development program associate. The early career program rotates associates in months-long assignments across Principal, helping them develop skills for an eventual placement as a leader with direct reports. Kerry relocated to Des Moines in September 2021, leaving behind family and her hometown. There have been challenges. There have been connections. There is still more work to be done.Fellow employees have helped her acclimate to Des Moines-hard in any situation, harder still when moving to a state that isn't as diverse as the community you've left behind. ""It's taken adjusting, but there are great things this time in my life has to offer,"" Kerry says.That includes competing in Miss Iowa and placing third; Kerry had never competed in a pageant before. It's also taking advantage of the doors that the leadership development program opens-and working to open more doors for others. ""I've had people advocate for me, and I want that for everyone,"" Kerry says. ""Hopefully some of the candid conversations we've had can make sure that we can continue to increase and then keep diversity in Iowa.""Principal Financial Group Foundation, Inc. (""Principal® Foundation"") is a duly recognized 501(c)(3) entity focused on providing philanthropic support to programs that build financial security in the communities where Principal Financial Group, Inc.

Designed to help comfort kids during their cancer or sickle cell disease journey, My Special Aflac Duck uses medical play and lifelike movement, and it mimics emotion to help children cope with their treatments.The event comes following the release of ""Dawn's List"" this past March. Created by Aflac in collaboration with Coach Staley, the list aims to address some of the equity issues in women's college sports, including investment equity, fan experience and community engagement. Aflac committed to several actions to address these gaps for female athletes, their fans and their communities, including efforts to bring awareness to coach and player achievements, enhancements to the on-site experience and the creation of opportunities that help athletes and coaches further establish themselves as role models by helping communities.

Additionally, each of these stocks have high Zacks Ranks, suggesting strong near-term expectations for their stocks.McDonald’sMcDonald’s is a leading fast-food chain that currently operates more than 39,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The company mainly operates and franchises quick-service restaurants (QSRs) under the McDonald’s brand.Nearly 93% of the company’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local businesspeople. MCD’s revenues include sales by company-operated restaurants but primarily come in the form of franchise fees from the independently managed restaurants.Earnings have grown at a very stable and impressive rate from just $1.40 per share in 1999 to $10.45 per share today. That’s a CAGR of 8%. Because of its business model, MCD essentially charges rent to its restaurant owners and collects a franchise fee. This has been a very successful and enduring strategy.McDonald's currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 4% and are expected to grow 8% YoY. FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 5% and are projected to grow 9.3% YoY.Story continuesAdobeAdobe is one of the largest software companies in the world collecting licensing fees from customers, which form the bulk of its revenue. ADBE also offers technical support and education, which accounts for the balance.Not only have ADBE earnings grown steadily, but they have accelerated considerably in the last decade, forming the always desirable hockey stick chart. Adobe’s EPS have compounded at a ridiculous 14.4% annually over the last 25 years and its stock has appreciated over 9,000% over that period.Adobe currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. EPS is expected to grow 13.3% annually over the 3-5 years, in line with its long-term average, which is remarkable considering how large a company it is today.ADBE is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 39x, which is just above the industry average of 33x, and a bit above its 25-year median of 34x.PepsiCoPepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies. Its complementary brands include Frito-Lay snacks, Pepsi-Cola beverages, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices and Quaker foods. The company serves customers in more than 200 countries and territories.Earnings growth in PEP is about the smoothest up trending line in finance that I have seen. Over the last 25 years annual EPS have grown from $1.21 per share to $7.00 per share, which is a CAGR of 7.3%.Additionally, over the last 20 years, PEP has reduced its share count by 20% through persistent share buyback programs. This has further ensured upward movement in the stock.Making PepsiCo an even more compelling investment is its generous dividend, which yields 2.8%. Pepsi has increased its dividend every single year for the last 50 years, making it one of the very prestigious dividend king stocks. Over the last five years the dividend has been increased by 5.4% annually.Procter and GambleProcter &amp; Gamble is a multinational consumer goods behemoth that has established itself as a global leader in its industry. With a rich history spanning over 180 years, PG has built a reputation for delivering high-quality products and brands that are household names worldwide. The company operates across multiple categories, including beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric and home care, and baby care, with a diverse portfolio of well-known brands such as Gillette, Pampers, Crest, and Tide, among others.With a consistently growing portfolio of household products, as well as top-notch execution over decades, PG has built an impressive record of growing earnings.Procter and Gamble currently earns a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings are projected to grow 9% YoY, while sales are projected to grow 2.3% over the same period. FY23 earnings are expected to increase just 1% YoY, however FY24 is expected to resume growth, with estimates of an 8.3% YoY increase.If consistently growing earnings wasn’t enough to guarantee stock appreciation PG also has the strong tendency to return huge amounts of cash to shareholders. Though stock buybacks management has decreased share count by 17% over the last 15 years.Furthermore, the company offers a dividend yield of 2.6%, which it has increased by an average of 6.3% annually over the last five years. Procter and Gamble has paid a dividend for 132 years and has increased the dividend payment consecutively for 66 years.Bottom LineInvesting in stocks with a long-term trend of growing earnings per share can be a prudent strategy for investors seeking sustainable growth in their portfolios. By identifying companies that consistently improve their earnings over time, investors can potentially benefit from the compounding effect and capitalize on the long-term value creation.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)New details have emerged about Tiger Cool Express’ financial health leading up to the company’s abrupt closure on Tuesday.A source familiar with the situation at the now-shuttered refrigerated rail shipping and logistics firm said Tiger Cool Express refinanced its equipment with Wells Fargo Bank a few years ago. The company had more than 700 53-foot temperature-controlled containers in its fleet, hauling produce, wine and frozen goods.The company was doing well until last spring, when the refrigerated market “blew a tire” and volumes dropped significantly, which contributed to Tiger Cool Express falling behind on its loan payment to Wells Fargo, according to the source. 5-year ROTVI— Reefer Outbound Tender Volume Index, which measures load tenders or requests from shipper to carrier for reefer loads (Chart: SONAR)Since Tiger Cool Express allegedly “broke its financial covenants” with Wells Fargo over the missed payments, the bank requested that the leased equipment be returned, the source said.On Friday, Wells Fargo spokesperson Melissa Eckmann confirmed that Tiger Cool Express is a customer but declined to share any details about the company’s financial state.Tiger Cool Express, which opened its doors in 2013, received $15 million from private equity firm Tiger Infrastructure Partners, which has offices in New York and London.Emily Nevins, an executive assistant at Tiger Infrastructure Partners, said the private equity firm is aware of the situation at Tiger Cool Express but has no plans to issue a statement. Other executives at Tiger Infrastructure Partners did not respond to FreightWaves’ request for comment.Tiger Cool Express executives, including Steve Van Kirk, CEO; Leslie Baird, chief commercial officer; and Theodore Prince, chief strategy officer, are also remaining silent about the closure of the logistics company. All three declined FreightWaves’ requests to be interviewed for this story.One former Tiger Cool Express worker told FreightWaves that employees were fired during a Zoom meeting on Tuesday. The Kansas City Business Journal was the first news outlet to report on company’s closure.Story continuesExpansion plan hits the skidsTwo months after Tiger Cool Express hosted a media day on April 12 to announce the future opening of Tiger Tri-Cities Logistics Center in Wallula, Washington, which was slated to open this month, the company abruptly pumped the brakes on the project and shut down the logistics company.The source who spoke to FreightWaves claims the company was going to be unable to pay its contractors for construction work on the intermodal terminal because of ongoing cash constraints.Patrick Reay, executive director at the Port of Walla Walla, said he found out Tiger Cool Express was ceasing operations from various news outlets.He said the port’s only involvement is that it owns the rail line that would be utilized for the intermodal facility. He added that the port “isn’t involved on the operations side of things.”“We are hopeful that new investors get involved and reconstitute the concept because it’s definitely a benefit to the Northwest,” Reay told FreightWaves.In December 2022, Tiger Cool Express signed a lease-purchase agreement to acquire the former Union Pacific Cold Connect warehouse, some property and to build an adjacent intermodal ramp in Wallula, Washington.In a press release issued in January about the agreement reached between Tiger Cool Express and Union Pacific Railroad to create Tiger Tri-Cities Logistics Center, Prince said the facility “has the potential to be a ‘triple threat.’”Tiger Cool Express’ Van Kirk was also quoted in the release about the project, stating, “Despite our continued growth and fleet expansion, we realize that the Pacific Northwest offers transformational potential for our company.”Reay said the buildings had remained closed since May 2020, when Union Pacific announced it was shuttering its Cold Connect refrigerated division and its Cold Connect warehouses in Wallula, Delano, California and Rotterdam, New York, citing “sluggish market conditions as a result of COVID-19.In 2017, Union Pacific acquired Railex LLC’s cold storage facilities and terminals. Railex raised $58 million through a public-private partnership in 2006 to fund its expansive infrastructure project to launch a cross-country refrigerated rail service.One former Tiger Cool Express worker thought the company was on solid footing after the company announced the deal with UP.

270,682b117b-5eae-3ff4-a876-f089d6f3f7bc,UNP,2023-06-17,Railroad industry sues to block new locomotive pollution rules in California,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/railroad-industry-sues-block-locomotive-190455385.html,1686942295,STORY,"['UNP', 'WAB']","[SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The railroad industry on Friday sued to block new environmental rules in California, arguing they would force the premature retirement of about 25,000 diesel-powered locomotives across the country long before their zero-emission counterparts are ready to take their place.California's aggressive strategy to fight climate change by weaning the state off fossil fuels has produced some of the world's toughest environmental regulations in the past few years. Since 2020, the state has OK'd rules that would ban the sale of new gas-powered cars, lawn equipment and trucks by the middle of the next decade.Those rules are designed to slowly phase out gas- and diesel-powered products by banning the sale of most new combustible engines. But the rules governing railroads would ban the use of locomotives more than 23 years old starting in 2030 and would force railroads to start setting aside more than $1 billion a year starting this fall solely to purchase zero-emission locomotives and related equipment. Due to the crucial role California ports hold and the way railroads pass off trains to each other, the state's mandate would have huge effects nationwide.In a lawsuit filed in federal court, the industry says the technology for zero-emission locomotives hasn't been sufficiently tested and won't be ready to carry the load of delivering more than 30 million carloads of freight nationwide each year.The lawsuit asks a judge to declare the California Air Resources Board does not have the authority to issue these rules. The trade groups say that only the federal government can regulate railroads because it is an interconnected industry that crosses state lines. They note that more than 500 companies all share the 180,000 miles (289,682 kilometers) of track across 49 states, Canada and Mexico.“While the urgency to act is real and unquestionable, CARB (the California Air Resources Board) uses unreasonable, flawed assumptions to support a rule that will not result in emissions reductions,” said Ian Jefferies, president and CEO of the Association of American Railroads, an industry trade association that filed the lawsuit along with the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association. ""Railroads are working toward reliable, efficient zero-emissions technologies; however, they cannot simply be willed into immediate existence by policymakers.”Story continuesThe railroad groups say in their lawsuit that the rules show regulators' “lack of experience with and understanding of the railroad industry.”Another argument from opponents of the California rule is that transporting goods through railways contributes fewer planet-warming emissions than if those goods were trucked. The transportation sector contributed the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in 2021, but rail only made up 2% of those emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.CARB spokesperson Lys Mendez said Friday the board had not yet seen the lawsuit and would not comment on it.Regulators say they must move quickly given the scope of the emissions problems from locomotives. CARB says the rules will dramatically reduce pollution from nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the formation of smog, and a type of tiny pollutants that can penetrate deep into a person's lungs and has been linked to cancer. The board estimates it will save $32 billion in health care costs and prevent 3,200 premature deaths.Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, called the fate of the California rule “a matter of life and death.”“There’s generally been a reckless disregard from the rail industry for saving lives from air pollution, and this is just another feather in their cap in their pursuit of continuing to burn really dirty diesel fuel,” Martinez said of the lawsuit.Alicia Aguayo, a spokesperson for the advocacy group People’s Collective for Environmental Justice, is also not surprised by the lawsuit. For more than two decades, Aguayo lived near a BNSF railyard in San Bernardino, California. Aguayo, whose brother has asthma, is concerned about the health risks diesel pollution from locomotives poses to residents.“For those of us that lived next to the railyards, it’s significant because it’s a step towards reducing something that is very harmful for our communities,” she said of the rule.The EPA said last fall that it will consider toughening its rules for locomotive pollution that were last updated in 2008, but California regulators acted first. The California rule would need approval from the EPA to move forward.California has some of the worst air quality in the country, mostly because of its bustling transportation sector. The state is home to two of the busiest ports in the world at Los Angeles and Long Beach. Most of that cargo is shipped to warehouses further inland before getting on trains to be transported throughout the country.The top four most polluted cities for ozone and year-round particle pollution in the U.S. are all in California, according to the American Lung Association.The new California rules would have the biggest effect on Union Pacific and BNSF and short-line railroads that operate in that state. But the changes would affect every railroad because they all regularly pass locomotives back and forth to keep trains moving efficiently across the U.S. A single locomotive might cross the entire country every couple of months. Any changes would have to be standardized across the industry.The major freight railroads are already working with major manufacturers to test out battery-powered locomotives with the first ones starting to roll out to Union Pacific railyards in Nebraska and California this year. They're also experimenting with alternative fuels like hydrogen as possible replacements for their diesel-powered workhorses.One of the leading locomotive makers, Wabtec, told California regulators that it is at least a couple years away from having battery-powered locomotive prototypes ready for widespread tests hauling freight over long distances, although it did try one out with BNSF for a few months in 2021. Wabtec also said some of the other technologies like hydrogen power face challenges related to the availability of that fuel and the need for an entirely new fueling network. And battery manufacturers may already have a hard time keeping up with all the demand from electric cars, even without upgrading thousands of locomotives.Railroads prefer to keep using locomotives for decades after they buy them. Just last year, both Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern announced plans to modernize hundreds of locomotives in their fleets to extend their useful life and reduce their carbon emissions. Those upgrades don't do much to reduce the amount of particulate matter and nitrous oxide emissions those locomotives produce, but the industry has made progress with those also. Those emissions are associated with increased cancer risks and other health problems — particularly in neighborhoods around railyards.___Funk reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

272,6cc19c71-f730-3e12-a6ea-39a93142c1ca,GPS,2023-06-17,Gap (NYSE:GPS) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $0.15,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-nyse-gps-affirmed-dividend-135202853.html,1686923522,STORY,['GPS'],"[The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.15 per share on the 26th of July. This means the annual payment is 6.2% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Gap Gap Doesn't Earn Enough To Cover Its PaymentsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Even though Gap isn't generating a profit, it is generating healthy free cash flows that easily cover the dividend. This gives us some comfort about the level of the dividend payments.The next 12 months is set to see EPS grow by 196.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could get very high, which probably can't continue without starting to put some pressure on the balance sheet.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.50 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 1.8% per annum over that time. It's encouraging to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth anyway, which makes this less attractive as an income investment.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Earnings per share has been sinking by 35% over the last five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.Gap's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Gap's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Gap that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

273,a7349dd4-7f6b-346b-9e56-1a381d59947f,CSCO,2023-06-17,Top 20 Most Profitable Tech Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-most-profitable-tech-154333642.html,1686930213,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'NVDA', 'HPQ', 'TMO', 'ACN', 'QCOM', 'AAPL', 'INTC', 'CSCO', 'META']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the top 20 most profitable tech companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most profitable tech companies in the world.The tech industry may be one of the biggest industries in the world, but 2022 was a disastrous year, with the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index, an index which tracks tech companies in the country, down over 35% as opposed to a 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500. While tech companies saw share prices jump astronomically during the Covid-19 pandemic and also post recovery, resulting in many major tech companies going on hiring sprees. However, 2022 was a year full of uncertainty, resulting in the worst first half in more than half a century for stocks in the U.S., as economic uncertainty and inflation resulted in increasing pressure on earnings and stock performance, while higher interest rates to battle rising inflation only increased the strain on stock returns. War between Russia and Ukraine simply added to a tumultuous year, all of which combined to see 2022 become the first year in which the NASDAQ, on which several of the most profitable tech companies in the world are listed, drop in value in four quarters.Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) alone lost around tw0-thirds of its entire value, a lot of it predicated on the belief that the metaverse is failing, which is not good news for some of the biggest metaverse companies in the world. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), another major tech company, though surprisingly not among the most profitable tech companies, had losses in the trailing twelve months. IPOs have also declined as companies which have had IPOs recently haven't performed too well in the stock market, as opposed to the most profitable tech companies in the world.Top 20 Most Profitable Tech Companies in the WorldPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashAll of this has led to tens of thousands of job cuts across major and minor tech companies, with almost all major companies significantly reducing headcount, reversing hiring sprees carried out at the height of the pandemic. However, that doesn't mean that it's all doom and gloom for tech investors. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has branched into AI, purportedly the next big thing in tech, has seen its stock price jump over 170% in just 2023, and breached the trillion dollar mark in the same year. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) saw its stock price increase by a more modest but still significantly healthy 37% while Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock price jumped by nearly 45%.Story continuesOne of the reasons behind this recent increase in tech stock prices is the AI craze, which may have been going on for a few years, but has reached the next level towards the end of 2022, driven by the release and success of ChatGPT and the hope of less aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed. NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) brilliant earnings report cemented its position as the global AI leader while other tech companies are also making significant investments in the artificial intelligence sector. According to Victoria Greene, the Chief Investment Officer in G Squared Private Wealth ""“Being concentrated in these mega-cap tech stocks has been where to be in this market. You cannot deny the potential in AI, you cannot deny the earnings prowess that these companies have.” Meanwhile, the CFO of  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stated in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call ""Record revenue of 4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 14% year on year on strong growth of our accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets. Let me give you some color across our three major customer categories: Cloud service providers or CSPs, consumer internet companies, and enterprises.""While there is some concern that artificial intelligence is growing too quickly and poses a threat to humanity, as outlined in a letter written by industry leaders, including Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who are considered the ""godfathers"" of artificial intelligence. All of this goes to show that investors who have suffered in 2022 are now seeing returns on their investment in 2023, and this increase in profits is likely to continue in at least the immediate future. Right now, the top four performing companies in the S&amp;P 500 index are all tech companies, including some of the most profitable tech companies in the world, which has led to the Nasdaq increase 25% overall in YTD 2023, far outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index which has returned 9.5% YTD and the Dow Jones Index, which has returned -0.2% in the same time period.MethodologyTo determine our list of the most profitable global technology companies, we first consulted the Fortune Global 500 list and highlighted the top 30 companies with the highest profits. We then checked the latest trailing-twelve-month (TTM) profit from continuing operations for each company from Yahoo Finance, to exclude any one-offs which don't truly reflect a company's operations or profits. For companies which had profits in foreign currencies, we converted them to USD based on the latest exchange rates. For Huawei, which is not listed, we obtained its net profit from its annual report. We then sorted the list from highest profits to lowest. Together, these companies have earned nearly $450 billion in net profits alone.20. HP Inc.
