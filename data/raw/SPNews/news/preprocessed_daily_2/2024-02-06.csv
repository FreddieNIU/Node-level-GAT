If I listened to Warren Buffett on this, I might sell the stock.', 'Have I ever mentioned that one of my favorite aphorisms is “consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds?” Like First Republic Bank, Schwab bought a huge volume of extremely low-yielding government bonds during the pandemic. As rates rose, the bonds lost resale value while also generating anemic income. If the bonds were marked down far enough, Schwab might not have enough capital to support its business.', 'Unlike First Republic Bank, however, Schwab continued gathering billions of dollars of brokerage assets all year, shoring up its capital position. The flow of new money into Schwab meant it had plenty of capital on hand, even after marking down the value of longer-dated bonds. Schwab’s acquisition and integration of TD Ameritrade has been rocky – we use Schwab as our primary custodian and sometimes feel the pain. But Schwab retains a tremendous level of trust with retail investors and remains a great value partner to investment advisors like me.

When companies split their shares, it's usually an indication that management feels the company is in a growth phase. Stock-split stocks are usually industry leaders with proven track records, and there's some data to support the idea that stock-split stocks perform well over time. Stock splits themselves don't do anything for stocks other than split them into smaller pieces."", 'However, something else recently happened to Walmart stock that has real implications for shareholders and indicates much more value. In 2023, Walmart became a Dividend King.', 'Companies become Dividend Kings when they pay and raise their dividends for 50 consecutive years. Walmart raised its dividend for the 50th time since 1974 last year when it raised it 2% to $2.28 per quarter.', ""Dividend Kings are an exclusive class of stocks that indicates strength and reliability. Lots of things can happen in a 50-year time span, and many companies don't last that long. Even the ones that do typically go through ups and downs that could impact their performance and ability to generate enough cash to operate and cover their dividends."", ""Any company that can weather the effects of 50 years of doing business while continuing to raise its dividends has demonstrated that it's trustworthy for passive income."", ""When evaluating a dividend, investors typically look at its yield. That's definitely one important factor, and high-yielding dividends have a place in many investors' portfolios. But there's more to a dividend stock than its yield. In fact, if the yield is too high, that should alert investors to potential risk. Not all dividend-paying stocks are established and reliable. Some of them suspend their dividends, and some of them go bust."", ""Others might be good candidates because they always pay, but they don't always raise their dividends. That could mean there's some trouble internally, or that the dividend isn't a priority. Companies that raise their dividends annually are committed to creating shareholder value."", ""At first glance, Walmart's dividend isn't great. It yields 1.35% at the current price, which is below the S&P 500 average. It's actually dropped a bit since the yield works inversely with price movement, and Walmart's stock has jumped on the news of its stock split."", ""But according to the other important factors that indicate a good dividend, Walmart's dividend checks all the boxes. Walmart is the top U.S. company by sales, and by far, with $639 billion. Amazon continues to trail it in second place, with $554 billion. It generates steady cash flow that drives the business and the dividend. It's not a growth stock, and the dividend is one of the ways that it attracts investors and creates shareholder value."", ""One of the reasons management might have decided that now is a good time for a stock split is that Walmart is performing beautifully. Sales increased 5.2% year over year in its fiscal 2024's third quarter (ended Oct. 31), driven by a 4.9% increase in comparable sales.

(AP) — Atlantic City's casinos have no legal obligation to stop compulsive gamblers from betting, a judge ruled, dismissing a lawsuit from a self-described problem gambler who accused the Borgata and its parent company, MGM Resorts International, of plying him with offers to gamble despite knowing about his addiction."", 'U.S. District Court Judge Madeline Cox Arleo dismissed a lawsuit on Jan. 31 by Sam Antar against the gambling companies, saying the voluminous rules and regulations governing gambling in New Jersey do not impose a legal duty upon casinos to cut off compulsive gamblers.', 'New Jersey casino law “pervasively regulates the responsibilities of casinos as they relate to compulsive gamblers, but is notably silent on whether casinos or online gambling platforms may induce people who present with compulsive gambling behavior to patronize their businesses,” the judge wrote in her decision.', 'She also cited two previous New Jersey cases in which a compulsive gambler and a patron who claimed to have lost money gambling while drunk sued unsuccessfully.', 'Similar lawsuits have been dismissed in other states, including Indiana.', '“The New Jersey Legislature ... has not yet seen fit to require casinos to prevent or stop inducing gambling from those that exhibit problem gambling behavior,"" Arleo wrote. “As a matter of law, (the) defendants do not owe a negligence common law duty of care to plaintiffs.”', 'Antar said the law needs to be changed, adding he plans to appeal the dismissal of the case.', '“This is not just about me; this is about all the people across this country who have this addiction,” he said. “When are we as a country going to address this?”', 'New Jersey, like other states, has a program in which gamblers can voluntarily exclude themselves from in-person or online betting. The casinos must honor that list and have been fined by regulators for allowing self-excluded gamblers to place bets.', 'Antar, who has homes in New York and in Long Branch, New Jersey, gambled $30 million over 100,000 bets during nine months in 2019, according to his lawsuit, which does not specify how much he actually lost. Antar said he is not certain of the amount, and his lawyer, Matthew Litt, said it was “at least in the six figures.”', 'His lawsuit made some of the same claims that were raised — and rejected by a judge — in another person’s lawsuit targeting Atlantic City casinos. In 2008, a federal judge ruled against New York gambler Arelia Taveras who sued seven Atlantic City casinos that she said had a duty to stop her from gambling. She lost nearly $1 million over two years, including dayslong gambling binges.', '“She spent money on the bona fide chance that she might win more money,” U.S. District Court Judge Renée Bumb wrote in a 2008 ruling. “In short, she gambled. The mere fact that defendants profited from her misfortune, while lamentable, does not establish a cognizable claim in the law.”', 'MGM cites that case among its numerous defenses to Antar’s litigation, and said it did not create or worsen a gambling problem in Antar or anyone else.', 'The company declined comment Monday.', ""Litt said his appeal will center on his contention that New Jersey's Consumer Fraud Act, designed to protest customers from “unconscionable” acts by companies, should apply in this case."", 'Antar is the nephew of Eddie Antar, who founded the Crazy Eddie electronics stores in the 1970s and 1980s.

Cruise stocks weren't exactly popular during the month, and Norwegian is viewed by some as one of the riskier publicly traded cruise companies."", ""For example, Wells Fargo analyst Daniel Politzer downgraded his outlook for Norwegian stock on Jan. 5 while simultaneously upgrading his outlook for competitor Carnival. According to Investing.com, Politzer was looking at Norwegian's more modest upside opportunity and its relatively high debt load. Moreover, the company's execution hasn't been perfect."", ""To this latter point, in its third-quarter earnings call on Nov. 1, Norwegian's management said that geopolitical conflicts were leading to higher cancellations and lower bookings for the upcoming fourth quarter. Consequently, the company expects to report an adjusted loss per share of $0.15 for the quarter."", ""For perspective, its top rivals Carnival and Royal Caribbean don't expect adjusted losses, so it calls Norwegian's execution into question for some investors."", ""Against this backdrop, it's understandable why some investors may find Norwegian stock the least attractive of the three big publicly traded cruise stocks."", 'The good news for Norwegian shareholders is that the company is increasing its capacity. By bringing more ships online, the company could sail with 22.7 million cruisers in 2023, which was an 18% year-over-year increase. Moreover, the company has kept ships mostly full, even if the upcoming Q4 has elevated cancellations.', ""Politzer mentioned Norwegian's elevated debt levels. Indeed, the chart below does show high debt compared with its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), especially relative to its peers."", ""But give Norwegian some credit. Through the first three quarters of 2023, the company reduced its debt by $1.5 billion. That's about a 10% reduction in debt in just nine months, which is nothing to sneeze at."", 'Still, Norwegian may have modest upside right now compared to other cruise stocks. It only expects to increase its capacity by 4% in 2024 -- for comparison, Carnival expects a 5.4% increase in 2024 capacity.', ""Over the long term, Norwegian expects more increases in capacity. And some analysts believe that the company's growth could contribute to its EPS tripling through 2027. That could indeed point to some long-term upside for the stock if things go right."", 'However, it may be prudent to wait and see if Norwegian can perform with a little more consistency before investors give it the full benefit of the doubt. If growth in 2024 is as modest as expected, there might still be plenty of time before the stock takes off, which would allow investors more time to better evaluate its performance.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Norwegian Cruise Line right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Norwegian Cruise Line, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Norwegian Cruise Line wasn’t one of them.

Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates were cut sharply as the analysts factored in the latest outlook for the business, concluding that they were too optimistic previously.', ""Following the latest downgrade, the 24 analysts covering Microchip Technology provided consensus estimates of US$6.2b revenue in 2025, which would reflect a sizeable 28% decline on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to crater 54% to US$2.00 in the same period. Previously, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$7.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.05 in 2025. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Microchip Technology's prospects, administering a substantial drop in revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot."", ' See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', ""Analysts made no major changes to their price target of US$92.56, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Microchip Technology's valuation."", 'Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 23% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2025. That is a notable change from historical growth of 13% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 16% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Microchip Technology is expected to lag the wider industry.', ""The most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. We're also surprised to see that the price target went unchanged. Still, deteriorating business conditions (assuming accurate forecasts!) can be a leading indicator for the stock price, so we wouldn't blame investors for being more cautious on Microchip Technology after the downgrade."", ""So things certainly aren't looking great, and you should also know that we've spotted some potential warning signs with Microchip Technology, including a weak balance sheet.

The technology, which Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, says is currently in development, would inform users when an image they see in their feed has been generated using artificial intelligence.', 'Currently, Meta adds a watermark and metadata to images generated using its Meta AI software. Now, however, the company is looking to expand that capability to images generated by contemporaries like Adobe (ADBE), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Midjourney, Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI, and Shutterstock (SSTK).', 'Clegg says Meta is working with the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit made up of academics, civil society professionals, and media organizations dedicated to ensuring AI has “positive outcomes for people and society,” to come up with standards that can be used to identify AI images across the web.', 'Experts say generative AI images could create a tsunami of disinformation in the lead-up to the election. We’re already seeing some of what’s to come in real time. When former President Trump was arrested in New York in 2023, images of what appeared to be of him running from police began spreading across the web.', 'And a likely AI-generated image of an explosion outside of the Pentagon that hit the internet last year briefly sent stocks sliding in New York in 2023 before officials said there was nothing out of the ordinary.', 'While Meta’s moves will help identify AI-generated images, they won’t be able to recognize AI-generated videos or audio. To that end, Clegg said, the company is adding a feature that people can use to label AI-generated video and audio they share across Meta. If users don’t, he explained, they may face penalties.', '“While companies are starting to include signals in their image generators, they haven’t started including them in AI tools that generate audio and video at the same scale, so we can’t yet detect those signals and label this content from other companies,” he said.', 'AI-generated audio and videos have already been used to spread disinformation. In 2022, a deepfake video of a phony Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky telling troops to put down their weapons hit the web. And in January, a deepfake audio recording of a fake President Biden telling voters not to take part in the presidential primary went out in New Hampshire.', 'Clegg also pointed out that though Meta will be able to identify AI-generated images, there are still ways that those markers can be manipulated or removed. To prevent that, he said, the company’s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team is working on a way of implanting a watermark into an image while it’s being generated so that it can’t be removed.', 'Generative AI content is still a new concept to many people on the web. And while the concept of Photoshopping an image isn’t novel, the ability to generate a huge number of images in no time and flood social media with them is.', 'The deluge of AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift that circulated across sites, including X, formerly known as Twitter, illustrates how easy it is for such content to propagate across huge swaths of the internet in no time. Meta’s solution is just one tool in what will have to be an expansive chest of options to combat the new generation of misinformation.', 'On Monday, Meta\'s Oversight Board criticized the company over how it currently handles manipulated video content.

In addition to ads, Alphabet also has a fast-growing cloud computing operation as well as a services business which includes purchases through its app store and hardware devices."", ""Despite its diversified business, the overwhelming majority of Alphabet's operating profits come from the advertising business. For this reason, it's pretty consistent that investors keep a close eye on the performance of Alphabet's advertising services."", 'For the period ended Dec. 31, Alphabet generated $65.5 billion in advertising revenue -- up 11% year over year. And for the full year 2023, advertising revenue was up just 6% annually.', ""Competition in the advertising space has risen dramatically over the last couple of years. Platforms such as TikTok\xa0and Meta Platforms-owned Facebook and Instagram are all gaining momentum across different demographic segments. Furthermore, Amazon's advertising business is also making significant inroads in the space."", ""To make matters more complex, the macroeconomic environment has been plagued by lingering inflation and high borrowing costs. Subsequently, businesses of all sizes have been much more careful with their budgets and where to allocate capital. The combination of rising competition and tighter budgets has undoubtedly impacted Alphabet's core business -- from revenue to profits."", ""Given this dynamic, some investors may be wondering if it's time to move on from Alphabet. However, by zooming out and looking at the bigger picture, the long-term investment thesis around Alphabet goes far beyond its ads business."", 'One theme that underscores the best businesses is expanding outside of your legacy products. For example, Microsoft evolved from being the developer of the Windows operating system to a giant corporation spanning gaming, cloud computing, and hardware devices. I see Alphabet at a similar point in its lifecycle. Given the challenges facing its ads business, the company needs to prove that it has more to offer.', ""While it trails Amazon and Microsoft by a notable margin, Alphabet's cloud operation is quickly becoming an important pillar for the business. In 2023, Alphabet's cloud business grew 26% year over year to $33 billion. Furthermore, the cloud unit generated $1.7 billion of operating income -- compared to a loss of $1.9 billion in 2022."", ""Not only did Google Cloud Platform's growth outpace that of Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services, but it has swung to a profitable segment in just one year. Some contributors to Google Cloud's growth include its unique leverage of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and cybersecurity use cases. The intersection of AI and cybersecurity is important, and Alphabet's strategic acquisitions in these industries over the last couple of years are already yielding accelerating growth and profits."", 'With growth being top of mind for many investors, particularly in the tech sector, Alphabet may not be seen as the best opportunity at the moment. While I understand the concerns surrounding the advertising business, I also see the cloud business as overlooked. More importantly, the investments the company is making in AI to ignite growth across its entire ecosystem also appear to be underappreciated, if not misunderstood.', ""As of this writing, Alphabet stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21 -- essentially in line with that of the S&P 500. Nevertheless, compared to historical averages, this forward P/E level doesn't imply a rock-bottom valuation by any means.

While total revenue increased 18% year over year to $62 billion, the cloud division was the big winner."", 'One reason why the cloud is becoming increasingly important for Microsoft is its infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) features into the platform.

Most of Alphabet's revenue comes from selling advertising spots on platforms like Google Search and YouTube, so the company suffered a slowdown during those periods as businesses trimmed their marketing spending."", 'But the worst of those conditions appears to be in the past. In the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31), Google Search delivered a record-high $48 billion in revenue, which equaled a 12.7% year-over-year increase. It was the fastest pace of growth since mid-2022, right before interest rates shot higher.', ""YouTube's quarterly ad revenue also jumped 15.5% to a record $9.2 billion."", ""Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in Google Search, in particular. Alphabet launched two powerful generative AI models called Bard and Gemini in 2023, the latter of which outperforms OpenAI's flagship GPT-4 models in most multimodal benchmarks. In other words, Alphabet can make the case that Gemini is better at understanding, interpreting, and generating text, images, videos, and computer code."", 'Generative AI is now embedded in Google Search. When you enter a query, Google produces a text-based response at the top of the results, which saves you from sifting through webpages to find answers. Alphabet calls this Search Generative Experience (SGE), and the company says Gemini is delivering responses 40% faster than previous models for U.S. users.', ""GSE will help Google maintain its 91.4% global market share in internet search. Microsoft's ChatGPT-powered Bing was first to market with a generative AI search engine, which threatened Google's dominance and left Alphabet playing catch-up. If Google becomes faster, more convenient, and more accurate, it's likely to keep its user base and advertisers happy."", ""Google Cloud is Alphabet's answer to the top two cloud computing platforms, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. It generated a record $9.2 billion in revenue for Alphabet in Q4, equaling 25.7% year-over-year growth -- comfortably outpacing both Google Search and YouTube."", ""Google Cloud is also home to a number of Alphabet's AI initiatives. It has developed its own tensor-core processors (TPUs) and graphics processors (GPUs) for the data center, which were designed to give Google Cloud an edge over competitors that use chips from industry leader Nvidia. Alphabet says this strategy delivers both cost and performance advantages, and it's attracting leading AI developers like Anthropic (a start-up in which Amazon recently invested $4 billion)."", ""Vertex AI is Google Cloud's enterprise AI platform, where businesses and developers can access more than 130 generative AI models, including those built by third-party developers and Alphabet's own Gemini. This helps Google Cloud customers accelerate the development of AI applications for their own purposes. Vertex AI saw an impressive sixfold increase in activity in the second half of 2023 compared to the six months prior."", ""Based on Google Cloud's latest financial results, it should deliver around $40 billion in total revenue during 2024. That's less than half the $100 billion in revenue Amazon Web Services expects to generate, which tells you how far behind Google Cloud is. However, AWS only grew by 13% in Q4 compared to Google Cloud's 26%, which suggests Google Cloud is gradually taking market share."", ""Alphabet's revenue for 2023 came in at $307.4 billion, with $73.8 billion dropping to the bottom line as net income (profit). That translated into $5.80 in earnings per share, an increase of 27.2% compared to 2022."", ""The result places Alphabet shares at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 24.6.

I'm not suggesting it will soar that high, but the company's accelerating growth and record financial results warrant a valuation more in line with the Nasdaq-100, at the very least."", ""The size of Google Cloud relative to AWS and Microsoft Azure is one reason for the discount. Cloud services carry lofty profit margins because they are highly scalable, so investors have placed a premium on the valuations of Amazon and Microsoft based in part on their dominance in that segment.

This suggests efficient capital utilization, highlighting Chevron’s prolonged capability to generate higher returns on the capital employed in its operations.', 'Finally, Chevron maintained a strong balance sheet.

Like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX), McDonalds is experiencing a meaningful business impact from the war between Israel and Hamas. Weighted down by weak sales growth across the Middle East, China and India, the burger chain reported its first sales miss in almost four years.', 'Both Starbucks and McDonalds issued a public statement in attempt to fight misconceptions and untangle their respective brands from controversies related to the war that led to boycotts affecting their stores not only in the Middle East but across the globe.', 'Despite government support, consumer spending at McDonald’s second largest market remained weak. Starbucks also reported its recovery in China is going slower than expected.', 'For the December quarter, McDonalds reported revenue rose 8% to\xa0$6.41 billion, falling short of $6.45 billion that LSEG expected. Same-store sales grew 3.4%, also falling short of StreetAccount’s 4.7% estimate with international developmental licensed markets segment reporting a same-store sales increase of only 0.7%. Domestic store sales grew in line with expectations, more precisely at 4.3% due to price hikes, efficient marketing and increase in digital and delivery orders. However, McDonald’s did not disclose if U.S. traffic continued to fall after the reported drop in the previous, third, quarter.', 'Net income amounted to $2.04 billion, or $2.80 per share\xa0and adjusted earnings amounted to $2.95 per share after excluding restricting costs and other one-time items.', 'As for the annual 2023 revenue, sales grew 10% compared to 2022, as they amounted to\xa0$25.49 billion.', 'The fast-food giant topped analyst estimates on the earnings front,\xa0\xa0but posted a rare sales miss due to international market weaknesses. However, McDonald’s isn’t thinking of slowing down as it plans to spend\xa0between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion on capital expenditures, with half of those funds aimed at opening new stores across the U.S. and international markets.', 'Last week, Starbucks lowered its annual outlook partly due to lowered sales and traffic at its Middle East stores and McDonald’s is also expecting the negative impact on its sales from the ongoing war to continue until the conflict is resolved. Yet, despite pressures, McDonald’s\xa0reiterated\xa0its December guidance with new restaurants increasing its sales growth by almost 2%, showing it remains confidence in the resilience of its business despite lingering macroeconomic challenges.', 'DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The stock had a volatile 2023, even though it ended up rising by 12% last year, a gain that underperformed the S&P 500.', ""But it's always good to adopt a long-term approach when investing in the stock market. As we look out a decade from now, where could this up-and-coming coffee stock be?"", ""It's not a surprise that investors are probably most drawn to this stock because of its growth potential. Dutch Bros added 159 net new locations to its footprint in 2023, which represented 24% year-over-year growth. The current count of 831 is significantly higher than 370 at the end of 2019."", ""The company's drive-thru format, primarily in the western and southern parts of the U.S., has caught on with consumers. Dutch Bros emphasizes drink customization, continuous menu innovations, and increased accessibility and convenience that seem to be working."", 'Management has huge ambitions. They have set a target to have 4,000 stores open within the next 10 to 15 years. That would translate to a nearly fivefold increase in the store base. I think the best possible outcome for Dutch Bros is to have 4,000 locations open by the end of 2034.', 'As the company scales up to reach this figure, its revenue and same-store sales will likely be rising at a rapid clip. And this is exactly what shareholders would want to see from a retail business.', 'Dutch Bros reported operating income of $44 million in the first nine months last year, resulting in a low margin of 6%. As you can imagine, with so much capital being invested toward opening new stores, profitability has been an afterthought. With the possibility of 4,000 stores open a decade from now, earnings should skyrocket. And this will prove that Dutch Bros is a financially viable enterprise.', 'At this point, the leadership team could even consider more favorable capital allocation policies. This includes the possibility of paying out dividends or repurchasing shares, both of which can boost shareholder returns.', ""Now that we've gotten the most optimistic outcome out of the way, let's look at why I think things will be extremely challenging for Dutch Bros over the next 10 years."", ""The most important factor that will get in the way is the intense competition in the industry. A jaw-dropping 80% of new restaurants fail within the first five years. To Dutch Bros' credit, though, it has already created a proven model with a meaningful nationwide footprint."", ""But just look at some of the players that the company competes with. There's the juggernaut that is Starbucks, which has over 16,400 stores in the U.S. Starbucks is one of the most powerful brands in the world. It's a household name, and it has been extremely profitable for a long time."", ""Even though Starbucks is already ubiquitous, its executives have plans to open about 3,500 new stores in the U.S. This likely means that Dutch Bros will have to compete with Starbucks when it comes to finding favorable locations for new locations. That won't be easy."", ""There's also competition from the likes of McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts, and Restaurant Brands' Tim Hortons, not to mention the unlimited number of independent and local coffee shops that consumers enjoy. This makes me lack confidence in Dutch Bros ever reaching its 4,000-store target."", ""It's also going to be extremely capital-intensive for the business to build more locations, particularly as most of the stores are not franchised. Consequently, I worry that the company will need to raise capital to fund this growth, as it doesn't have a long and consistent track record of positive earnings."", ""Even though the stock is 64% below its peak price, I'm not buying Dutch Bros shares right now. There's simply too much uncertainty as we look out over the next 10 years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dutch Bros wasn't one of them.

The Motley Fool's co-founders, David and Tom Gardner, famously picked the stock on daytime television back in July of 1998. Had you invested $30,000 back then, it would be worth over a million dollars today."", ""The shares aren't so hot right now, trading near their 52-week low. But the market can be irrational from time to time. Buying good companies when they're unfairly out of favor with Wall Street is a great way to make money over the long term."", 'So what makes Starbucks a magnificent buy today? Here are three reasons.', 'Starbucks began as a regional coffee chain in the Northwest but has grown into a global coffee juggernaut with 38,587 stores worldwide. The company owns and manages its domestic stores but is licensing most of its international stores. Management has stated that the licensing model gives store operators more freedom to innovate (regional beverages, for example) and generates a higher return on investment.', ""Management is leaning further overseas, with international expansion representing 75% of planned store openings in the future. Management's comments about the benefits of licensing sound like good news for Starbucks' long-term growth."", ""Notably, Starbucks believes the world's middle class can grow by 50% by 2030, which plays into Starbucks' hands as an upscale coffee brand. Eventually, the company is targeting 55,000 global stores, a 42% increase from today's footprint."", ""The company generates billions of dollars in free cash flow each year. Management is excellent at making sure profits go back to shareholders. It first began repurchasing shares in 2005. Having fewer shares boosts earnings-per-share (EPS) growth, which played a significant role in the stock's exceptional returns."", ""More recently, Starbucks has begun paying a dividend that it's raised for 13 consecutive years. Since Starbucks' business is more mature, it doesn't need a ton of new investment to grow, meaning that growing cash profits in the future will mostly trickle to shareholders as increasing dividends and more share repurchases."", 'Shareholders can reinvest dividends and let a shrinking share count continue to grow earnings, maximizing long-term investment returns.', ""A brand that people know and love can be monetized repeatedly. Starbucks is a coffee chain at its core, but there are many ways to use its name to create more revenue. For example, Starbucks has steadily waded further into food products at its stores. It's a simple complementary revenue stream totaling $6 billion in 2023."", 'In addition, Starbucks can pull multiple levers for revenue growth, including:', 'Price increases.', 'New products.', 'Bottled beverages sold in retail.', ""Don't forget Starbucks' massive loyalty program, with 75 million members worldwide using it at least once every 90 days. Starbucks has approximately $2.2 billion in deferred revenue through pending gift cards and account deposits. That's like an interest-free loan to the business."", ""The more levers a company can pull, the more durable the growth and the higher the company's ceiling. It doesn't seem bold to state that investors haven't seen Starbucks' ceiling yet."", ""No company's journey is always smooth, but Starbucks has been a winning company and stock for decades. Sometimes, these blue chips get boring, and the market loses interest. Shares are trading near their 52-week low, providing potential buyers with a great opportunity."", ""Starbucks' decline has priced the stock at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23, and while analysts have soured some on long-term growth potential, an average of 15% could still create excellent returns. I love using the PEG ratio, a Peter Lynch favorite, to measure a stock's valuation against its growth potential. At a PEG ratio of 1.5, Starbucks is attractively priced for its expected growth."", ""The stock made millionaires out of everyday investors by steadily expanding and returning profits to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. It doesn't look like that formula is broken, and the stock's valuation means that investors could still enjoy years of lucrative returns."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Starbucks wasn't one of them.

Her experience at Starbucks has prepared her to support Sweetgreen’s ongoing growth strategies. At Starbucks, where she last held the title of EVP and president of North America retail, she oversaw 16,000 stores, helped open thousands of new locations and improved same-store sales.', 'A William Blair report noted that while Williams was EVP and president of North America retail at Starbucks from 2018 to 2022, average weekly sales rose 30% and over 700 new locations opened during that time.', 'She also held several leadership positions, including SVP, global and Americas operations services.

Last August, it hired Michael Kotick as head of marketing and Chad Brauze as head of culinary.', '“Alongside sweetgreen’s founding triad and its long-term CFO, we believe the wider lens of experience afforded by the new hires bodes well for the company’s ability to scale, innovate, and hone its store-level execution—of particular importance as sweetgreen enters a year that will see a wider rollout of Infinite Kitchens,” Sharon Zackfia, analyst at William Blair, said in a report emailed to Restaurant Dive.', 'The chain’s chief development officer left in December. Timothy Noonan, VP of operations, strategy and restaurant concept design, was promoted to SVP, development and took on many of the CDO’s former responsibilities.', 'Sweetgreen, which has over 220 units, expects to open seven to nine Infinite Kitchens this year and two to four retrofits, Neman said during a November earnings call. The company expects to open between 23 and 28 new stores this year, with Infinite Kitchen openings expected to “be weighted towards the back half of the year.”\xa0Retrofits will be completed in stores in high-volume urban locations that will benefit from faster throughput. This move will likely translate into higher revenue and return on capital, Neman\xa0said.', '“We remain focused on expanding our footprint in a capital-efficient manner, to capture the white space and expect to see our real estate pipeline resume on a higher trend line during 2025,” he said.', 'This story was originally published on Restaurant Dive.

Regulators will need to look closely at the proposal which includes multiple carbon-emitting resources, said Maggie Schuppert, campaigns director Clean Up the River Environment, or CURE, a rural social justice nonprofit in the state.', 'Minnesota has set a goal for utilities to supply 100% emissions-free electricity by 2040, and observers say it is not clear how Xcel’s plan will achieve that target.', '“State regulators and the public will have to carefully scrutinize Xcel’s plan ... which inexplicably includes new fossil fuel infrastructure including large gas peaker plants,” Schuppert said. “We’re also dismayed to see that Xcel quietly wants to keep its three so-called ‘waste-to-energy’ plants operating for a decade or more past their planned retirements.”', 'Xcel has three “Refuse Derived Fuel” generating plants slated to close in 2027: the 23-MW Red Wing plant and 20-MW Mankato plant, both in Minnesota, and the 18-MW French Island plant in Wisconsin. The utility has proposed extending their lives to 2037, 2037 and 2040, respectively.', '“These plants not only add significant value to our system and help us achieve our renewable energy goals with reliable power, but also provide value to the local communities they serve,” according to Xcel. The utility said it plans to address the extension of these plants in an upcoming filing.', 'But “garbage is a dirty, inefficient, and carbon intensive fuel source that pollutes surrounding communities,” Schuppert said. “Minnesota should be moving away from burning garbage for energy, not doubling down.”', 'Xcel has made progress decarbonizing its system and says it was the first electric provider in the U.S. to set a vision to deliver all carbon-free electricity.', '“Over the last five-plus years, we’ve put that vision into action by beginning our transition away from coal-fired generation and adding nation-leading amounts of renewable generation to our system. This plan represents the next step,” the company said in a statement.', 'The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has recognized a need for up to 800 MW of new firm dispatchable resources in the near-term to serve our system and maintain a reliable grid, Xcel spokesperson Theo Keith said in an email. Xcel has put forward a suite of options to address this need, “which includes innovative hydrogen-capable natural gas-fired plants in North Dakota and Minnesota and a battery energy storage system in Minnesota, and our new resource plan confirms that need,” he said.', '“In the near term, we believe gas peaking resources are the most effective and affordable way of meeting our need for ‘always-available’ energy,” Keith said. The new combustion turbines “will only run when needed, meaning they’ll have very low emissions, in line with our long-term carbon goals.”', 'Xcel also plans to file a certificate of need this week in Minnesota to support a 20-year extension of its Prairie Island nuclear plant.', 'In August, the Minnesota PUC voted unanimously to allow Xcel to store additional spent nuclear fuel at its Monticello plant, clearing the way for operations there to continue through at least 2040. The plant’s current license allows it to operate until 2030, and Xcel has asked the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a two-decade extension. The NRC will also need to approve an extension of the Prairie Island license.', 'Xcel said its new Upper Midwest energy plan will lean on $5.7 billion in tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act to help reduce the impact on customer bills. It will increase rates in the region by less than 1% annually, or “less than half of the expected national average increase in electricity prices,” Keith said.', 'Keith said Xcel’s average residential customer energy bills “have been below the national average for decades, and our electric bills were 28% below the national average in 2023.”', 'This story was originally published on Utility Dive.

It is a relatively small unit of ADM, a giant in global grains trading which has a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion. Since 2020, however, the division has played a major role in the doling out of executive compensation.', ""A change by ADM's Compensation and Succession Committee in 2020 tied half of long-term executive compensation to the Nutrition segment's operating profit growth, according to ADM's regulatory filings. Previously, long-term compensation had been based on ADM's adjusted earnings, return on invested capital and relative total shareholder returns, the filings showed."", ""ADM's 24% share price plunge was its biggest single-day fall since 1929, according to the Chicago-based Center for Research in Security Prices."", 'The company has since told employees that it will delay bonuses for some senior executives until its financial statements were completed and audited, Reuters reported last week.', '(Reporting by Chris Prentice and Jody Godoy in New YorkEditing by Michelle Price, Caroline Stauffer and Matthew Lewis)']"

The factory in Berlin currently produces about 5,000 cars per week. Meaning the planned halt could potentially result in a reduction of around 10,000 cars for the quarter.

The Red Sea shipping crisis could potentially impact its economy as revenues from the Suez Canal plummet. The country generated $9.4 billion in revenue in 2022, about 2% of its GDP, with nearly a quarter attributed to exports through the canal. Additionally, the Egyptian economy is already facing challenges. The country also heavily relies on foreign currency from the canal to pay for imports like soybeans.

It seems as though these positive trends are continuing in 2024, with many investors remaining faithful to their tech holdings and expecting higher profitability from their investments as the year progresses. With such strong optimism driving up the tech stocks, many are beginning to wonder whether this obsession with tech stocks ever come to an end and whether other names in the market will ever gain investor attention again.', 'On February 1, Mizuho Americas\' Farzin Azarm joined CNBC\'s ""Street Signs Asia"" to discuss current trends in the US tech sector and this investor obsession with tech stocks. Here are some of his comments:', '""Everybody is in the US tech names, everybody, and nobody\'s selling these names because why would they? Every day you come in, NVIDIA\'s making a new all time high, look at what Meta is doing after hours look at what Amazon is doing after hours. It\'s been a safe haven and people are saying \'why should I abandon these names that have given me a return every day? Why should I move away from something like this and invest in something that risky, that hasn\'t given me any kind of a return?\'""', 'According to Azarm, this continued preference for US tech stocks is resulting in other stocks, notably those originating in China, being ignored. He believes that a ""crack"" in the US tech and AI trade is the only thing that will rotate money back into Chinese stocks at the end of the day. He added that because investors have already committed huge amounts to expensive American stocks, they do not have the appetite to invest further in more expensive companies. As such, he believes that when the US tech rally slows down, cheaper valuation Chinese companies may begin to attract investor attention. On this front, here\'s what Azarm had to say:', '""People are looking for underperformance, people are looking for... cheaper valuation companies. The US names are trading at 30-35 times now, some of these names. They\'re priced to perfection.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.', 'For most of 2023, the tech sector seemed to have established itself as a safe haven for many investors with its prolonged rallies, helped by the rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing profitability of several large tech companies. It seems as though these positive trends are continuing in 2024, with many investors remaining faithful to their tech holdings and expecting higher profitability from their investments as the year progresses. With such strong optimism driving up the tech stocks, many are beginning to wonder whether this obsession with tech stocks ever come to an end and whether other names in the market will ever gain investor attention again.', 'On February 1, Mizuho Americas\' Farzin Azarm joined CNBC\'s ""Street Signs Asia"" to discuss current trends in the US tech sector and this investor obsession with tech stocks. Here are some of his comments:', '""Everybody is in the US tech names, everybody, and nobody\'s selling these names because why would they? Every day you come in, NVIDIA\'s making a new all time high, look at what Meta is doing after hours look at what Amazon is doing after hours. It\'s been a safe haven and people are saying \'why should I abandon these names that have given me a return every day? Why should I move away from something like this and invest in something that risky, that hasn\'t given me any kind of a return?\'""', 'According to Azarm, this continued preference for US tech stocks is resulting in other stocks, notably those originating in China, being ignored. He believes that a ""crack"" in the US tech and AI trade is the only thing that will rotate money back into Chinese stocks at the end of the day. He added that because investors have already committed huge amounts to expensive American stocks, they do not have the appetite to invest further in more expensive companies. As such, he believes that when the US tech rally slows down, cheaper valuation Chinese companies may begin to attract investor attention. On this front, here\'s what Azarm had to say:', '""People are looking for underperformance, people are looking for... cheaper valuation companies. The US names are trading at 30-35 times now, some of these names. They\'re priced to perfection. They\'re not going down, it\'s amazing to me, but once it does, and it\'s gonna come, I think that money may go to China.""', 'In light of the above, it is unsurprising that major names such as\xa0Alphabet Inc.

We're always trying to. So, even though we're 96% thereabouts, we're always looking to improve our -- you know, our retailer mix, and you know, obviously that's been beneficial to our NOI growth. I would say, just generically, you know, and obviously I spent a lot of time on my cellphone leasing, and with my team on leasing, demand remains very strong."", ""And there is a real interest by all sorts of retailers and, you know, people that populate our shopping centers to be part of what we're doing. So, I think as you probably saw, our new deals or $74 a foot thereabouts, our renewals are $65 a foot, our expiring leases this year in the 56, 57 range. So, you know, we're seeing generally positive spreads. Supply and demand is in our favor. Historically low supply in big properties across the -- across the country."", ""I mean, there used to be 40 million square feet of retail real estate built every year, now there's essentially, you know, less than a few million here and there. So -- and then, there's been obsolescence too, which makes the supply shrink as well. So -- and, then there's just great new retailers that we're very excited to do business with. I was on the West Coast seeing some of them. The importance of bricks and mortar has never been higher."", ""And, you know, the cost of -- all of the things that we said about -- you know, don't -- don't get me wrong e-commerce is critically important, but -- but all of this stuff about e-commerce, cost of customer acquisition, returns, you know, stickiness, etc., all is -- continues to be a challenge.

And if we think we can deploy that capital into kind of what I'd call the mothership and -- and get better growth from that, then that's where our No. 1 priority will be."", ""So, it wouldn't surprise me, Caitlin, for us to continue to, you know, monetize. Obviously, the -- you know, some of these are, you know, bigger value -- bigger investments. So, it's not, you know -- not easy to, you know, to do it in one big swoop.

On the property level, there's no question that all of the mixed-use stuff that we're bringing in, plus the redevelopment of our department store boxes, are probably the most, you know, interesting and exciting things that we're doing on the ground well. And so, that would certainly be number one. Number two is we're very excited about growing our outlet business in Southeast Asia."", ""It's an incredibly -- it's an incredible -- incredibly robust market, young -- a young population and a growing -- and I'm not -- when I say Southeast Asia, I'm not -- you know, like in Jakarta, places like that where, you know, it's not China; it's -- it's places like that where we -- we see kind of what we can do in Japan and in Korea on the outlet side. Jeff, you're -- you -- you probably know that better than anybody based on your -- your -- your -- your previous history with -- with -- you know, in terms of that. So, we -- that's very exciting. I'd also say we still are in the pursuit of bringing technology to our loyal consumers that allow them to enhance and -- their shopping experience with us. So, we've got a lot of initiatives on the marketing, loyalty. Now, Simon Search is a great example where, you know, our consumer, either in-property or pre-visit, can search our -- our -- our -- our tenant base for what -- if they're looking for a black dress, where in the center can I buy it, at what retailer."", ""Obviously, that ties into the marketplace we're building with premium outlets. There'll be some news there this year on that front. So, that whole -- you know, that whole echo -- that whole system about customer interaction, reinforcing their shopping behavior, rewarding loyalty, expediting their trip, and making it more useful, you know, is -- is a big focus. And then -- and then -- and then, as important, I think this is number four, really, is just we've got to do a great job of continuing to evolve our retailer mix. The -- the exciting thing is, you know, there are more and more entrepreneurs, there are more and more exciting retailers that are coming up with great concepts, proving them out and then -- and then realizing that, you know, our centers are a good place for them to do business.

And sort of, you know, thinking about Jeff's and Steve's questions on reinvestment, as you think about getting back to that pre-pandemic dividend level, given the investment opportunities, especially lack of supply, growing demand, you know, people are once again really engaged in physical retail, does that change your trajectory as you think about getting the dividend back to pre-pandemic? Meaning are there better investment opportunities with that capital, or is the delta really a function of rising interest rates that's, you know -- meaning that the surpassing pre-pandemic NOI versus the dividend is really Just a function of the higher interest expense now?"", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, I mean, Alex, look, our yield is ridiculously hot, OK? So, that's really -- I mean we could financially pay 2 10 tomorrow, right? So, we have 1.5 billion of free cash flow after our dividends. So, it's nothing to do with financial wherewithal. You know, I mean we'd like -- we would like -- you know, we don't like trading at this higher yield. So -- so, I think -- I think that's kind of how we look at it.

David, base minimum rents are up healthily in the low single-digit range year over year, while your tenant sales per square foot are down slightly. So, can you just talk a little bit about these dynamics? Is that a reflection of your rents kind of catching up to some of the strength the tenants have experienced before their sales have started to come down? And just how long are these dynamics kind of sustainable like this? Thank you.', 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure, a good question. So, I will say this, I think the rent -- going into rents, renewals, or new leases are very much sustainable. If you look at our occupancy costs, they're still, you know, at the low end of our historical range and we're at 12.6, and you know, we have run up to 14-plus percent before. And I would also use -- I would also caution, you know -- report -- you know, these are the sales that our tenants are reporting to us, but they are somewhat affected by, you know, returns they get and so on."", ""We actually think our sales per foot are higher than this. Some cases, they have the ability to -- to offset returns, and most cases, they don't. So, I just put that out there. So, I wouldn't -- you know, and I mentioned this maybe two or three years ago, probably certainly pre-pandemic. But we reported, I know the market likes it, we actually think our sales are higher that come from our properties and then there's somewhat affected by returns."", ""And we think some of -- a lot of those returns are internet sales returns. So, they don't even come from our properties. And so, again, when we look at it, we feel like supply and demand, low occupancy cost, high retail sales, and just overall demand will be able to generate kind of the -- the -- the new leasing and renewal spreads that -- that we've seen over the last couple of years."", 'Michael Goldsmith -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure.', 'Operator', ""Thank you.

And just, you know, you've talked a lot about how the leasing environment is good. Just what's the -- the outlook for retaining those boxes today? What's the -- the targeted kind of make-up there? And is luxury still doing enough to be able to be the primary kind of backfill option?"", 'David Simon -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, on the -- on the -- on the -- on -- Craig, on the -- on the department store boxes, I do not have it on top of my head, but the ones we own, we basically are -- don't have a ton of work to do. We have a handful of boxes that we own that -- that are in, you know, process like, for instance -- and I mentioned Brea just briefly on the call, you know, we're -- that was a former Sears store. We tore it down and it's in development now -- under construction now. So, the actual stores that we own are not many, probably under 10 at this point that are either currently under construction or in process. So, you know, very small amount of, you know, kind of, you know -- less of an opportunity than you think."", ""The ones that we transform, co-own -- still owns some boxes. And -- and so, so does [Inaudible] so, you know, we'll -- in our property. So, we'll see how that evolves. I mean, eventually, some of those could be opportunities for us to buy and redevelop."", ""We haven't made deals on those just because bid and the ask has been, you know, too great. But we -- we find -- and I don't -- I don't think luxury is really going to be the dominant theme on a lot of these mixed-use -- or I'm sorry, on these, you know, boxes. I think a lot of it will be -- continue to be the mixed-use development that we're doing. And, you know, and obviously opening up -- if it's an enclosed mall, opening the center up with restaurants and entertainment and so on has worked very well. So, we have -- we have a number under construction or about to be under construction."", ""But we don't really have that existing pipe that -- until we make more deals to buy some of the boxes back. It's not as big as you might think. and it's only a handful. Now, Macy's, you know, right there, they announced some store closings, none of which are ours."", 'So, you know, we\'ll -- we\'re always very focused on knowing exactly where we might be at risk. Though -- and I would point out, very importantly, when Sears went out of business, the whole market said, ""How are you going to survive, you know, Sear\'s is going out of business?"" You know, the 800 department stores at that time. I think, frankly, they\'re down to, believe it or not, operating maybe five, six, seven, eight. I think we actually have the most between us and the Italian portfolio, but how are you going to survive it? The fact of the matter is it was a nonevent to the mall customer. And if anything, as we\'ve gotten those boxes back, we\'ve made the center better.', ""So, as we look -- we don't look at box, you know -- the changes in box as a concern. We view it really more aggressively and progressively as something that will enhance the properties portfolio.

I mentioned that for the third time. But you know, we have a whole wing that's connected to the former Sears department store that we're redeveloping. We'll have some outdoor shops. We're building, you know, a Dick's Sporting Goods."", ""We have a Life Time Fitness resort and then we'll do roughly 300 -- 350 apartments or so.

So, that's, by and large all, of this stuff in the U.K. that we've listed, and I don't -- I don't believe is in there."", ""If it is, it just -- it'll be in there shortly.

I mean is there any like -- for just in terms of, you know the -- I guess the 1.3 billion that's active today, plus the 800 million you're going to start, I mean what's a fair assumption for '25, '26 in terms of level of maybe spend stabilizing? I mean at the lowest, how we model it. Like, is 500 million stabilizing annually, you know, let's call it 7%, 8% yield, a fair assumption?

If you don't include what I saw ground-up, new development, I would say probably about between 600 million and 800 million a year.

I'll just give you some thoughts off the top of my head, and then Brian, hopefully, will correct me.

And I was just happy to look at this for -- you know, I must have been probably doing my job, but -- but I noticed in Q4, Q4 as an example of the bounce-back, Woodbury Q4 sales were around $350 million, OK, which to me is a real good indicator of bounce-back and, obviously, the highest fourth-quarter sales we've had there in -- you know, in quite some time. So, I'd say, generally, we're seeing a – a -- a really good bounce-back in the tourist centers. You know, I don't think we're -- you know, the one area that -- you know, the US overall and obviously we'll, you know -- we'll -- we'll -- will, you know, have an impact on us. I do not think we'll see the Chinese -- we do not expect the Chinese to come back, you know, the way they have -- had before pandemic."", ""And -- and our -- our -- and just our tourist centers did outpace our sales for the portfolio for '23 on average. So, good -- good bounce-back across the board. And then, I would say on your -- on your variable rent, we continue to see that as a lower percent of revenues, both you know -- the vast majority, I think we -- we increased our -- you know, the way to think about it -- that's interesting is and again, hopefully, Brian won't need to correct me, but Brian's available to correct me. Our domestic operations had $0.28 of improvement Q over Q, that's $0.28 And within that $0.28, our variable income went down. So, I think that gives you a kind of a leading barometer."", ""We're still working that way down, and we're -- we're getting that into kind of our -- our base rent.

Investors will be pleased to see that HCA Healthcare's stock price has increased by 33% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield."", ' See our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare ', ""Even a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end.

This suggests that the dividend might not be the most reliable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.40 in 2018 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.64. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious."", 'Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. HCA Healthcare has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 12% per annum. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.', 'In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.', ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

The chart below reveals the significance of the Middle East and Asia segments for the company.', 'As a reminder, the company sold its OneStim fracking business to Liberty Oil Services in late 2020, reducing its North American business.', 'For 2023, revenue was $33.13 billion, a multiyear record as shown below.', 'The company indicated substantial international growth, wguke North American expansion fueled strong full-year performance.', 'CEO Olivier Le Peuch said in the conference call:', '""The fourth quarter was an impressive conclusion to the year\'s financial results. We grew revenue both sequentially and year-on-year, and we achieved cycle-high margins and cash flows during the quarter. Our strong performance was fueled by the international and offshore markets and was supported by robust sales in digital and integration of the acquired Aker subsea business.""', 'Thanks to increased working capital and strong cash flow, SLB bought back 1.80 million shares in the fourth quarter.', 'Finally, the company is raising its quarterly dividend to 27.50 cents per share, which is still insufficient when compared to oil supermajors.', 'Oilfield services companies have observed a decrease in activity in 2024. However, capital expenditure is expected to remain constant year over year. Most oil producers are focused on maintaining their production levels.', 'On the other hand, larger companies are using their cash flow to acquire producing assets, pay dividends and buy back shares, leaving less for spending.', ""Due to reduced funding, SLB's growth will be impacted, leading to a possible slight decline in the oilfield service industry's performance in 2024 and a more significant decline in 2025."", 'Le Peuch said during the conference call:', '""Looking across this wide baseload of activity, a significant portion is taking place offshore, while capital expenditure will continue their growth momentum in 2024. As a result, the rig count will continue to rise, mainly in the Middle East and Asia, responding to a strong FID pipeline in both shallow and deepwater. All in all, we see the potential for more than $100 billion in global offshore FIDs in both 2024 and 2025, underscoring the enduring strength of the offshore markets and supporting a very favorable subsea outlook for years to come.""', 'One advantage SLB has is that the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Africa benefit from long-cycle developments, capacity expansions and exploration, which may decline in North America in 202425.', ""The company's service relies solely on oil and gas producers, so the capital expenditure outlook is paramount."", 'In December, OPEC declared it would reduce production, which might not be reliable or effective. However, the decision to cut output indicates that OPEC will not attempt to increase production in 2024. Recently, Saudi Aramco (SAU:2222) decided to halt previously planned oil production growth. As Offshore Technology reported: ', '""State-owned Saudi Aramco has been directed by the government of Saudi Arabia to stop its oil expansion plan and focus on a maximum sustained oil production capacity of 12 million barrels per day.""', 'This trend will relieve pressure on U.S. shale producers, which will be inclined to reduce capital spending. Thus, I do not see how the oilfield services could repeat what has been done in 2023 and break out from a bearish descending channel.', ""SLB's stock has been declining since September and October 2023 and is currently down over 5% year over year."", 'This trend is not unique to Schlumberger, as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) have also experienced a similar pattern. All three companies peaked around October 2023 and have been slowly declining, with occasional short-term uptrends. This pattern is concerning and suggests the oilfield services industry may struggle this year.', 'The company reported revenue of $8.99 billion for the fourth quarter, a 14% increase year over year and up 8% from the previous quarter. Net income was $1.11 billion, or 77 cents per diluted share, compared with $1.06 billion, or 74 cents per share. The chart below highlights the steady recovery that has taken place since 2021.', 'During the conference call, Chief Financial Officer Stephane Biguet said, ""Our full-year 2023 revenue of $33.1 million grew 18% year on year. While this revenue is roughly the same as the pre-pandemic level 2019, our adjusted Ebitda in 2023 in absolute dollars was 22% higher.""', 'The sales showed sequential growth owing to the international business. However, as depicted in the graph below, the quarter-over-quarter revenue for the North American segment was a bit low due to decreased activities in the U.S. and Canada. Nevertheless, the Gulf of Mexico offshore performed well.', 'Europe and Africa and the Middle East and Asia regions generate the highest revenue. Only 19.8% of the total comes from North America.', 'The company divides its revenue into four main segments, primarily focusing on well construction and production systems.', 'SLB reported that Well Construction remained stable sequentially as international growth offset a decline in North America.', 'The company recorded free cash flow of $2.39 billion. The generic definition of free cash flow is the cash generated from operating activities after deducting capital expenditures. However, SLB reported a different figure of $2.28 billion for its free cash flow. This is because investments in APS projects were added to its capital expenditures of $626 million.', 'Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $4.54 billion, while quarterly free cash flow increased to $2.39 billion from $1.02 billion a year ago.', 'While net debt decreased sequentially to $7.98 billion, the total debt, including current debt, was $11.96 billion. This figure shows a decrease from the $12.23 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The cash balance was $3.98 billion.', 'The net debt also saw a significant reduction to $7.97 billion. Although the debt-to-equity ratio is still high at 0.59 (it should be reduced to below 0.40), the company has made impressive progress in reducing debt, which is a positive sign. Overall, I am pleased with the progress that should continue in 2024.', 'During the conference call, Biguet said:', '""Looking ahead to the full year of 2024. We expect continued margin expansion in our core, driven by sustained operating leverage, a favorable geographic mix and pricing tailwinds. In our Digital and Integration division, we expect margins to remain approximately at the same level as 2023 as digital margins will increase due to the accelerated adoption of our new technology platforms, while APS margins will decrease as a result of higher amortization expenses.""', 'Please note the chart has been adjusted to include dividends.', 'SLB develops a descending channel pattern, with support at $52.20 and resistance at $47.90. The relative strength index of 60 indicates we are approaching a fast, overbought situation.', 'Descending channel patterns are mostly bearish in the short term as the stock moves lower within a descending channel. However, these common patterns often form within longer-term uptrends and are considered continuation patterns.', 'It is expected that prices will increase after following a descending channel pattern. However, this will only happen if the upper trend line is penetrated. Since Jan. 16, there has been a turnaround in SLB, and it is now on its way to testing the resistance level again.', 'Although it is still being determined if there will be enough momentum to break out this time, it remains a possibility, but only if oil prices experience a sudden boost. Otherwise, it will be difficult.', 'Based on my investment strategy, selling around 50% of your short-term last in, first out position is advisable. If there is strong momentum, selling within the $53 to $54.80 range would be reasonable, with a possibility of higher resistance at $56.50. However, if the stock price falls between $47.50 and $48.80, it would be wise to add to your position, with a possible lower support level at $45.20', 'Utilizing the LIFO strategy can be an effective approach to trading your long-term core position. It means you hold onto your oldest position while selling off your most recent purchases. This strategy can significantly reduce your risk while offering higher profit potential.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward.

Slower revenue and subscriber growth caused the shares to tank 51% in 2022.', 'But investors have sat back, relaxed, and pressed fast-forward. Now this top streaming stock is up 91% since the start of 2023 (as of Feb. 2). Credit goes to remarkable momentum with the underlying business.', 'Should you buy Netflix shares now?', ""Netflix blew past estimates in the fourth quarter of last year. The business added 13.1 million net new members, helping push revenue up 12.5% year over year to $8.8 billion. This was the most customers Netflix was able to sign up in a fourth quarter ever. And it means the subscriber base expanded by an impressive 29.5 million in 2023, returning to Netflix's typical rate of roughly 25 million to 30 million additions per year."", ""Management called out success in the company's efforts to crack down on password sharing as a driver of the strong growth. And Netflix is benefiting from huge demand for the cheaper ad-supported subscription tier. Membership was up 70% on a sequential basis."", ""Even in the more mature U.S. and Canada markets, Netflix's customer base grew. The business raised its prices once again in the important U.S. market late last year, which helped propel a 3% gain in average revenue per user. The fact that Netflix's churn rate, at 2% in December, is consistently well below that of its peers indicates that customers still find huge value in the service. This means there could be untapped pricing power going forward."", ""Taking our attention away from the latest quarter and zooming out a bit, it's not hard to understand just how dominant Netflix has become. It appears to be winning the streaming wars by a wide margin right now."", ""By having a first-mover's advantage in the industry, Netflix was able to scale up rapidly during the 2010s when competition was limited. Now with 260.3 million subscribers and annual revenue of $33.7 billion, the business has the ability to spend a planned $17 billion on content this year, which is likely more than any other rival. "", 'At the same time, Netflix is able to generate impressive profitability. Executives raised the outlook in 2024, and are now expecting an operating margin of 24% for the full year. This figure would be a massive increase from 13% in 2019.', ""One of Netflix's most formidable opponents, Walt Disney, reported an operating loss of $420 million in its direct-to-consumer operations, which includes Disney+, in the 2023 fiscal fourth quarter. It continues to be an uphill battle to get to positive profits."", ""Because the shares have been going parabolic for nearly two years, they are trading at a richer valuation. The current price-to-earnings ratio sits at 47. On a forward basis, it's at 33.1 thanks to the earnings base, which is quickly rising. Nonetheless, some investors might be hesitant to get in at these levels."", ""Yes, the valuation is far more expensive than it was about 21 or so months ago. But the company is also firing on all cylinders right now. It's the leader in the industry, it still has huge growth potential, and it is seeing profitability expand."", 'Investors who have a long-term mindset should consider starting a position in Netflix today.

The ratio gauges a company’s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — the working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.', 'Quick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio — the ‘acid-test ratio’ or ‘quick assets ratio’ — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding the current assets relative to current liabilities. A quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable, like the current ratio.', 'Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet existing debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.', 'A ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company’s financial condition.', 'To pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization — a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency — as one of the screening criteria.

The company added 13.12 million paid subscribers globally in fourth-quarter 2023, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general. Netflix is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio and heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content. Stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+ is a headwind.

The renewable energy company announced its fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25, and while management reiterated its dividend growth goal through 2026, interest rates significantly influence the company's growth. Based on Monday morning's macroeconomic updates, investors in NextEra Energy Partners may have to temper their expectations for now."", 'NextEra Energy Partners stock lost nearly 57% value in 2023, and the company slashed its dividend growth target through 2026 by nearly half to a range of 5% to 8% per year, with an annualized target of 6%. Management blamed a tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates.', 'NextEra Energy Partners typically relies on low-cost funding options like convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF) to fund its growth and dividends. But with interest rates rising last year and its stock price falling simultaneously, it became costlier for the company to buy out CEPFs, making its prior dividend growth target range of 12% to 15% unsustainable.', ""It's easy to understand why interest rates are so important for NextEra Energy Partners. Although it is already working on its transition plan for growth, particularly the repowering of nearly 1.3 gigawatts of wind assets through 2026, it still will need interest rates to fall for it to be able to fund new growth and support dividends comfortably. With the Federal Reserve hinting in December that it would cut the federal funds rate multiple times in 2024, investors in NextEra Energy Partners turned hopeful."", ""However, a rate cut in March is looking unlikely now, or at least that's what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during an interview on CBS's 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday. Not surprisingly, shares of companies with businesses that are highly sensitive to interest rates are falling Monday."", ""While it's true that NextEra Energy Partners could thrive in a low-interest-rate environment, the company's transition plan to support annual dividend growth of 5% to 8% is on track. Last month, management confirmed that dividend objective and said the company should be able to grow its dividend by 6% in 2024 without an acquisition."", ""With NextEra Energy Partners projecting cash available for distribution in the range of $730 million to $820 million for 2024, compared to $689 million in 2023, the company should be able to navigate the year and grow its dividend even if interest rates don't fall as swiftly as expected.

While planned US capacity additions mean domestic sourcing requirements may be met solely through US production over time, the decision to reflect a daily assessment on a delivered-duty-paid basis considers feedback that project delays could cause the US to rely on sourcing from other countries, particularly FTA (free trade agreement) members.', 'The Platts US lithium carbonate DDP assessments reflect standard battery grade quality; minimum of 99.5% Li2CO3, of five metric tons, powder packed in bags, delivered 15 to 60 days forward, expressed in US dollars per metric ton.

Ratings’ revenues are differentiated between transaction and non-transaction revenues.Market Intelligence (34%): It helps investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities to track performance, generate alpha, identify investment ideas, understand competitive and industry dynamics, perform evaluations and assess credit risk. Desktop, Data Management Solutions and Risk Services are the business lines included in the segment.Commodity Insights (15%): Commodity Insights provides information and benchmark prices for commodity and energy markets. It helps producers, traders, energy and commodity market intermediaries with price data, analytics and industry insights, thereby enhancing transparency and efficiency in the market.Indices (12%): Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.

As you may have seen in our press release this morning, fiscal 2024 is off to a good start with solid performance in Q1 giving us confidence in our full-year outlook. The momentum we established in the back half of last year continued in Q1, highlighted by a $175 million improvement in adjusted operating income, a 130 basis points of AOI margin expansion and near doubling of adjusted EPS, all on a sequential basis. As we begin fiscal '24, we're witnessing the benefits of our core multi-protein portfolio.

While we can't control the macro environment, our focus on what we can control has been evident in Q1."", ""Our performance reflects a commitment to operational excellence, we are more agile, collaborative, and disciplined business than a year ago, and we have a long runway of opportunities in front of us.

Our brands resonate with consumers, and we're maintaining strong market share despite comparing to our record position last year and some overall category consumption softness in Q1. We will continue to support our brands through innovation, marketing, and strong customer partnerships while meeting consumers where they are. I remain highly confident in our long-term strategy based on a broad portfolio of core proteins and strong brands and I'm optimistic about our future."", ""We're leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let's delve into an update on share position of our branded portfolio. Our Q1 pound share in our core business lines, which include product lines from our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, State Fair, Aidells, and Ball Park, remains at historically high levels despite a modest decline compared to record share in Q1 last year. In fact, our core business lines have grown pound share by more than 400 basis points since Q1 of 2019. While inflation is easing, consumers are still facing high prices compared to two years ago. However, they are still willing to purchase brands they know and trust, and this is reflected in our share. We're also focused on customer elasticity and balancing with our own cost."", 'We believe our approach is working. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonate strongly with consumers. Over the past year, nearly three out of four US households purchased a Tyson core business line product, and this penetration rate is growing. What gets me even more excited is that our product line with the highest penetration rate is only in about a third of households, leaving us plenty of room for continued growth over the long run. Moving on to segment performance, starting with Prepared Foods. Our foodservice volumes continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification and margin accretive channels. Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove strong adjusted operating profits and margins.', ""Our Branded Foods business remains a strategic growth pillar, and we are committed to supporting and growing our brands through innovation, price pack architecture, high ROI marketing support and strong customer partnerships. This is critically important in an economic environment where consumers remain more discerning with their purchasing decisions. In Chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal '23 continued in Q1 with a third consecutive quarter of over $100 million in sequential AOI increase. Operational improvements, including the bold actions we've taken along with improvements in live operations, yield, labor efficiency, and customer service, as well as improving market conditions, were the primary drivers in Q1. In Beef, limited cattle supply led to spread compression as we expected."", ""Roughly half the loss in Q1 was related to an inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily driven by highly volatile cattle futures. While spreads are expected to remain tight, our goal remains to be best-in-class operators so that we can manage the business as efficiently as possible. We have identified incremental opportunities to improve our execution and help offset some of the challenges from the current cattle cycle. Turning to Pork, better supply drove lower hog cost leading to improving spreads. Our team's focus on operational execution allowed us to capture the benefits of these favorable market dynamics, which resulted in improved profits both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before I hand it over to John for a financial review, let's reiterate our priorities for the year."", ""First, we're committed to improving our financial strength and driving cash flow to support our dividend, as demonstrated in Q1. Over the past year, we announced the closure of six of our older, less-efficient plants in chicken and two of our smaller beef case-ready value-added facilities. We're already seeing the benefits of these actions and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to drive efficiency across our segments. In Chicken, our focus on enhancing our competitiveness continues. In Prepared Foods, we want to build growth momentum behind capacity additions coming online, increase our brand household penetration, and diversify and grow our foodservice business. In Beef, we acknowledge the challenges and will be prepared for multiple outcomes during the current cattle cycle."", ""In Pork, we're gaining momentum in operational execution and are excited for continued improvements. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results and outlook."", ""John R. Tyson: Thanks, Donnie. I'll start with an overview of our total company results before moving on to our individual segments. Sales in Q1 grew slightly year-over-year as an increase in Beef revenue was nearly offset by a decrease in Chicken. The decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in Beef, which was partially offset by growth in Chicken and Pork. It's important to note that AOI improved significantly on a sequential basis despite the modest decline versus last year. Adjusted EPS nearly doubled compared to last quarter, highlighting the ongoing improvement in our operational performance. Now, let's review our segment results starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q1 revenue was flat year-over-year."", 'Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition and continued recovery in our foodservice business. Lower pricing primarily reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q1 was also in-line with last year. Lower raw material costs and operational efficiencies were offset by increased brand support expenses, start-up costs associated with new capacity additions and mix. AOI dollars and margin both increased significantly on a sequential basis due to strong operational performance and great seasonal execution by the team. Moving on to Chicken. Sales in Q1 declined 5.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of lower commodity protein prices. Volume declined 1.5% due to lower production, which was partially offset by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory.', 'Despite the decline in sales versus last year, AOI more than doubled in Q1, primarily driven by the benefits of our strategic actions and other operational efficiencies. These include lower plant spend, improved yield and better live performance. While input costs were a clear tailwind, these were largely offset by the impact of lower pricing. As Donnie mentioned, this is the third consecutive quarter of more than $100 million of AOI improvement as we were able to pull forward the benefits of closures of inefficient plants in improvements in our live operations. Now moving to Beef. In Beef, revenue increased 6.4% year-over-year in Q1, with lower head throughput more than offset by higher prices per pound. While revenue increased, AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads, as was expected.', 'As Donnie mentioned, in Q1, nearly half of the operating loss was driven by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily due to the rapid and significant decline in cattle futures. Moving to Pork, Q1 revenue was down modestly as volume growth was offset by lower pricing. However, AOI increased year-over-year, benefiting primarily from improved spreads driven by lower hog cost as well as better execution. And finally, a brief comment on our International business. AOI improved as we begin to lap some of the start-up cost of our newer facilities and continue to focus on improving execution despite a decline in sales, driven by macroeconomic challenges. Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Our commitment to building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders, primarily via our dividend, remains unwavering.', ""While market conditions remain challenging, we are laser-focused on disciplined management and deployment our capital resources to drive cash flow. Q1 showcased robust operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, above our expectations, and working capital was a solid source of cash as we continued to manage inventory levels. We were also disciplined with CapEx, which came in at just over $350 million in the quarter, below last year's exit rate. During the quarter, we returned $171 million to shareholders via dividends. Our net leverage declined sequentially, coming below 4 times, driven by our improved profitability and strong cash generation. We ended Q1 with more than $3.7 billion of liquidity. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged."", ""We are committed to building financial strength and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, and returning net leverage to at or below 2 times net debt to EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now, let's take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. Given the solid results in Q1, we have confidence that our financial performance in 2024 will improve versus last year. However, as it's still early in the new fiscal year and uncertainties remain, especially in our Beef segment, we have made only modest changes to our outlook. Our focus for fiscal 2024 remains to manage the business for profit and cash dollar generation, reflected in our guidance presented in dollar terms rather than margin percentages."", ""With that in mind, we are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year-over-year. Moving to each of the segments. Prepared Foods had a solid start in a seasonally strong period. For the remainder of the year, we expect strong volume results as we continue our momentum in foodservice and see the benefits of our capacity additions. We remain focused on operational efficiencies while we support our brands and anticipate continued start-up costs. Taking all this into account, we're maintaining our AOI guidance to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. In Chicken, our operational turnaround is progressing as anticipated. For the remainder of the year, we expect to return to normal seasonality where Q2 is typically a weaker quarter."", ""Given the strong start in Q1 and that we believe that there were more tailwinds than headwinds, we are tightening our AOI guidance range to be between $500 million and $700 million. In Beef, spreads are compressing as expected. However, uncertainty remains around how the cattle cycle will progress. Therefore, we are maintaining our full-year guidance at a loss of $400 million to breakeven. In Pork, on the back of our strong Q1 results, we're now raising our guidance to be between breakeven and $100 million. For the total company AOI, we're maintaining our guidance of between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, reflecting the portfolio nature of our segments. To round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million, and a tax rate to now be between 23% and 24%."", ""Turning to CapEx, we're maintaining tight controls on spending in-line with profitability and cash flow, and we expect CapEx to remain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion this year. Finally, on free cash flow, we're committed to managing working capital and CapEx, and we're even more confident now than we were last quarter that we will generate positive free cash flow for the year. To further help model the shape of the rest of the year, we anticipate more typical seasonality across our business. As a reminder, Q2 is seasonally our weakest quarter for AOI and cash flow, driven by Beef and Chicken. As you may be aware, this January has already been impacted by severe winter weather disrupting operations. And again, we expect start-up costs in Prepared Foods to impact Q2 as well."", ""So, in summary, 2024 is off to a promising start and we're cautiously optimistic on our prospects for the remainder of the year as well as for the long term. Tyson is a leader in the global protein industry. We have strong brands, a broad portfolio of products and a great team, all of which uniquely position us to win in the market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions."", 'Sean Cornett: Thanks, John. We will now move on to your questions.

King', ""Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, fiscal 2024 is off to a good start with solid performance in Q1, giving us confidence in our full year outlook. The momentum we established in the back half of last year continued in Q1, highlighted by $175 million improvement in adjusted operating income. 130 basis points of AOI margin expansion and near doubling of adjusted EPS, all on a sequential basis.As we begin fiscal '24, we're witnessing the benefits of our core multi-protein portfolio. Chicken and pork are offsetting beef headwinds while Prepared Foods continues to generate strong profit dollars and margins. While we can't control the macro environment, our focus on what we can control has been evident in Q1. Our performance reflects a commitment to operational excellence. We are more agile, collaborative and disciplined business than a year ago, and we have a long runway of opportunities in front of us. I'm proud of our team members' continued efforts to enhance operational performance and want to thank all of them for their high level of engagement and their part in delivering our results in this quarter. We're controlling what we can to drive cash flow as well. Our disciplined approach to CapEx and working capital helped generate strong cash flow in the quarter.Prudent cash deployment as part of our strategy to build financial strength and will position us well when market dynamics turn in our favor. You've seen us take bold actions to improve performance, and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence and address inefficiencies. Our plan is working, and we're seeing tangible benefits of our efforts as evidenced by improvements in chicken and pork. While I'm pleased by the performance in Q1, we still have more work ahead of us and we're cautiously optimistic and laser-focused on achieving what we set out to do this year. Our brands resonate with consumers, and we're maintaining strong market share despite comparing to our record position last year and some overall category consumption softness in Q1. We will continue to support our brands through innovation, marketing and strong customer partnerships while meeting consumers where they are. I remain highly confident in our long-term strategy based on a broad portfolio of core proteins and strong brands and I'm optimistic about our future.We're leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Now let's delve into an update on share position of our branded portfolio. Our Q1 Pound share in our core business lines, which include product lines from our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, State Fair, Aidells and Ball Park, remains at historically high levels despite a modest decline compared to record share in Q1 last year. In fact, our core business lines have grown Pound share by more than 400 basis points since Q1 of 2019. While inflation is easy, consumers are still facing high prices compared to 2 years ago. However, they are still willing to purchase brands they know and trust, and this is reflected in our share. We're also focused on customer elasticity and balancing with our own costs. We believe our approach is working. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonate strongly with consumers.Over the past year, nearly 3 out of 4 U.S. households purchased a Tyson Core business line product, and this penetration rate is growing. What gets me even more excited is that our product line with the highest penetration rate is only in about 1/3 of households, leaving us plenty of room for continued growth over the long run.Moving on to segment performance, starting with Prepared Foods. Our Food Service volumes continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification and margin-accretive channels. Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove strong adjusted operating profits and margins. Our branded foods business remains a strategic growth pillar, and we are committed to supporting and growing our brands through innovation, price pack architecture, high ROI marketing support and strong customer partnerships. This is critically important in an economic environment where consumers remain more discerning with their purchasing decisions.In chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal '23 continued in Q1 with a third consecutive quarter of over $100 million in sequential AOI increase. Operational improvements, including the bold actions we've taken, along with improvements in live operations, yield, labor efficiency and customer service, as well as improving market conditions were the primary drivers in Q1. In beef, limited cattle supply led to spread compression as we expected. Roughly half the loss in Q1 was related to an inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily driven by highly volatile cattle futures. While spreads are expected to remain tight, our goal remains to be best-in-class operators so that we can manage the business as efficiently as possible. We have identified incremental opportunities to improve our execution and help offset some of the challenges from the current cattle cycle.Turning to pork. Better supply drove lower hog costs, leading to improving spreads. Our team's focus on operational execution allowed us to capture the benefit of these favorable market dynamics which resulted in improved profits both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before I hand it over to John for a financial review, let's reiterate our priorities for the year. First, we're committed to improving our financial strength and driving cash flow to support our dividend, as demonstrated in Q1. Over the past year, we announced the closure of 6 of our older, less efficient plants in chicken and 2 of our smaller beef, case-ready value-added facilities. We are already seeing the benefits of these actions, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to drive efficiency across our segments.In chicken, our focus on enhancing our competitiveness continues. In Prepared Foods, we want to build growth momentum behind capacity additions coming online, increase our brand household penetration and diversify and grow our foodservice business. In beef, we acknowledge the challenges and will be prepared for multiple outcomes during the current cattle cycle. In pork, we're gaining momentum in operational execution and are excited for continued improvements. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results and outlook."", 'John R. Tyson', ""Thanks, Donnie. I'll start with an overview of our total company results before moving on to our individual segments. Sales in Q1 grew slightly year-over-year as an increase in beef revenue was nearly offset by a decrease in chicken. The decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in beef, which was partially offset by growth in chicken and pork. It's important to note that AOI improved significantly on a sequential basis despite the modest decline versus last year. Adjusted EPS nearly doubled compared to last quarter, highlighting the ongoing improvement in our operational performance.Now let's review our segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q1 revenue was flat year-over-year. Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition and continued recovery in our Foodservice business. Lower pricing primarily reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q1 was also in line with last year. Lower raw material cost and operational efficiencies were offset by increased brand support expenses, start-up costs associated with new capacity additions and mix. AOI dollars and margin both increased significantly on a sequential basis due to strong operational performance and great seasonal execution by the team.Moving on to chicken. Sales in Q1 declined 5.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of lower commodity protein prices. Volume declined 1.5% due to lower production, which was partially offset by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory. Despite the decline in sales versus last year, AOI more than doubled in Q1, primarily driven by the benefits of our strategic actions and other operational efficiencies. These include lower plant spend, improved yield and better live performance.While input costs were clear tailwind, these were largely offset by the impact of lower pricing. As Donnie mentioned, this is the third consecutive quarter of more than $100 million of AOI improvement as we were able to pull forward the benefits of closures of inefficient plants and improvements in our live operations.Now moving to beef. In beef, revenue increased 6.4% year-over-year in Q1 with lower head throughput more than offset by higher prices per pound. While revenue increased, AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads as was expected. As Donnie mentioned, in Q1, nearly half of the operating loss was driven by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily due to the rapid and significant decline in cattle futures. Moving to pork. Q1 revenue was down modestly as volume growth was offset by lower pricing. However, AOI increased year-over-year, benefiting primarily from improved spreads driven by lower hog costs as well as better execution. And finally, a brief comment on our international business. AOI improved as we begin to lap some of the start-up costs of our newer facilities and continue to focus on improving execution despite a decline in sales driven by macroeconomic challenges.Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Our commitment to building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders primarily via our dividend remains unwavering. While market conditions remain challenging, we are laser-focused on disciplined management and deployment of our capital resources to drive cash flow. Q1 showcased a robust operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, above our expectations, and working capital was a solid source of cash as we continue to manage inventory levels. We were also disciplined with CapEx, which came in at just over $350 million in the quarter, below last year's exit rate. During the quarter, we returned $171 million to shareholders via dividends. Our net leverage declined sequentially, coming below 4x, driven by our improved profitability and strong cash generation. We ended Q1 with more than $3.7 billion of liquidity. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged. We are committed to building financial strength and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning net leverage to at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA.We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now let's take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. Given the solid results in Q1, we have confidence that our financial performance in 2024 will improve versus last year. However, as it's still early in the new fiscal year and uncertainties remain, especially in our Beef segment, we have made only modest changes to our outlook. Our focus for fiscal 2024 remains to manage the business for profit and cash dollar generation, reflected in our guidance presented in dollar terms rather than margin percentages. With that in mind, we are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year-over-year.Moving to each of the segments. Prepared Foods had a solid start and a seasonally strong period. For the remainder of the year, we expect strong volume results as we continue our momentum in Foodservice and see the benefits of our capacity additions. We remain focused on operational efficiencies while we support our brands and anticipate continued start-up costs. Taking all this into account, we're maintaining our AOI guidance to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. In chicken, our operational turnaround is progressing as anticipated. For the remainder of the year, we expect to return to normal seasonality where Q2 is typically a weaker quarter. Given the strong start in Q1 and that we believe that there are more tailwinds than headwinds, we are tightening our AOI guidance range to be between $500 million and $700 million.In beef, spreads are compressing as expected. However, uncertainty remains around how the cattle cycle will progress. Therefore, we are maintaining our full year guidance at a loss of $400 million to breakeven. In pork, on the back of our strong Q1 results, we're now raising our guidance to be between breakeven and $100 million. For the total company AOI, we're maintaining our guidance of between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, reflecting the portfolio nature of our segments. To round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million and a tax rate to now be between 23% and 24%.Turning to CapEx. We're maintaining tight controls on spending in line with profitability and cash flow and we expect CapEx to remain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion this year. Finally, on free cash flow, we're committed to managing working capital and CapEx, and we're even more confident now than we were last quarter that we will generate positive free cash flow for the year. To further help model the shape of the rest of the year, we anticipate more typical seasonality across our business. As a reminder, Q2 is seasonally our weakest quarter for AOI and cash flow driven by beef and chicken. And as you may be aware, this January has already been impacted by severe winter weather disrupting operations. And again, we expect start-up costs in Prepared Foods to impact Q2 as well.So in summary, 2024 is off to a promising start, and we're cautiously optimistic on our prospects for the remainder of the year as well as for the long term. Tyson is a leader in the global protein industry. We have strong brands, a broad portfolio of products and a great team, all of which uniquely position us to win in the market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions."", 'Sean T. Cornett', 'Thanks, John. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.', 'Peter Thomas Galbo', ""Donnie, I was just wondering if you could give kind of maybe a brief state of the union. I know you gave some in your prepared remarks but across the segments. And then maybe specifically, if you could start on prepared foods where unlike a lot of CPG peers, you're showing actual volume growth, some of that may be acquired. But just some of the dynamics around food service there seem to be a pretty important driver. So if you can unpack that for us would be great."", 'Donnie D. King', ""Sure. Thanks, Peter. I'll start off and then maybe I'll have others to weigh in. Let me start off just kind of the state of the union. We had a solid first quarter and we continue to build on the momentum with back half of 2023. We are seeing the benefits of our portfolio for chicken and pork, improvements are offsetting challenges in beef and where our Prepared Foods continues to deliver strong results. We continue to restore performance in our Chicken business. As I said earlier, this was our third consecutive quarter of $100 million of AOI improvement and this -- our chicken business remains a top priority of mine.We're managing beef through the volatility and spread tightening of the cycle. We're making great progress in driving out the inefficiency all across the supply chain in pork. Prepared Food is performing to plan. While we have seen softness in the retail channel, our brands have performed well. Core branch share remains near record levels, and we're regaining share in our Foodservice business. and I'll talk more about that in a moment. We're cautiously optimistic about FY '24. We have considered our better-than-expected results in this quarter. We've considered our initiatives to improve performance while also still accounting for the ongoing macro uncertainty. As John said in his opening statements, Q2 is seasonally weaker and our Q2 started off with -- has started off with several significant weather events. But having said all of that, taken together, it's still early in the year, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We have lots of work ahead of us, and we're leaving no stone unturned.We're focused on CapEx and working capital to drive cash flow and support our dividend. We are controlling the controllables and taking necessary actions, including rightsizing and modernizing our footprint and network design to drive efficiencies. We are pleased with the quarter and believe we're taking the right steps. We are excited about our future and are focused on creating value for our shareholders. Specifically or a little bit more specifically in terms of prepared foods to your question, Peter. we had in the quarter, we had strong top and bottom line performance in the quarter with meaningful sequential improvement versus Q4 '23. If you look at the makeup of the volume, it was driven by a balanced portfolio between retail and Foodservice. We're regaining some share loss in the middle of the pandemic that we couldn't support, and we also had the acquisition from a volume standpoint of Williams sausage.Our branded core business line remained a key focus and we have a competitive advantage with volume share near record levels and 400 basis points above Q1 '19. Let me stop with that. Melanie, anything you would add to what I've said."", 'Melanie Boulden', ""Yes, Donnie, I think you did a great job hitting the highlights. The only thing I'll add for you, Peter, is, as Donnie said, our Foodservice performance was strong, and I believe you asked about this question. Our growth this quarter was up 3%, and that was due to customer expansion. Look, as this channel is rebounding, it continues to be an important part of our portfolio that we are focused on because we want to be where our consumers are at and so we're diversifying our customer base. We're building digital capabilities to drive demand, and we are focused on profitable growth."", 'Peter Thomas Galbo', ""Great. And then just maybe quickly as a follow-up on beef. Donnie, look, the cattle inventory report out last week, it seems like maybe we're nearing a bottom or seeing potentially some improvement. But just what's the conversation like with ranchers at this point? Like what's it going to take to get them to actually start heifer retention process? Because I think that remains kind of the biggest linchpin in the whole chain, and it doesn't seem like we have a lot of clarity there yet."", 'Donnie D. King', ""Sure. I mean, I'll tell you, we look at the same information that I'm sure you've seen, and we saw the cattle and feed report that you referenced. Unfortunately, Peter, the data doesn't indicate that heifer retention is taking place. And that's obviously one of the signposts we're looking for. In the quarter, we continue to see volatility in spread tightening -- we expected that. As we think about our outlook, we continue to project high cattle supplies for the balance of '24 and even beyond. And let me pause, Brady, do you want to add anything to that?"", 'Brady Stewart', ""Thanks, Donnie. And Peter, that's a great question and one that we continually are studying. And I think when you unpack that cattle and feed report, there's a few comments that obviously are lending itself to the numbers that we're seeing. And part of it's relative to some slower turnover that we've seen. We've seen placements for cattle and feed from some of the drought areas as well from a geographical perspective. And as you indicated, which is the spotlight of the conversation is -- we have not seen significant heifer retention to date and continue to see those heifers move into the cattle and feed report. So continuing to focus on a few factors relative to heifer retention. Obviously, how these interest rates that we see today relative to the difference or the delta today versus some of the cycles in the past is a highlight for us to continue to watch. And then we'll continue to evaluate and understand how weather conditions are changed and lend themselves into a more favorable heifer retention strategy for these branches."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.', 'Adam Samuelson', ""Maybe coming back to chicken, and John, you gave some color in your prepared remarks, but hoping to expand on a little bit on just the profit drivers in the business in the quarter, there was $170 million feed of tailwind year-on-year, some offset with price. But can you maybe walk through the year-on-year profit bridge and chicken a little bit more closely. And I guess, apart from seasonality in the fiscal first quarter, -- our fiscal second quarter, excuse me -- the first quarter would imply kind of tracking to at or above the high end of the segment profit guidance for the year. So I just want to make sure we're understanding kind of some of the moving pieces you're looking at for the balance of fiscal '24."", 'John R. Tyson', ""Yes, Adam, thanks for the question. And maybe let me give a few points that will help you shape our '24 outlook compared to '23. I think the first thing to point out is we talked about the network moves, operational performance improvement. We started to realize that and the adjustment in our guidance range of taking the bottom end up by $100 million, roughly equivalent in line with where we were ahead of expectations for the balance of the year -- where we were compared to expectations. Then when I move through the balance of the year, I know one question is sometimes on investors' mind is, hey, where is your return on sales guidance, how does that peaking or not peaking, we've heard some questions about that. We're not going to return on sales guidance, but there's reasons to believe that our quarter 3 and quarter 4 could be around where we delivered the result in Q1. But frankly, it's probably premature to make any strong assertions around that.And then again Q2, we had weather impacts across all of our segments. Chicken was not immune to that. And so that's kind of the overall picture that we can give today based on the shape of the year. A couple of other things we're saying. We did talk about a couple of hundred million dollars in improvements on some previous earnings calls, thinking about the benefits we've realized from the network moves. We believe that we have achieved that. We have one facility still going core in Indiana. And when we close out that process, then we'll be nearly finished there. And then there are some tailwinds from a market standpoint. I think last quarter, Donnie was the one who said more tailwinds and headwinds, I think that sentiment prevails. But as you know, it's not just grain prices, but it's kind of the interplay between that and what chicken markets are doing and what's going on from a supply-demand standpoint to influence things.So I think overall, the $500 million to $700 million range for a lot of those reasons is our best estimate today of where we think the year will be. And yes, hopefully, that gives you a little extra color. Wes, maybe you got something to add in there for Adam."", 'Wes Morris', ""Yes. I'll add a couple of comments, Adam. We expect to realize our strategic change funding throughout the year. And specifically to your question on year-over-year, both grains and markets were both lower. So we stayed focused on improving our fundamentals year-over-year, did have a little tailwind, but it's mostly the material change we made in our fundamentals. We improved our live performance, specifically hatch and livability. We have a very disciplined S&OP process that got really tight in Q1 and our sales are not only sold out position, but our forecast accuracy has allowed us to do a better job filling orders with material less working capital."", 'Adam Samuelson', ""That's very helpful color. And then just as a follow-up, especially in Chicken and Prepared Foods. Just wondering if you have any views on changes in consumer behavior and how consumer demand elasticity has been evolving as you kind of enter as the calendar flipped and how you're thinking about the state of the U.S. consumer over the balance of calendar '24."", 'Melanie Boulden', ""Thanks, Adam. So I'll start first to talk about how we're looking at it from a Prepared Foods perspective and our branded portfolio. So generally, we're seeing elasticities returning to pre-COVID levels. And as you know, we seek to balance both price and volume growth to maximize the value of our branded portfolio. But at the end of the day, we do understand the financial uncertainty that our consumers are faced with as inflation remains elevated, which is why we continue to leverage our strong revenue growth management capabilities in support of our brands, and we're prioritizing their health and their profitability when determining our pricing strategy. And additionally, across the board for any of our branded business, we remain focused on understanding our category dynamics, assessing our competition and, of course, meeting our consumer needs when making pricing decisions."", 'Donnie D. King', ""Yes, Adam, I'd just add that we're seeing really good dark meat demand. We've seen the emergence of our win demand and we're seeing a slight shift towards Foodservice."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.', 'Kenneth B. Goldman', ""I wanted to ask a little bit about competition on the prepared food side. Are there any of your more important categories that you're starting to feel maybe a little incremental pressure in terms of competition, whether it's on the pricing side or however you want to frame it? And I guess how comfortable are you with your price gaps versus these competitors today just in a general sense."", 'Donnie D. King', ""So in terms of competition, I mean, regardless of the business, I mean there's -- we have some very strong competitors in every space that we play. And so I'll leave that there. But I'll give Melanie the opportunity to talk about more specifics in categories. For example, I would just simply say that we saw a strong performance in breakfast sausage and cocktails, and we had some headwinds in our lunch meat and our frozen protein breakfast area. Melanie, do you want to add to that?"", 'Melanie Boulden', ""Yes. I would just say, Ken, at the end of the day, this is a challenging consumer environment and boy, competition is stepping up. We're not only seeing competition step up from branded players, but also private label is a factor. And I think overall, we're doing very well and holding our position. But at the end of the day, we are just focused on our own retail business, in particular, and making sure that we're doing what we have to drive consumption, to address any price scraps and make sure that we are maintaining our leadership position in, which, as you know, in 8 of our 10 categories. So right now, we are focused on making sure that we grow through high ROI merchandising with a strong feature and display at shelf. We're increasing our map investment to continue to grow our household penetration. We've got strong innovation on shelf now and also coming, which is going to offer strong engagement with consumers. And very importantly, to address pricing. We're making sure that we're enhancing our price pack architecture offering so we can ensure that we are maximizing our distribution footprint. And we think all these steps together, we're starting to see actions in the marketplace and are confident in our full year outlook."", 'Kenneth B. Goldman', ""And then a follow-up is on chicken. As we look at some of the export data, and I realize some of the monthly data is a couple of months in arrears usually. But the export data in general in terms of pounds for chicken, they've been a little bit weaker as 2023 anyway, progressed. And yet as we start into 2024, at least according to Urner Barry, leg quarter prices have done pretty well, which might be not what one might expect at first glance is seeing the trade number. So just curious for a little bit of your thoughts on how to think about like demand for leg quarters, export demand in general? Any color there would be helpful."", 'Donnie D. King', ""Yes, I'll take that, Ken. Thanks. We've seen a lot of disruption in the (inaudible) export side. Specific to leg quarters, freezer stocks are at a really low level and demand seems to be robust enough to clear it at very attractive prices."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc.', 'Benjamin Shelton Bienvenu', ""I want to ask -- I know chicken has gotten a lot of focus, congrats on the quarterly results. John, I wanted to drill down on the 2Q commentary that you provided, recognizing there -- it sounds like there's some operational headwinds and disruptions from weather early in the year. What I'm curious on is if fundamental -- commodity fundamentals continue to improve and grain prices stay low, supply/demand comes into better balance, is that enough positive to offset the temporal operational dynamics that we saw in the second quarter?"", 'John R. Tyson', ""I think there are reasons to believe why some of that could offset it. But I think it would be -- I think, to quantify exactly what that offset yet is, we're not really ready to do that. But let's zoom out and talk about the broader year because I think I just want to hone in on some factors that are at play about why we remain cautious on the chicken outlook. And it has to do with what's going on in the total protein markets. Beef continues to be volatile. I think we've had predictions about where beef prices and beef markets we're going to go that have some is fell-through and some is not. There is projections for more pork to be on the market this year. We've already talked about the consumer today. So I just want to make sure that we ran the message today while they're -- we're cautiously optimistic about chicken, there remains a lot of uncertainty and a lot of time left in the year. So then I think I addressed at least parts of your question. Hopefully, that's helpful."", 'Donnie D. King', ""If I could add one thing or a couple of things to that as it relates to chicken. Those operational improvements that all of us have talked about in chicken those continue. And those fundamentals, while we are improved, there's still a lot of work left to do there. And we got a really good team working against those things. But keep that in mind as you are looking at Q2 and the balance of the year as well."", 'Benjamin Shelton Bienvenu', ""Okay. Very good. Thinking about the cash flow statement, John Randal, you guys came into fiscal '24, bringing down your CapEx budget materially. You've sustained the range again this quarter. Is there yet still room to tighten that budget as we move through the year? Or do you think that number is more set in stone with potentially improvements coming into 2025?"", 'John R. Tyson', ""That's a great question. I think there's probably room to tighten it a little bit, but let me kind of talk about the total picture. When we gave guidance in the first quarter, we talked about striving to be free cash flow positive that we would pay attention to our ability to manage the business and working capital as well as our operational results, and that would influence our thinking in terms of the total spend. If you just extrapolate where we are in Q1, that would take you towards a higher end of that 1.5% range. But that's really just a product of lot of good projects in flight that we have, our efforts to slow down from the spin that was projected in north of $2 billion in recent years.And I would just say we're not trending to that higher end because, hey, we've made some adjustment in our opening up the capital floodgates again. We remain very committed to getting that spend down to the midpoint of our range or below as we move through the balance of this year and next year. So that's what I want you to take away from a CapEx guidance standpoint."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO.', 'Andrew Strelzik', ""My first one is actually on the Pork segment and the outlook there. If I look at the performance in the quarter, and it seems like some solid performance is probably continuing into the second quarter. It doesn't seem like there's much baked into the back part of the year. So I guess, how are you thinking about pork margins from here evolving through the year and kind of the puts and takes as we get into the back part of the year?"", 'Donnie D. King', ""Let me start off, and then I will flip it to Brady to talk about pork. Hog supply drove lower hog costs, leading to improved spreads. We're seeing a number of benefits of better execution in pork, and we have assembled a really, really strong theme in our pork business led by Kyle and Aaron. He and his team have really picking out inefficiencies from procurement all the way to the customer, consumer and very proud of that work. But I would also tell you there's still room for more. And you will probably continue to hear that from us is there's -- every time we turn over rock, we find something else, but our mode is one of continual improvement. And Brady, any big nuggets that I have not touched on."", 'Brady Stewart', ""Thanks, Donnie. And Q1, obviously, is seasonally the strongest quarter of the year. And we'd expect to see some typical seasonality as we move through specifically the latter part of this year as well. The team understands it's their responsibility to control the controllables. And as Donnie indicated, done a really good job of being able to take advantage of some of the spreads we have seen in Q1 and certainly expect those improvements to continue through the course of the year as well. Really seeing some increased operational efficiencies, and the team has done a great job increasing the true business performance through the data and analytics platforms that they've stood up that allow us for better decision-making and really adaptation of some of these market trends in the current conditions."", 'Andrew Strelzik', ""Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then on the beef side, I guess, when I look at the typical seasonality and I look at kind of the performance in the first quarter and then the commentary on the second quarter, it seems like you would need to have pretty solid improvement in the back part of the year, not to be kind of towards the lower end of that range. I know there's seasonality involved there as well. I guess I'm just curious, can you talk about maybe what would get you to the high and low end of that range? I understand certainly that there's a lot of uncertainty as we move through the year. And then maybe can you clarify also when we think about the second quarter, are you thinking about sequentially lower off the number that you reported adjusted operating income in the first quarter? Or is that kind of once you back out the inventory adjustment?"", 'Brady Stewart', ""Well, thanks for the question. And as you pointed out there, I think it's really important to emphasize what both John and Donnie indicated in the opening remarks, which was in Q1, we saw that rapid decline in cattle futures and that was the driver for that inventory valuation adjustment that was roughly $56 million in the first quarter. And really, as we look at the first quarter, obviously, we saw some headwinds relative to some decreased value in the drop. We saw the spread compression. And obviously, with lower supply, not only in Q1, but as we move through the rest of the year, we see that lower opportunity for cost dilution of our overhead structure relative to these volumes. But let me be really clear, we see a path to improvement as well.And from an operational excellence perspective, how we manage the business today versus the past and a different economic cycle is very important. Focus on efficiency, yield and really balancing supply and demand, not only by a cut by cut basis and through our grinds complex. But also in terms of yield and efficiency is going to be paramount and important to the team, and they're dialed in on that as well. We've made changes that certainly provide us opportunity in the future as well as we mentioned last quarter. We've rightsized our beef value-added business really to match our customer needs and what we're seeing from a supply perspective as we move through this. And again, as I've mentioned before, we have a well-capitalized asset base, and believe we're really able to manage through a variety of headwinds and market conditions that we expect to see as we move through this cattle cycle."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays.', 'Benjamin M. Theurer', ""So just wanted to kind of understand a little bit some of the dynamics as it relates to the export business because if I remember right, that used to be some sort of a headwind also in beef. So if we look into the details on sales into the international channels, particularly beef, which kind of contrary to the rest of it was actually even down in the sales. Could you elaborate a little bit on the dynamics in the export markets as it relates to beef in particular, but also if you could just mention briefly what you're seeing on exports for chicken and pork. That would be my first question."", 'Donnie D. King', ""Sure. Well, thank you for the question. And I think it's really important to understand, we've really been working within historically high rates from a beef product or cut out perspective. And when we talk about the arbitrage opportunity between a domestic sale and an export sale really puts the domestic beef business and industry at a disadvantage right now. We're seeing large supplies from some of our competing countries that are in the southern hemisphere. And they're really on the opposite side of the cycle from we are -- from where we are. And so that's really led to increased opportunity for some of those competing countries and a decreased opportunity for us here in the U.S. However, we have seen strong domestic beef demand has led the -- held these cut-out values at a historically high level as well."", 'Wes Morris', ""Yes. And Ben, this is Wes. I'll touch briefly on chicken. As I said earlier, (inaudible) have been interrupted due to (inaudible). And on leg quarters, we're seeing frozen inventory in the U.S. at almost record lows. Our inventory continues to be in check, and the pricing has been very good going forward."", 'Benjamin M. Theurer', ""Okay. Perfect. And then just quickly following up as it relates to the Prepared Foods business. Can you quantify what the Williams sausage volume contribution was because I didn't find that. I know it was positive, but if you could quantify that, that would be helpful."", 'Donnie D. King', ""Yes. We haven't broken that out, but it's -- we haven't broken that out specifically, Ben."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. Please go ahead.', 'Thomas Hinsdale Palmer', ""Thanks for the question. Maybe I could ask on feed costs. Just how locked in is your exposure this year, and then when you look at the downward moves over the past few months, does this benefit your current fiscal year? Or if it continues, is this more of a 2025 flow through? Because it does seem like there's some incremental favorability."", 'Wes Morris', ""Yes, Tom, this is Wes. I'll touch on that. We have a very diverse commodity risk management group. We also have different pricing mechanisms with customers in which some of the grains flow through, through pricing. I would tell you it's moderate and in the back half of the year."", 'Thomas Hinsdale Palmer', ""Okay. And then I wanted to follow up on the prepared food side. Maybe going back to Peter Galbo's question. Just on on the new customer wins, are there particular products that you're seeing these wins, greatest in or particular channels within Foodservice?"", 'Melanie Boulden', ""So Tom, your question was -- I just want to make sure I'm clear. Are we -- are there particular products where you are seeing more success? Can you just repeat your question for me?"", 'Thomas Hinsdale Palmer', ""Yes. Sorry. Exactly. Just you've noted some -- your growth was driven by some new customer wins. And I was just curious what products were really driving that for you right now within Prepared Foods?"", 'Melanie Boulden', ""Yes. So I'd say that when I was talking about the customer expansion, we are making great strides in that area on the food service side of the business. And then I would say on the retail side of the business, we're seeing strong growth in distribution with our existing customers behind our core business lines, but we're also seeing excitement behind some of our -- a lot of our new innovation. And in particular, I want to highlight our Jimmy Dean Maple Griddle Cakes that we launched last year to success, and we are planning in a couple of months to launch an extension of that product item. Does that help, Tom?"", 'Donnie D. King', ""Tom, let me -- let me add a little more color as it relates to food service there. As a reminder to everyone, in the middle of the pandemic, we had some operational issues being able to produce enough product for our customers, and we essentially had to give up some business and we've been since the pandemic trying to go and regain that. But we have a nice diversification between what were the traditionally quick service restaurants and as well as broad line distribution."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.', 'Michael Scott Lavery', ""I want to come back to chicken and just trying to understand, obviously, the lift in the quarter was cost and margin driven. But when you point to the strategic actions and those benefits, can you help us understand maybe how to think of them kind of longer term? And would this put you at the higher end or above kind of a 5% to 7% margin range? I know you're not wanting to think about margins as how you guide for the year. You gave a little bit of breadcrumbs for the second half. That's all real helpful. But -- maybe just looking a little further out, is business structurally different enough that under normalized conditions, you would rethink what it's capable of, what its earnings power is longer term?"", 'Donnie D. King', ""So let me start -- this is Donnie. Let me start with a couple of points, and then I think John probably has a couple to add. But in terms of being prepared to give guidance, we're not prepared to do that today and talk about that. But what I can tell you is what we're doing as a company. We talked about the third consecutive quarter of over $100 million of AOI improvement. In the midst of that, what I can also tell you is market (inaudible) that's for grain or the meat side, those were largely offsetting one another. So the improvements are coming from operational improvements, operational excellence both in plants and in live production and really driving out waste from the business.But we also, as we said earlier, we're realizing the benefits from plant closures that in terms of modernizing and rightsizing our footprint. So we're seeing all of those. But this plan doesn't really is -- I mean, we've modeled the markets as they are today for the balance of the year, but this is all about operational excellence. And being more competitive and being better at what we do at the same time driving up raw material to a more value-added and branded within the Chicken segment. John?"", 'John R. Tyson', ""Yes, Donnie. It's a nice summary. I think, again, without touching on what the long-term outlook is like, the things I would point out about how the strategic moves we made have a sustaining impact in our business is a couple of things. First, we're just taking cost out of the system while still keeping the same amount of volume with our customers. Over the long run, that means not putting capital into older and more tired assets, rather investing in those assets where we think we could achieve our targeted ROIC number. And then I think the other thing, too, is we have really, in the last year, refocused our growth to be demand backed and to be in those subcategory within the Chicken segment, where we see favorable trends from a growth and margin standpoint. So I think with that over the long run, we project to be competing and performing as a best-in-class chicken company from a margin standpoint, and that's how we realize that.I think the other big move that we made, we've seen it in our live performance results this year is the switch from NAE to NAIHM and that provides us for a lot more consistency in order to meet customer demand and expectations from a life standpoint."", 'Michael Scott Lavery', ""Okay. That's helpful. Great. And just a follow-up on Prepared Foods. I understand it's obviously always competitive, and you touched on some of those dynamics. But can you give a sense on promotional levels. Would you say they're normalized again? Do you see increasing activity there? You called out some of the mix headwinds what was priced otherwise flat? Or I guess maybe could you dissect the price and mix pieces of that? And -- just a sense of how the environment looks from a promotional perspective? Is it getting more intense? Or does it seem to have stabilized? What's your sense of how that looks?"", 'Melanie Boulden', ""Yes. So this is Melanie, I would say that promotional activity is continuing -- we are continuing to see intense promotional activity. In terms of how we are operating, we have our highest performing, our highest ROI merchandising initiatives in place to drive our feature and display and choice at shelf, and we are seeing it working. But to your point, competitive activity in this area is strong and we're just focused on controlling our controllables. And in addition to our promotional activity, we're focused on, as I said before, increasing our map investment to engage consumers. Again, we've got strong innovation in place, and we're enhancing -- when you asked about price, we're making sure that we enhance our price pack architecture structure to address competitive pricing as well."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.', 'Alexia Jane Burland Howard', ""Okay. So 2 ones. Firstly, on the financial side. Your leverage has obviously come down, but it sounds as though whether there'll be more sequential improvement in operating income next quarter's EBD given the weather issues. Do you expect leverage to continue to come down from here? Or could next week -- next quarter the other high point?"", 'Donnie D. King', ""Yes. Thanks, Alexia. So I think 2 questions in there. The first off is just independent of weather, I want to make sure we're tracking independent of weather, we expect our Q2 to typically be one of the softer quarters from an operating income standpoint. And so then that's exacerbated by weather a little bit. In the long run, we are projecting for leverage to continue to come down. That's driven by a couple of things. One, we're getting more efficient with working capital. We've talked about an inventory clearing in our -- around our segments.Exactly kind of where things happen in the first half of the year, we can say that we would expect to end our fiscal 2024 in a better net leverage position from a ratio standpoint than last year. That's evident also in our pull down on CapEx and what we projected, which is to be a better year from an operating income and EBITDA standpoint than '23. So that's -- we're trending in the right direction aggressively pursuing that at or around 2x net leverage ratio. And we would project that. We'll get to do that, continue to invest in our business and also support our dividend from a capital allocation standpoint."", 'Alexia Jane Burland Howard', 'And then just as a follow-up, sticking with Prepared Foods, it sounds as though this mix shift into food service is obviously a good thing overall, but it is pushing the pricing down and potentially there might be a negative mix shift with margins. Are you able to clarify whether that price pressure will continue in future quarters? And are you able to talk about the margin differential between branded retail and food service and private label, which I assume is lower.', 'Donnie D. King', ""Okay. Alexia, this is Don. There are a lot of questions in there. Here's what I can tell you relative to food service and and keep this in mind. We've talked about it today because you have seen some volume improvement relative to Food Service. I would remind you that we had given up some business in the middle of pandemic and the nature of those contracts can be quite lengthy. And we're starting to get back in when those open up and get some volume.We have maintained in Prepared Foods and the capacity, which produces those products. So if you think about it from that perspective, this overhead in these assets have been a drag on our business to some degree. We've gotten new volume to put into those assets. So that's one piece of it. We're probably not going to talk about the differential in the margin structure between Food Service and Retail. But it's important that we regain that volume in Food Service. But our Retail -- our iconic brands in Retail, continuing to support those and grow those and innovate and do merchandising like Melanie has talked about before, those are all still critical -- mission critical for us."", 'Melanie Boulden', ""Yes. And the only thing, Alexia, I would like to add, because I think Donnie did a nice job of highlighting more of the top line, but also as we think about our business and our performance, one of the reasons that we were able to deliver a solid quarter and what we plan on continuing to do is focus on our controllables. The things we can control, especially from an operational efficiency standpoint. So we're really focused on improving our service levels, we're maximizing our asset utilization by driving down our overhead and increasing our yield and labor efficiencies. And importantly, we're driving automation to improve our supply chain execution. So from a top line perspective, yes, your question was about mix, but I just wanted to reiterate that we're also working all levers of the P&L to ensure that we drive strong bottom line as well."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.', 'John R. Tyson', ""Before Donnie wraps us up, I just want to make sure we land 1 final point related to our outlook for 2024. And we've had a lot of great discussion this morning about our various segments. We obviously moved the range on chicken and on pork, but I just want to highlight our reaffirmation of the total company guidance from $1 billion to $1.5 billion based on a lot of various macro factors and the interplay between all of our segments. I think we have reasons to believe while we could achieve a range of outcomes in that window, the midpoint plus or minus, we designed it that way for a reason, and it feels like a way to think about the total look.And then obviously, as we move through Q2 and through the balance of the year, we'll give any revisions as necessary. But cautiously optimistic, promising start to the year, but still a lot of factors at play around total protein availability, consumer sentiment and the other unpredictable factors that would get us to where we are. So Donnie, I think with that, I hand it over to you."", 'Donnie D. King', ""Okay. I want to say -- once again, say thank you to all 139,000 of our team members. We're here today and have a good story to tell because of those 139,000 team members who contribute to us each and every day. Their efforts are what makes and what drives this business forward. Our strategy is working. We have the right leadership team in place to deliver and we're poised to drive long-term opportunity and shareholder value. We've taken some steps in the right direction, but we have a lot of work to do.

This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the filing, offering investors a nuanced understanding of Tyson Foods Inc's strategic positioning."", ""Brand Portfolio and Market Presence: Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) boasts a robust portfolio of well-established brands such as Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, and Sara Lee. These brands have secured a significant presence in the U.S. market, particularly in the beef and chicken segments, which each account for about one-third of domestic sales. The company's Prepared Foods segment, representing approximately 20% of sales, benefits from a diverse product range that caters to various consumer preferences. Tyson's brand strength is underpinned by its ability to maintain and grow customer relationships, introduce innovative products, and leverage its scale to achieve operational efficiencies."", ""Operational Scale and Diversification: Tyson Foods Inc's large-scale operations provide a competitive edge in terms of cost efficiency and market reach. The company's diversified product offerings across beef, pork, chicken, and prepared foods allow it to mitigate risks associated with market volatility in individual segments. Tyson's extensive distribution network, including international markets that contribute 5% of total revenue, enhances its ability to serve a global customer base and capitalize on cross-border growth opportunities."", ""Financial Performance Volatility: The recent 10-Q filing reveals a concerning drop in net income attributable to Tyson, which plummeted from $316 million to $107 million year-over-year. This decline reflects the volatility in financial performance that Tyson Foods Inc faces, driven by fluctuating commodity prices, supply chain disruptions, and competitive pressures. The company's cost of sales increased from $12,292 million to $12,496 million, outpacing sales growth and squeezing gross profit margins from $968 million to $823 million. Such financial volatility can impact investor confidence and the company's ability to invest in growth initiatives."", ""Legal and Operational Challenges: Tyson Foods Inc's operational income was adversely affected by significant charges, including $75 million in plant closure charges, $73 million in legal contingency accruals, and $30 million of restructuring and related charges. These challenges highlight the company's exposure to legal risks and the costs associated with maintaining operational efficiency. The need to navigate complex regulatory environments and manage legal disputes can divert resources from strategic growth areas and impact the bottom line."", ""International Expansion: While Tyson Foods Inc currently generates a modest 5% of its total revenue from international markets, there is significant room for growth in regions with increasing protein demand. The company's existing presence in key markets such as Australia, China, Malaysia, Mexico, and others provides a foundation for scaling operations and capturing market share. By leveraging its brand strength and operational expertise, Tyson can tap into emerging markets, where rising incomes and changing dietary preferences favor increased protein consumption."", ""Innovation and Product Development: Consumer trends toward convenience, health, and sustainability present opportunities for Tyson Foods Inc to innovate and expand its product offerings. The company's focus on prepared foods, including ready-to-eat and value-added products, aligns with the shift towards convenient meal solutions. Continued investment in product development, particularly in plant-based protein alternatives, can help Tyson meet evolving consumer demands and drive long-term growth."", 'Market Competition and Price Sensitivity: Tyson Foods Inc operates in highly competitive segments where it does not always hold a significant market share lead. Intense competition from both established players and new entrants can lead to price wars, eroding margins and market position. The company must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to maintain consumer loyalty and pricing power in a market characterized by price sensitivity and low switching costs.', ""Supply Chain and Commodity Risks: The company's reliance on live cattle and hogs, raw materials, and feed ingredients exposes it to supply chain vulnerabilities and commodity price fluctuations. Adverse weather conditions, disease outbreaks, and geopolitical tensions can disrupt supply chains and lead to cost increases. Tyson Foods Inc must navigate these risks through strategic sourcing, hedging, and supply chain management practices to ensure stability and profitability."", 'In conclusion, Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) exhibits a strong brand portfolio and operational scale that position it well in the protein-focused food industry. However, the company faces challenges in terms of financial performance volatility and legal contingencies that could impact its growth trajectory. Opportunities for international expansion and product innovation present pathways to enhance market share and revenue. Nevertheless, Tyson must strategically manage threats from market competition and supply chain risks to sustain its competitive advantage and deliver value to shareholders.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

As you may have seen in our press release this morning, fiscal 2024 is off to a good start, with solid performance in Q1 giving us confidence in our full year outlook. The momentum we established in the back half of last year continued in Q1, highlighted by a $175 million improvement in adjusted operating income, 130 basis points of AOI margin expansion, and near doubling of adjusted EPS, all on a sequential basis. As we begin fiscal '24, we're witnessing the benefits of our core multiprotein portfolio."", ""Chicken and pork are offsetting beef headwinds, while prepared foods continued to generate strong profit dollars and margins. While we can't control the macro environment, our focus on what we can control has been evident in Q1. Our performance reflects a commitment to operational excellence. We are more agile, collaborative, and disciplined business than a year ago."", ""And we have a long runway of opportunities in front of us. I'm proud of our team members' continued efforts to enhance operational performance and want to thank all of them for their high level of engagement and their part in delivering our results in this quarter. We're controlling what we can to drive cash flow as well. Our disciplined approach to capex and working capital helped generate strong cash flow in the quarter."", ""Prudent cash deployment is part of our strategy to build financial strength and will position us well when market dynamics turn in our favor. You've seen us take bold actions to improve performance, and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence and address inefficiencies. Our plan is working, and we're seeing tangible benefits of our efforts, as evidenced by improvements in chicken and pork. While I'm pleased by the performance in Q1, we still have more work ahead of us and we're cautiously optimistic and laser-focused on achieving what we set out to do this year."", ""Our brands resonate with consumers, and we're maintaining a strong market share despite comparing to our record position last year and some overall category consumption softness in Q1. We will continue to support our brands through innovation, marketing, and strong customer partnerships while meeting consumers where they are. I remain highly confident in our long-term strategy, based on a broad portfolio of core proteins and strong brands, and I'm optimistic about our future. We're leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders."", ""Now, let's delve into an update on share position of our branded portfolio. Our Q1 pound share in our core business lines, which include product lines from our iconic brands Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, State Fair, Aidells, and Ball Park, remains at historically high levels despite a modest decline compared to record share in Q1 last year. In fact, our core business lines have grown pound share by more than 400 basis points since Q1 of 2019. While inflation is easing, consumers are still facing high prices compared to two years ago."", ""However, they are still willing to purchase brands they know and trust, and this is reflected in our share. We're also focused on customer elasticity and balancing with our own costs. We believe our approach is working. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonates strongly with consumers."", 'Over the past year, nearly three out of four U.S. households purchased a Tyson core business line product, and this penetration rate is growing. What gets me even more excited is that our product line with the highest penetration rate is only in about a third of households, leaving us plenty of room for continued growth over the long run. Moving on to segment performance, starting with prepared foods.', 'Our food service volumes continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification and margin accretive channels. Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove strong adjusted operating profits and margins. Our branded foods business remains a strategic growth pillar, and we are committed to supporting and growing our brands through innovation, price pack architecture, high ROI, marketing support, and strong customer partnerships. This is critically important in an economic environment where consumers remain more discerning with their purchasing decisions.', ""In chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal '23 continued in Q1, with a third consecutive quarter of over $100 million in sequential AOI increase. Operational improvements, including the bold actions we've taken, along with improvements in live operations, yield labor efficiency and customer service, as well as improving market conditions, were the primary drivers in Q1. In beef, limited cattle supply led to spread compression, as we expected. Roughly half the loss in Q1 was related to an inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily driven by highly volatile cattle futures."", 'While spreads are expected to remain tight, our goal remains to be best-in-class operators so that we can manage the business as efficiently as possible. We have identified incremental opportunities to improve our execution and help offset some of the challenges from this current cattle cycle. Turning to pork. Better supply drove lower hog costs, leading to improving spreads.', ""Our team's focus on operational execution allowed us to capture the benefits of these favorable market dynamics, which resulted in improved profits both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before I hand it over to John for a financial review, let's reiterate our priorities for the year. First, we're committed to improving our financial strength and driving cash flow to support our dividend, as demonstrated in Q1. Over the past year, we announced the closure of six of our older, less efficient plants in chicken and two of our smaller beef case-ready value-added facilities."", ""We are already seeing the benefits of these actions, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to drive efficiency across our segments. In chicken, our focus on enhancing our competitiveness continues. In prepared foods, we want to build growth momentum behind capacity additions coming online, increase our brand household penetration, and diversify and grow our food service business. In beef, we acknowledge the challenges, and we'll be prepared for multiple outcomes during the current cattle cycle."", ""In pork, we're gaining momentum and operational execution and are excited for continued improvements. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results and outlook."", 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Donnie. I'll start with an overview of our total company results before moving on to our individual segments. Sales in Q1 grew slightly year over year, as an increase in beef revenue was nearly offset by a decrease in chicken. The decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in beef, which was partially offset by growth in chicken and pork."", ""It's important to note that AOI improved significantly on a sequential basis despite the modest decline versus last year. Adjusted EPS nearly doubled compared to last quarter, highlighting the ongoing improvement in our operational performance. Now, let's review our segment results, starting with prepared foods. In prepared foods, Q1 revenue was flat year over year."", 'Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition and continued recovery in our food service business. Lower pricing primarily reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q1 was also in line with last year. Lower raw material cost and operational efficiencies were offset by increased brand support expenses, start-up costs associated with new capacity additions, and mix.', 'AOI dollars and margin both increased significantly on a sequential basis due to strong operational performance and great seasonal execution by the team. Moving on to chicken. Sales in Q1 declined 5.4% year over year, primarily driven by the impact of lower commodity protein prices. Volume declined 1.5% due to lower production, which was partially offset by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory.', 'Despite the decline in sales versus last year, AOI more than doubled in Q1, primarily driven by the benefits of our strategic actions and other operational efficiencies. These include lower plant spend, improved yield, and better live performance. While input costs were a clear tailwind, these were largely offset by the impact of lower pricing. As Donnie mentioned, this is the third consecutive quarter of more than $100 million of AOI improvement as we were able to pull forward the benefits of closures of inefficient plants and improvements in our live operations.', 'Now, moving to beef. In beef, revenue increased 6.4% year over year in Q1, with lower head throughput more than offset by higher prices per pound. While revenue increased, AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads, as was expected. As Donnie mentioned, in Q1, nearly half of the operating loss was driven by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily due to the rapid and significant decline in cattle futures.', 'Moving to pork. Q1 revenue was down modestly as volume growth was offset by lower pricing. However, AOI increased year over year, benefiting primarily from improved spreads, driven by lower hog costs, as well as better execution. And finally, a brief comment on our international business.', 'AOI improved as we begin to lap some of the start-up cost of our newer facilities and continue to focus on improving execution despite a decline in sales driven by macroeconomic challenges. Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Our commitment to building financial strength, investing in our business, and returning cash to shareholders primarily via our dividend remains unwavering. While market conditions remain challenging, we are laser-focused on disciplined management and deployment of our capital resources to drive cash flow.', ""Q1 showcased robust operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, above our expectations, and working capital was a solid source of cash as we continued to manage inventory levels. We were also disciplined with capex, which came in at just over $350 million in the quarter, below last year's exit rate. During the quarter, we returned $171 million to shareholders via dividends. Our net leverage declined sequentially, coming below four times, driven by our improved profitability and strong cash generation."", 'We ended Q1 with more than $3.7 billion of liquidity. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged. We are committed to building financial strength and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning net leverage to at or below two times net debt to EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.', ""Now, let's take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. Given the solid results in Q1, we have confidence that our financial performance in 2024 will improve versus last year. However, as it's still early in the new fiscal year and uncertainties remain, especially in our beef segment, we have made only modest changes to our outlook. Our focus for fiscal 2024 remains to manage the business for profit and cash dollar generation, reflected in our guidance presented in dollar terms, rather than margin percentages."", 'With that in mind, we are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year over year. Moving to each of the segments. Prepared foods had a solid start and a seasonally strong period. For the remainder of the year, we expect strong volume results as we continue our momentum in food service and see the benefits of our capacity additions.', ""We remain focused on operational efficiencies while we support our brands and anticipate continued start-up costs. Taking all this into account, we're maintaining our AOI guidance to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. In chicken, our operational turnaround is progressing as anticipated. For the remainder of the year, we expect a return to normal seasonality, where Q2 is typically a weaker quarter."", 'Given the strong start in Q1 and that we believe that there were more tailwinds than headwinds, we are tightening our AOI guidance range to be between $500 million and $700 million. In beef, spreads are compressing as expected. However, uncertainty remains around how the cattle cycle will progress. Therefore, we are maintaining our full year guidance at a loss of $400 million to breakeven.', ""In pork, on the back of our strong Q1 results, we're now raising our guidance to be between breakeven and $100 million. For the total company AOI, we're maintaining our guidance of between 1 billion and 1.5 billion, reflecting the portfolio nature of our segments. To round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million and a tax rate to now be between 23% and 24%. Turning to capex."", ""We're maintaining tight controls on spending, in line with profitability and cash flow, and we expect capex to remain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion this year. Finally, on free cash flow, we're committed to managing working capital and capex, and we're even more confident now than we were last quarter that we will generate positive free cash flow for the year. To further help model the shape of the rest of the year, we anticipate more typical seasonality across our business. As a reminder, Q2 is seasonally our weakest quarter for AOI and cash flow, driven by beef and chicken."", ""And as you may be aware, this January has already been impacted by severe winter weather disrupting operations. And again, we expect start-up costs in prepared foods to impact Q2 as well. So, in summary, 2024 is off to a promising start, and we're cautiously optimistic on our prospects for the remainder of the year, as well as for the long term. Tyson is a leader in the global protein industry."", ""We have strong brands, a broad portfolio of products, and a great team, all of which uniquely position us to win in the market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions."", 'Sean Cornett -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Thanks, John. We will now move on to your question. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.', '', 'Operator', 'We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Peter Galbo -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.', 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Peter.', 'Peter Galbo -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Donnie, I was just wondering if you could give kind of maybe a brief state of the union. You know, I know you gave some in your prepared remarks, but across the segments, and then maybe specifically if you could start on prepared foods where, you know, unlike a lot of CPG peers, you're showing actual volume growth. Some of that may be acquired. But just some of the dynamics around food service there seemed to be a pretty important driver."", 'So, if you can unpack that for us would be great.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Thanks, Peter. I'll start off and maybe I'll have others to weigh in. Let me start off just kind of the state of the union."", 'We had a solid first quarter, and we continue to build on the momentum of the back half of 2023. We are seeing the benefits of our portfolio. For chicken and pork, improvements are offsetting challenges in beef, and where our prepared foods continues to deliver strong results. We continue to restore performance in our chicken business.', ""As I said earlier, this was our third consecutive quarter of $100 million of AOI improvement. And this -- our chicken business remains a top priority of mine. We're managing beef through the volatility and spread tightening of the cycle. We're making great progress in driving out inefficiencies all across the supply chain in pork."", ""Prepared foods is performing to plan. While we have seen softness in the retail channel, our brands have performed well. Core brand share remains near record levels, and we're gaining share in our food service business. And I'll talk more about that in a moment."", ""We're cautiously optimistic about FY '24. We have considered our better-than-expected results in this quarter. We've considered our initiatives to improve performance while also still accounting for the ongoing macro uncertainty. As John said in his opening statements, Q2 is seasonally weaker and our Q2 started off with -- has started off with several significant weather events."", ""But having said all that, taken together, it's still early in the year, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we're leaving no stone unturned. We're focused on capex and working capital to drive cash flow and support our dividend. We are controlling the controllables and taking necessary action, including rightsizing and modernizing our footprint and network design to drive efficiencies."", ""We are pleased with the quarter and believe we're taking the right steps. We are excited about our future and are focused on creating value for our shareholders. Specifically -- or a little bit more specifically, in terms of prepared foods, to your question, Peter, we had -- in the quarter, we had strong top- and bottom-line performance in the quarter, with meaningful sequential improvement versus Q4 of '23. If you look at the makeup of the volume, it was driven by a balanced portfolio between retail and food service."", ""We're regaining some share lost in the middle of the pandemic that we couldn't support, and we also had the acquisition from a volume standpoint of Williams Sausage. Our branded core business line remained a key focus, and we have a competitive advantage with volume share near record levels and 400 basis points above Q1 '19. Let me stop with that. Melanie, anything you would add to what I've said?"", 'Melanie Boulden -- Group President, Prepared Foods and Chief Growth Officer', ""Yeah, Donnie. I think you did a great job hitting the highlights. The only thing I'll add for you, Peter, is, as Donnie said, our food service performance was strong. And I believe you asked about this question."", ""Our growth this quarter was up 3%, and that was due to customer expansion. Look, as this channel is rebounding, it continues to be an important part of our portfolio that we are focused on because we want to be where our consumers are at. And so, we're diversifying our customer base. We're building digital capabilities to drive demand, and we are focused on profitable growth."", 'Peter Galbo -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks for all that. And then, just maybe quickly, as a follow-up on beef, Donnie, you know, look, the cattle inventory report out last week. Seems like, you know, maybe we're nearing a bottom or seeing potentially some improvement."", ""But just what's the conversation like with ranchers at this point? Like, what's it going to take to get them to actually start the heifer retention process because I think that remains kind of the biggest linchpin in the whole chain and it doesn't seem like we have a lot of clarity there yet? Thanks very much."", 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I mean, I'll tell you, we look at the same information that I'm sure you've seen, and we saw the Cattle on Feed report that you referenced. You know, unfortunately, Peter, the data doesn't indicate that heifer retention is taking place. And that's obviously one of the signposts we're looking for."", ""In the quarter, we continue to see volatility and spread tightening. We expected that. As we think about our outlook, we continue to project tight cattle supplies for the balance of '24 and even beyond. And let me pause."", 'Brady, do you want to add anything to that?', 'Brady Stewart -- Group President, Beef, Pork and Chief Supply Chain Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Donnie. And, Peter, that's a great question and one that we continually are studying. And I think when you unpack that Cattle on Feed report, there's a few comments that obviously are lending itself to the numbers that we're seeing, and part of it's relative to some slower turnover that we've seen."", ""We've seen placements for Cattle on Feed from some of the drought areas as well from a geographical perspective. And as you indicated, which is the spotlight of the conversation is, we have not seen significant heifer retention to date and continue to see those heifers move into the Cattle on Feed report. So, continuing to focus on a few factors relative to heifer retention. Obviously, how these interest rates that we see today relative to the difference or the delta today versus some of the cycles in the pack -- in the past is a highlight for us to continue to watch."", ""And then we'll continue to evaluate and understand how weather conditions are changed and lend themselves into a more favorable heifer retention strategy for these ranchers."", 'Peter Galbo -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thanks very much.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Peter.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Adam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Adam.', 'Adam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Good morning. So, maybe, coming back to chicken, and, John, you gave some color in your prepared remarks but hoping to expand on a little bit on just the profit drivers in the business in the quarter. There was 170 million of feed tailwind year on year, some offset with price. But can you maybe walk through the year-on-year profit bridge in chicken a little bit more closely? And I guess apart from seasonality in the fiscal first quarter, the -- or fiscal second quarter, excuse me, the first quarter would imply kind of tracking to at or above the high end of the segment profit guidance for the year.', ""So, I just want to make sure we're understanding kind of some of the moving pieces you're looking at for the balance of fiscal '24."", 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Adam. Thanks for the question, and maybe let me give a few points that will help you shape, you know, our '24 outlook compared to '23. I think the first thing to point out is we talked about the network moves, operational performance improvement. We started to realize that."", ""And the adjustment in our guidance range of taking the bottom end up by $100 million, roughly equivalent in line with where, you know, we were ahead of expectations for the balance of the year. Or excuse me, where we were compared to expectations. Then when I moved through the balance of the year, I know one question that is sometimes on investors' minds is, hey, where is your return on sales guidance? You know, how does that peaking or not peaking? We've heard some questions about that. We're not going to return on sales guidance, but there's reasons to believe that our Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 could be around where we delivered the result in Q1."", ""But frankly, it's probably premature to make any strong assertions around that. And then again, Q2, we had weather impacts across all of our segments. Chicken was not immune to that. And so, that's kind of the overall picture that we can give today based on the shape of the year."", ""A couple other things we're saying. We did talk about a couple hundred million dollars in improvements on some previous earnings calls. Thinking about the benefits we realized from the network moves, we believe that we have achieved that. We have one facility still going core in Indiana."", ""And when we, you know, close out that process, then we'll be nearly finished there. And then there are some tailwinds from a market standpoint. I think last quarter, Donnie was the one who said more tailwinds than headwinds. I think that sentiment prevails."", ""But as you know, it's not just grain prices, but it's kind of the interplay between that and what chicken markets are doing and what's going on from a supply demand standpoint that influence things. So, I think, overall, you know, the 500 to 700 range, for a lot of those reasons, is our best estimate today of where we think the year will be. And yeah, hopefully, that gives you a little extra color. Wes, maybe you got something to add in there for Adam."", 'Wes Morris -- Group President, Poultry', ""Yeah, I'd add a couple of comments, Adam. We expect to realize our strategic change in fundings throughout the year. And specifically to your question, on year over year, both grains and markets were both lower. And so, we stayed focused on improving our fundamentals."", ""Year over year did have a little tailwind, but it's mostly the material change we made in our fundamentals. We improved our live performance, specifically hatch and livability. We have a very disciplined S&OP process that got really tied in Q1. And our sales are not only sold out position, but our forecast accuracy has allowed us to do a better job filling orders with material less working capital."", 'Adam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""And now, that's very helpful color. Then just as a follow-up, especially in chicken and prepared foods, just wondering if you have any views on changes in consumer behavior and how consumer demand elasticity has been evolving as you kind of enter -- as the calendar is flipped and how you're thinking about the state of the U.S. consumer over the balance of calendar '24."", 'Melanie Boulden -- Group President, Prepared Foods and Chief Growth Officer', ""Thanks, Adam. So, I'll start first to talk about how we're looking at it from a prepared foods perspective and our branded portfolio. So, generally, we're seeing elasticities returning to pre-COVID levels. And as you know, we seek to balance both price and volume growth to maximize the value of our branded portfolio."", ""But, you know, at the end of the day, we do understand the financial uncertainty that our consumers are faced with as inflation remains elevated, which is why we continue to leverage, you know, our strong revenue growth management capabilities in support of our brands and we're prioritizing their health and their profitability when determining our pricing strategy. And additionally, across the board for any of our branded business, you know, we remain focused on understanding our category dynamics, assessing our competition, and, of course, you know, meeting our consumer needs when making pricing decisions."", 'Wes Morris -- Group President, Poultry', ""Yeah, Adam. Melanie said that we're seeing really good dark meat demand. We've seen a reemergence of our waned demand, and we're seeing a slight shift toward food service."", 'Adam Samuelson -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""All right. That's all really helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you."", 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Adam.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'Ken Goldman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Hi. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask a little bit about competition on the prepared foods side. Are there any of your more important categories that you're starting to feel, you know, maybe a little incremental pressure in terms of competition, whether it's on the pricing side or however you want to frame it? And I guess, how comfortable are you with your price gaps versus these competitors today, just in a general sense?"", 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, in terms of competition, I mean, regardless of the business, I mean, there's -- we have some very strong competitors in every space that we play. And so, I'll leave that there, but I'll give Melanie the opportunity to talk about more specifics in categories. For example, I would just simply say that we saw strong performance in breakfast sausage and cocktails, and we had some headwinds in our lunch meat and our frozen protein breakfast area. Melanie, you want to add to that?"", 'Melanie Boulden -- Group President, Prepared Foods and Chief Growth Officer', ""Yeah. I would just say, you know, Ken, at the end of the day, this is a challenging consumer environment. And, boy, competition is stepping up. We're not only seeing, you know, competition setup -- step up from branded players, but also private label is a factor."", ""And I think, you know, overall, we're doing very well and holding our position. But at the end of the day, we are just focused on our own retail business, in particular, and making sure that we're doing what we have to to drive consumption, to address any price gaps, and make sure that we are, you know, maintaining our leadership position in -- which, as you know, in eight of our 10 categories. So, right now, we are focused on making sure, you know, that we grow through high ROI merchandising with a strong feature and display at shelf. We're increasing our map investment to continue to grow."", ""You know, our household penetration. We've got strong innovation on shelf now and also coming, which is going to offer, you know, a strong engagement with consumers. And very importantly, to address pricing, we're making sure that we're enhancing our price pack architecture offerings so we can ensure that we are maximizing our distribution footprint. And we think all these steps, you know, together, we're starting to see actions in the marketplace and, you know, are confident in our full year outlook."", 'Ken Goldman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Thank you for that. And then a follow-up is on chicken. You know, as we look at some of the export data, and I realize, you know, some of the monthly data is a couple of months in arrears usually. But, you know, the export data, in general, in terms of pounds for chicken, you know, they've been a little bit weaker as 2023 anyway progressed."", 'And yet, as we start into 2024, you know, at least according to Urner Barry, leg quarter prices have done pretty well, which, you know, might be, you know, not what one might expect at first glance, just seeing the trade numbers. So, just curious for a little bit of your thoughts on, you know, how to think about like demand for leg quarters, export demand in general. Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.', 'Wes Morris -- Group President, Poultry', ""Yeah. I'll take that, Ken. Thanks. You know, we've seen a lot of disruption in the part export side."", 'Specific to leg quarters, freezer stocks are at a really low level, and demand seems to be robust enough to clear it at very attractive prices.', 'Ken Goldman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.', 'Ben Bienvenu -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', 'Hi. Thanks. Good morning.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Ben.', 'Ben Bienvenu -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', ""I want to ask -- I know chicken's gotten a lot of focus. Congrats on the quarterly results. John, I wanted to drill down on the 2Q commentary that you provided, recognizing that it sounds like there are some operational headwinds and disruptions from weather early in the year. What I'm curious on is if fundamental -- commodity fundamentals continue to improve and grain prices stay low, supply demand comes into better balance, is that enough positives to offset the, you know, temporal operational dynamics that we saw in the second quarter?"", 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I think there are reasons to believe why some of that could offset it, but I think it would be -- I think, you know, to quantify exactly what that offset is, we're not totally ready to do that. But let's zoom out and talk about the broader year because I think I just want to hone in on some factors that are at play about why we remain cautious on the chicken outlook. And it has to do with what's going on in the total protein markets. Beef continues to be volatile."", ""I think, you know, we've had predictions about where beef prices and beef markets were going to go that have, you know, some have held true or some have not. There is projections for more pork to be on the market this year. We've already talked about the consumer today. So, I just want to make sure that we land the message today."", ""While there -- we're cautiously optimistic about chicken, there remains a lot of uncertainty and a lot of time left in the year. So, Ben, I think I addressed at least parts of your question. Hopefully, that's helpful."", 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'And, John --', 'Ben Bienvenu -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', ""That's great. Sure."", 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""If I could add one thing or a couple of things to that as it relates to chicken, those operational improvements that all of us have talked about in chicken, those continue. And those fundamentals, while we are improved, there's still a lot of work left to do there, and we got a really good team working against those things. But keep that in mind as you are looking at Q2 and the balance of the year as well."", 'Ben Bienvenu -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', ""OK. Very good. Thinking about the cash flow statement, John Randal, you guys came into fiscal '24 bringing down your capex budget materially. You've sustained the range again this quarter."", 'Is there yet still room to tighten that budget as we move through the year or do you think that number is more set in stone with potentially improvements coming into 2025?', 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Those are great questions. I think there's probably a room to tighten it a little bit, but let me kind of talk about the total picture. When we gave guidance in the first quarter, we talked about striving to be free cash flow positive, that we would pay attention to our ability to manage the business and working capital, as well as our operational results, and that would influence our thinking in terms of the total spend. If you just extrapolate where we are in Q1, that would take you toward a higher end to that 1.5 range."", ""But that's really just a product of a lot of good projects in flight that we have, our efforts to slow down from the spend that was, you know, projected in north of $2 billion in recent years. And I would just say, we're not trending to that higher end because, hey, we've made some adjustment in our -- you know, opening up the capital floodgates. Again, we remain very committed to getting that spend down to the midpoint of our range or below as we move through the balance of this year and next year. So, that's what I want you to take away from a capex guidance standpoint."", 'Ben Bienvenu -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks so much.', 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure, Ben.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Ben.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please go ahead.', 'Andrew Strelzik -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is actually on the pork segment and the outlook there.', ""If I look at the performance in the quarter, and it seems like, you know, some solid performance is probably continuing into the second quarter, it doesn't seem like there's much baked into the back part of the year. So, I guess, how are you thinking about pork margins from here evolving through the year and kind of the puts and takes as we get into the back part of the year?"", 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Let me start off, and then I will flip it to Brady to talk about pork. Hog supply drove lower hog costs, leading to improved spreads. We're seeing a number of benefits of better execution in pork, and we have assembled a really, really strong team in our pork business, led by Kyle Narron. And he and his team have really taken out inefficiencies, from procurement, all the way to the customer and consumer."", ""And I'm very proud of that work. But I would also tell you, there's still room for more. And you will probably continue to hear that from us is there's -- every time we -- excuse me, every time we turn over a rock, we find something else, but where our mode is, is one of continual improvement. And, Brady, any big nuggets that I have not talked about?"", 'Brady Stewart -- Group President, Beef, Pork and Chief Supply Chain Officer', ""No. Thanks, Donnie. And Q1, obviously, is seasonally the strongest quarter of the year, and we'd expect to see some typical seasonality as we move through specifically the latter part of this year as well. The team understands it's their responsibility to control the controllables and, as Donnie indicated, done a really good job of being able to take advantage of some of the spreads we have seen in Q1, and certainly expect those improvements to continue through the course of the year as well."", ""Really seeing some increased operational efficiencies. And the team has done a great job increasing the true business performance through the data and analytics platforms that they've stood up that allows for better decision-making and, really, adaptation of some of these market trends in the current conditions."", 'Andrew Strelzik -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""OK. Great. That's helpful. And then on the beef side, you know, I guess, when I look at the typical seasonality and I look at kind of the performance in the first quarter and then the commentary on the second quarter, it seems like you would need to have a pretty solid improvement in the back part of the year, you know, not to be kind of toward the lower end of that range."", ""And I know there's seasonality involved there as well. I guess I'm just curious, can you talk about maybe, you know, what would get you to the high end and low end of that range? I understand certainly that there's a lot of uncertainty as we move through the year. And then maybe can you clarify also, when we think about the second quarter, are you thinking about sequentially lower of the number that you reported adjusted operating income in the first quarter, or is that kind of once you back out the inventory adjustment? Thanks."", 'Brady Stewart -- Group President, Beef, Pork and Chief Supply Chain Officer', ""Well, thanks for the question. And as you pointed out there, I think it's really important to emphasize what both John and Donnie indicated in the opening remarks, which was in Q1, we saw that rapid decline in cattle futures, and that was the driver for that inventory valuation adjustment. That was roughly $56 million in the first quarter. And really, as we look at the first quarter, obviously, we saw some headwinds relative to some decreased value in the drop."", 'We saw the spread compression. And obviously, with lower supply, not only in Q1, but as we move through the rest of the year, we see that lower opportunity for cost dilution of our overhead structure relative to these volumes. But let me be really clear. We see a path to improvement as well.', ""And from an operational excellence perspective, how we manage the business today versus the past and a different economic cycle is very important. Focus on efficiency, yield, and really balancing supply and demand, not only by a cut-by-cut basis and through our grinds complex, but also in terms of yield and efficiency is going to be paramount and important to the team. And they're dialed in on that as well. We've made changes that certainly provide us opportunity in the future as well."", ""As we mentioned last quarter, we've rightsized our beef value-added business really to match our customer needs. And what we're seeing from a supply perspective as we move through this, and again, as I mentioned before, we have a well-capitalized asset base and believe we're really able to manage through a variety of headwinds and market conditions that we expect to see as we move through this cattle cycle."", 'Andrew Strelzik -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ben Theurer with the Bank of America -- excuse me, with Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'Ben Theurer -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, Donnie and John. Thanks for taking my question.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Ben Theurer -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""So, just wanted to kind of understand a little bit some of the dynamics as it relates to the export business because if I remember right, that used to be some sort of a headwind also in beef. So, if we look into the details on sales into the international channels, particularly beef, it was kind of contrary to the rest of it. It was actually even down on sales. Could you elaborate a little bit on the dynamics in the export markets as it relates to beef in particular? But also, if you could just mention briefly what you're seeing on exports for chicken and pork? That would be my first question."", 'Thank you.', 'Brady Stewart -- Group President, Beef, Pork and Chief Supply Chain Officer', ""Sure. Well, thank you for the question. And I think it's really important to understand we've really been working within historically high rates from a beef product or cut-out perspective. And when we talk about the arbitrage opportunity between a domestic sale and an export sale, it really puts the domestic beef business and industry at a disadvantage right now."", ""We're seeing large supplies from some of our competing countries that are in the Southern hemisphere, and they're really on the opposite side of the cycle from we are -- from where we are. And so, that's really led to increased opportunity for some of those competing countries and a decreased opportunity for us here in the U.S. However, we have seen strong domestic beef demand. It has led the -- held these cut-out values at a historically high level as well."", 'Wes Morris -- Group President, Poultry', ""Yeah. And, Ben, this is Wes. I saw the -- I'll touch briefly on chicken. As I said earlier, you know, parts have been interrupted due to [Inaudible] And on leg quarters, we're seeing frozen inventory in the U.S."", 'at almost record lows. Our inventory continues to be in check, and the pricing has been very good going forward.', 'Ben Theurer -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""OK. Perfect. Thank you very much. And then just quickly following up, as it relates to the prepared foods business, can you quantify what the Williams Sausage volume contribution was because I didn't find that? I know it was positive, but if you could quantify that, that would be helpful."", 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. We haven't broken that out, but, you know, it's -- we haven't broken that out specifically, Ben."", 'Ben Theurer -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""OK. That's OK. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. Please go ahead.', 'Tom Palmer -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Good morning and thanks for the question. Maybe -- could ask on feed costs. Just how locked in is your exposure this year? And then when we look at the downward moves over the past few months, does this benefit your current fiscal year; or if it continues, is this more of a 2025 flow-through because it does seem like there's some incremental favorability?"", 'Wes Morris -- Group President, Poultry', ""Yeah, Tom. This is Wes. I'll touch on that. We have a very diverse commodity risk management group."", ""We also have different pricing mechanisms with customers, in which some of the grains flow through through pricing. I would tell you, it's moderate and in the back half of the year."", 'Tom Palmer -- Citi -- Analyst', ""OK. Thank you. And then I wanted to follow up on the prepared foods side, maybe going back to Peter Galbo's question, just on the new customer wins. Are there particular products that you're seeing these wins greatest in or particular channels within food service? Thanks."", 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Melanie.', 'Melanie Boulden -- Group President, Prepared Foods and Chief Growth Officer', ""So, Tom, your question was -- or I just want to make sure I'm clear. Are we -- are there particular products where we are seeing more success? Can you just repeat your question for me?"", 'Tom Palmer -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Yes. Sorry. Exactly. Just you noted some -- your growth was driven by some new customer wins and was just curious what products were really driving that for you right now and within prepared foods.', 'Thanks.', 'Melanie Boulden -- Group President, Prepared Foods and Chief Growth Officer', ""Yeah. So, I'd say that when I was talking about the customer expansion, we are making great strides in that area -- on the -- in that area on the food service side of the business. And then I would say, on the retail side of the business, we're seeing strong growth in distribution with our existing customers behind our core business lines, but we're also seeing excitement behind some of our -- a lot of our new innovation. And in particular, I want to highlight our Jimmy Dean Maple Griddle Cake that we launched last year to success."", 'And we are planning in a couple of months to launch an extension of that product item. Does that help, Tom?', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Tom, let me add --', 'Tom Palmer -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Yes. Thank you.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Let me add a little more color as it relates to food service there. As a reminder to everyone, in the middle of the pandemic, we had some operational issues being able to produce enough product for our customers and we essentially had to give up some business. And we've been, since the pandemic, trying to go and regain that. But we have a nice diversification between what are the traditionally quick service restaurants and as well as broad line distribution."", 'Tom Palmer -- Citi -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.', 'Michael Lavery -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Thank you. Good morning.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Michael Lavery -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""I want to come back to check in and just try to understand, you know, obviously, the lift in the quarter was cost- and margin-driven. But when you pointed to the strategic actions and those benefits, can you help us understand maybe how to think of them kind of longer term, and would this put you at the higher end or above, you know, kind of a 5% to 7% margin range? I know you're not wanting to think about margins as how you, you know, guide for the year. You gave a little bit of breadcrumbs for the second half. That's all really helpful."", ""But maybe just looking a little further out, is the business structurally different enough that, under normalized conditions, you would rethink what it's capable of, you know, what its earnings power is longer term?"", 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'So, let me start. This is Donnie. Let me start with a couple of points. And then I think John probably has a couple to add.', ""But, you know, in terms of being prepared to give guidance, we're not prepared to do that today and talk about that. But what I can tell you is what we're doing as a company. We talked about the third consecutive quarter of over $100 million of AOI improvement. In the midst of that, what I can also tell you is marketing, whether that's for grain or the meat side, those are largely offsetting one another."", ""So, the improvements are coming from operational improvements, operational excellence, both in plants and in live production, and really driving out waste from the business. But we also -- as we said earlier, we're realizing the benefits from plant closures that -- in terms of modernizing and rightsizing our footprint. So, we're seeing all of those. But this plan doesn't really -- is -- I mean, we've modeled the markets as they are today for the balance of the year, but this is all about operational excellence and then being more competitive and being better at what we do, at the same time, driving up raw material to more value-added and branded within the chicken segment."", 'John.', 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Donnie, it's a nice summary. I think, again, without touching on what the long-term outlook is like, the things I would point out about how the strategic moves we made have a sustaining impact in our business is a couple of things. First, you know, we're just taking cost out of the system while still keeping the same amount of volume with our customers. Over the long run, that means not putting capital into older and more tired assets, rather investing in those assets where we think we can, you know, achieve our target ROIC numbers."", ""And then I think the other thing, too, is we have really, in the last year, refocused our growth to be demand-backed and to be in those subcategories within the chicken segment where we see favorable trends from a growth and margin standpoint. So, I think, with that, over the long run, you know, we project to be competing and performing as a best-in-class chicken company from a margin standpoint. And that's how we realize that. I think the other big move that we made, we've seen it in our live performance results this year, is the switch from NAE to NAIHM."", ""And that's provided us for a lot more consistency in order to meet customer demands and expectations from a live standpoint."", 'Michael Lavery -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""OK. That's helpful. Great. And just a follow-up on prepared foods."", ""I understand it's obviously always competitive, and you touched on some of those dynamics, but can you give a sense on promotional levels? Would you say they're normalized again? Do you see increasing activity there? You know, you called out some of the mix headwinds was priced otherwise flat. Or, you know, I guess maybe could you dissect the price and mix pieces of that and just a sense of how the environment looks from a promotional perspective? Is it getting more intense or does it seem to have stabilized? What's your sense of how that looks?"", 'Melanie Boulden -- Group President, Prepared Foods and Chief Growth Officer', 'Yeah. So, this is Melanie. I would say that promotional activity is continuing. You know, we are continuing to see intense promotional activity.', ""In terms of how we are operating, we have, you know, our highest performing or highest ROI merchandising initiatives, you know, in place to drive our feature and display and choice at shelf, and we are seeing it working. But to your point, competitive activity in this area is strong, and we're just, you know, focused on controlling our controllables. And in addition to our promotional activity, we're focused on, as I said before, increasing our map investment to engage consumers. You know, again, we've got strong innovation in place and we're enhancing -- when you asked about price, we're making sure that we enhance our price pack architecture structure to address competitive pricing as well."", 'Michael Lavery -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'OK. Great. Thanks so much.', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.', 'Alexia Howard -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Good morning, everyone.', 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning, Alexia.', 'Alexia Howard -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""OK. So, two ones. Firstly, on the financial side, your leverage has obviously come down, but it sounds as though the -- whether there'll be more sequential improvement in operating income next quarter is TBD given the weather issues. Do you expect leverage to continue to come down from here or could next week -- next quarter be the high point?"", 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Alexia. So, I think two questions in there. The first off is just independent of whether -- I want to make sure we're tracking."", ""Independent of whether, you know, we expect our Q2 to typically be one of the softer quarters from a -- from an operating income standpoint. And so, then that's exacerbated by weather a little bit. In the long run, we are projecting for leverage to continue to come down. That's driven by a couple of things."", ""One, we're getting more efficient with working capital. We've talked about some inventory clearing in our -- around our segments. Exactly kind of where things happen in the first half of the year, we can say that we would expect to end our fiscal 2024 in a better net leverage position from a ratio standpoint than last year. That's evident, also, in, you know, our pull down on capex and what we projected, which is to be a better year from an operating income and EBITDA standpoint than '23."", ""So, that's -- we're trending in the right direction. Aggressively pursuing that at or around two times net leverage ratio. And we would project that we'll get to do that, continue to invest in our business, and also support our dividend from a capital allocation standpoint."", 'Alexia Howard -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Thank you. And then just as a follow-up on -- sticking with prepared foods, it sounds as though this mix shift into food service is obviously a good thing overall, but it is pushing the pricing down and potentially there might be a negative mix shift with margins. Are you able to clarify whether that price pressure will continue in future quarters, and are you able to talk about the margin differential between branded retail and food service and private label, which I assume is lower?', 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""OK. Alexia, this is Donnie. There are a lot of questions in there. Here's what I can tell you relative to food service, and keep this in mind."", ""We've talked about it today because you have seen some volume improvement relative to food service. I would remind you that we had given up some business in the middle of the pandemic and the nature of those contracts can be quite lengthy. And we're starting to get back in when those open up and get some volume. We have maintained in prepared foods to the capacity which produces those products."", ""So, if you think about it from that perspective, this overhead and these assets have been a drag on our business to some degree. We've got new volume to put into those assets. So, that's one piece of it. We're probably not going to talk about the differential and the margin structure between food service and retail, but it's important that we regain that volume in food service."", 'But our retail -- our iconic brands in retail, continuing to support those and grow those and innovate and do merchandising like Melanie has talked about before. Those are all still critical -- mission-critical for us.', 'Melanie Boulden -- Group President, Prepared Foods and Chief Growth Officer', ""Yeah. And the only thing, Alexia, I would like to add, because I think Donnie did a nice job of highlighting more of the top line, but also, as we think about our business and, you know, our performance, one of the reasons that we were able to deliver a solid quarter and what we plan on continuing to do is focus on our controllables, the things we can control, especially from an operational efficiency standpoint. So, you know, we're really, you know, focused on improving our service levels, maximizing our asset utilization by driving down our overhead, and increasing our yield and labor efficiencies. And importantly, we're driving automation to improve our supply chain execution."", ""So, from a top-line perspective, yes, your question was about mix, but I just wanted to reiterate that we're also working all levers of the P&L to ensure that we drive a strong bottom line as well."", 'Alexia Howard -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.', 'John R. Tyson -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Hey, before Donnie wraps this up, I just want to make sure we land one final point related to our outlook for 2024. And we've had a lot of great discussions this morning about our various segments. We obviously moved the range on chicken and on pork. But I just want to highlight our reaffirmation of the total company guidance from $1 billion to $1.5 billion."", ""Based on a lot of various macro factors and the interplay between all of our segments, I think we have reasons to believe while we could achieve a range of outcomes in that window, the midpoint, you know, plus or minus, we designed it that way for a reason and feels like a way to think about the total look. And then obviously, as we move through Q2 and through the balance of the year, we'll give any revisions as necessary. But cautiously optimistic, promising start to the year, but still a lot of factors at play around total protein availability, consumer sentiment, and other unpredictable factors that would get us to where we are. So, Donnie, I think with that, I'll hand it over to you."", 'Donnie King -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""OK.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.

Conversely, companies are generally averse to reducing dividends due to the negative impact it has on public perception. Therefore, when a company opts to increase its dividend, it typically indicates that the board believes the higher payout is sustainable and well-founded. In 2023, the S&P 500 set a new annual record by paying $70.30 per share, marking an increase from the $66.92 paid in 2022. The total payout to shareholders reached a record-breaking $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion, according to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices. The report further highlighted a quarterly increase in total dividends, with a rise from $16.3 billion in Q4 2022 to $17.5 billion."", ""The significance of this dividend payout figure becomes apparent when analyzing the performance of dividend stocks in 2023. The importance lies in the fact that dividend equities faced a challenging year in the preceding period, primarily due to the dominance of the tech rally, resulting in underperformance. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies that have consistently raised their dividend payments for the past 25 years, experienced a 5.7% increase in the previous year. This performance is notably lower when compared to the 26% gain in the S&P 500 total return index during the same period. However, analysts at Morgan Stanley are optimistic about the potential resurgence of dividend stocks in the current year. The decline in yields towards the end of 2023 is noted, and there is anticipation that they may further decrease if the Federal Reserve decides to reduce interest rates. Here is their statement in one of their investors' notes:"", '“Investors are seeking durable, higher yielding dividends as market volatility is expected to continue throughout the easing cycle.”', 'In addition to the strong outlook of dividend stocks, the historical performance of companies that consistently increase their dividends has demonstrated resilience and strength over the years. According to data from Morgan Stanley dating back to 2014, companies within the Russell 1000 index that chose to raise their dividends experienced an average outperformance of 3.1% in stock prices over the six months following the announcement of the increase.

The company plans to present more detailed results from both studies at upcoming medical meetings, and to engage with regulators about the path to approval in gMG."", 'Named nipocalimab, the drug has over the past year demonstrated what J&J calls “clinical efficacy” across four diseases caused by autoantibodies — a type of immune system foot soldier that attacks the body’s own proteins. Nipocalimab is among the most advanced in a new class of therapies that treat autoimmune disorders by blocking “FcRn,” a protein that keeps the most common antibody found in people from degrading.', 'In gMG, autoantibodies interrupt the communication between nerve cells and muscles, leading to muscle weakness in the eyes, face and limbs. J&J said that, in its study, patients on nipocalimab experienced a significant reduction in the severity of their symptoms over a roughly six-month period, compared to those who were given a placebo.', ""The same was true in the Sjögren's study, which J&J said was the first ever to test an anti-FcRn therapy against this condition and have positive results. Sjögren's is often characterized by dry eyes and mouth, though it can affect various organs like the kidneys and lungs as well as cause joint pain similar to arthritis. The National Institutes of Health estimate that between 1 million and 4 million people in the U.S. have the disease."", 'Together, the two trials could help build the case for a therapy J&J believes to be a possible blockbuster.

In gMG, meanwhile, it has cleared AstraZeneca’s Soliris and, in late 2021, Argenx’s Vyvgart — the first ever anti-FcRn medicine to get a nod from the agency. More recently, the FDA also greenlit AstraZeneca’s Ultomiris and UCB’s Zilbrysq and Rystiggo."", 'For J&J and its dealmakers, adding nipocalimab to that list would be validating, since the company spent $6.5 billion to acquire the drug’s former developer, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, in 2020.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.029. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

What are the catalysts ahead for this stock?"", ""ADRIENNE YIH: So, the catalysts are really, number one, that they absolutely have their inventory. So the supply side of things is unarguably fixed. And so that's half the battle, right? So they want to get to a pull market where their wholesale channel partners are ordering, replenishing, restocking from them. And that's a guaranteed plus to the revenue."", ""We don't think that's happening in the first half of the year at all. We already know that all the retailers are still buying down and very conservative. But you have to have a replenishment cycle of newness. And that's where the innovation comes in."", ""The catalysts are a whole slew of innovations coming for this year, the likes of which we haven't seen in two years. And I can go through those in a second. But that's really the two catalysts, innovation to drive top line, supply is tight."", ""BRAD SMITH: Adrienne, when you mentioned innovation, I was just reading in recently on that new Air Max Dn, that platform particularly, and it really seems interesting where-- for a shoe company that's had so much success with the retros that gets everybody clicking, that gets people going on to a sneakers app and crashing the dang thing all the time-- where they're balancing innovation and need to balance innovation with what people have just flocked to in the past. And so what is the correct way that investors should be grading the company on how they execute that?"", ""ADRIENNE YIH: They should be grading the company on what is new and the incremental unit newness, so what's going to get the consumer to spend the dollars on a new pair of shoes. I can appreciate the retro side of things, but that's been the problem with Adidas, with Vans, and with Nike."", ""They're selling the same things over and over. And it's getting quite frankly kind of boring. They sort of missed out on what I call the sole wars, like on Hoka, these high profile platforms. The Air Max Dn's coming in March, on Air Max Day, March 26th, mark your calendars. Right after that, they're going to have the Peg 41, the Pegasus 41, which is a whole new form factor. So, that's brand new. And then they're going to follow with Copa America in June and then the Paris Olympics."", ""All this is newness and innovation. And what I'll say is when you have the newness, the people don't immediately buy. But this is the first time we've seen kind of the leadership, led new by Heidi O'Neill, that is just focused on speed, hustle, at scale."", 'SEANA SMITH: Adrienne, what do you think the margin recovery story looks like-- and more specifically, you and I have talked so much just about the inventory levels with Nike. There has certainly been a lot of improvement over the last several quarters. But where do you think they stand as we look out towards year end in terms of that continued improvement that many analysts have been calling for?', ""ADRIENNE YIH: So fiscal year end for them is May. And this is a pretty anemic-- they just lowered guidance. Plus 1% top line sales. Consensus is looking for a 12.3% operating margin. That's below the 10-year average of 13%."", ""So this is-- so what we always say is they just got their inventory clean at the end of July, clearly at the end of November. It takes about two quarters for it to percolate into the system and run through the income statement and the margins. So we're seeing the back half of this calendar year."", ""But certainly, for FY '25, 150 to 200 basis points coming just from cleaning up the inventory, not spending money on storage, losses and damages, just all those kind of ghost inefficiencies and all the friction that comes with just being supply chain and inventory inefficient."", ""And so we haven't even put in the top line recovery. If we want to talk about top line recovery over the course of '25, '26, '27, we think there's probably 400 basis points. 200 in the near term from below the top line, another 200 basis points from leverage. So 12%, 13%, high teen margins over the next 2 to 3 years.""]"

He was booked under California penal code 496(a), which pertains to receiving stolen property.', 'With organized retail crime and retail theft ratcheting up across the state’s most populous cities and counties, Prop. 47, which raised the felony threshold for shoplifting to $950, has been thrust into the spotlight.

And last week, it Newsom saw the law’s effects in action.', 'At a press conference Wednesday with the mayors of California’s biggest cities, the governor shared an anecdote about a recent trip to the Target store in Sacramento where he witnessed shoplifting firsthand.', '“He picks it up and keeps walking out as we’re checking out,” the governor said, referencing a thief who exited the store without paying for merchandise. A retail worker at the register noted the incident but did not intervene. “’Oh, he’s just walking out—he didn’t pay for that,’” Newsom reported her saying.', '“Well, why don’t you stop him?” Newsom asked the employee. In response, she told him, “The governor lowered the threshold. There’s no accountability.”', ""“I said, ‘That’s just not true…Where’s your manager? How are you blaming the governor?’” he added. “I was like, ‘Why am I spending $380; everyone can walk the hell right out.'”"", 'The governor’s story garnered backlash on social media, with some detractors characterizing his comments as tone-deaf as he appeared to foist the blame for escalating retail theft on store employees.', 'California Republican Party chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson swiftly called out Newsom in a post on X. “Shoutout to this store clerk for saying to the governor’s face what every Californian has wanted to say: that he and his radical @CA_Dem buddies are to blame for CA’s surging crime. Sadly, Newsom still didn’t seem to take the hint,” she wrote.', 'Law enforcement officers across the state, including Sacramento Sheriff Jim Cooper, who personally responded to incidents at the Target location visited by Newsom this week, have fingered Prop. 47 for incentivizing repeat offenders. But Cooper told Sourcing Journal last fall that it’s a combination of “the law and the retailers sitting on their hands not doing anything” that has made California’s retail crime epidemic “1000 times worse.”', 'Many stores have implemented hands-off policies when it comes to shoplifters, ostensibly to protect retail workers from danger (and themselves from liability). And while a handful of recent bills have aimed to institute harsher penalties for retail theft, retailers aren’t throwing their weight behind these plans, Cooper said. A former state assembly member, the Sacramento Sheriff said it’s essential for retailers, especially big box stores like Target, to lend their support to legislative proposals if they are to gain traction.', 'But companies are often reticent when it comes to public policy, not wanting to alienate any segment of their consumer base. “Retailers have their fingers up to the political wind—when some new turmoil arises, maybe some reform issue comes up, they’re more worried about their image than doing what’s right for their customers or employees,” Cooper said.', '“There were bills put forth by the legislature that they did not support that would have changed things,” he added.']"

Vepdegestrant as a monotherapy is being studied in the ongoing Phase 3 VERITAC-2 clinical trial, which is evaluating vepdegestrant or fulvestrant in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer who have been previously treated with an endocrine-based therapy.', '""We are focused on the persisting unmet needs of people with ER+/HER2- breast cancer and doing all that we can to expedite the development of vepdegestrant as a novel, oral ER-targeted potential therapy for this patient community,” said John Houston, Ph.D., Arvinas Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer, and President. “We are pleased the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for vepdegestrant, and we continue to believe this investigational drug has the potential to harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to selectively and efficiently degrade and remove disease-causing proteins.""', '“The receipt of Fast Track designation reinforces the potential of vepdegestrant to provide an important new therapeutic option for people with ER+/HER2- breast cancer whose disease has progressed,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer. “We are proud to continue our legacy of developing innovative treatment options for people impacted by metastatic breast cancer and look forward to working with the FDA as we advance our development program for vepdegestrant.”', 'About Vepdegestrant (ARV-471) and its Clinical TrialsVepdegestrant is an investigational, orally bioavailable PROTAC protein degrader designed to specifically target and degrade the estrogen receptor (ER) for the treatment of patients with ER positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer.', 'In preclinical studies, vepdegestrant demonstrated up to 97% ER degradation in tumor cells, induced robust tumor shrinkage when dosed as a single agent in multiple ER-driven xenograft models, and showed increased anti-tumor activity when compared to a standard of care agent, fulvestrant, both as a single agent and in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In July 2021, Arvinas announced a global collaboration with Pfizer for the co-development and co-commercialization of vepdegestrant; Arvinas and Pfizer will equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses, and profits. Ongoing and planned clinical trials will continue to monitor and evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of vepdegestrant.', 'Vepdegestrant is currently being evaluated as a monotherapy in the second-line setting in the ongoing Phase 3 VERITAC-2 clinical trial and in the first-line setting in combination with palbociclib in the ongoing study lead-in cohort of the Phase 3 VERITAC-3 clinical trial. Vepdegestrant is also being evaluated for potential combination therapy with abemaciclib, ribociclib, samuraciclib, everolimus, and with Pfizer’s investigational novel CDK4 inhibitor, PF-07220060.', 'About ArvinasArvinas is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapies that degrade disease-causing proteins. Arvinas uses its proprietary PROTAC Discovery Engine platform to engineer proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTAC targeted protein degraders, that are designed to harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to selectively and efficiently degrade and remove disease-causing proteins. In addition to its robust preclinical pipeline of PROTAC protein degraders against validated and “undruggable” targets, the company has three investigational clinical-stage programs: ARV-766 and bavdegalutamide for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; and vepdegestrant (ARV-471) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer.

While there are countless strategies investors can employ to grow their nest egg in the stock market, buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks tends to be among the smartest ways to make money.', ""Last year, the Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, released a report that examined the power of dividend stocks over time. In particular, researchers examined the annualized performance of dividend stocks to nonpayers over the previous half-century (1973-2022). Whereas publicly traded companies that don't offer a payout delivered a modest annualized return of 3.95%, the dividend payers more than doubled up the nonpayers with a 9.18% annualized return."", ""Hartford Funds' findings on dividend stocks aren't a surprise. Companies that can generate a recurring profit, consistently share a percentage of that profit with their shareholders, and offer transparent long-term growth guidance, should be expected to rise in value over time."", ""The challenge for income seekers is maximizing the yield they receive while avoiding danger. Since risk and yield do tend to correlate, high-yielding stocks can sometimes be more trouble than they're worth. But this isn't always the case."", 'What follows are three magnificent ultra-high-yield dividend stocks -- sporting an average yield of 7.34% -- that are screaming buys in February.', 'The first unrivaled dividend stock that makes for a genius buy in the shortest month of the year is domestic tobacco giant Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Altria has raised its payout 58 times over the past 54 years.', ""There's no question that Altria's growth heyday is in the rearview mirror. Consumers have become increasingly aware of the potential dangers of long-term tobacco use, which has led to a precipitous downturn in adult cigarette smoking rates dating back to the mid-1960s. Whereas roughly 42% of U.S. adults smoked cigarettes in the mid-1960s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds that only 11.5% of adults were smokers as of 2021."", 'Though a shrinking pool of users would normally be the ultimate red flag for investors, Altria Group has two well-defined catalysts working in its favor.', 'As I noted somewhat recently, Altria possesses exceptional pricing power on its tobacco products. Tobacco contains nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. The addictive lure of nicotine makes smokers more willing to absorb price increases that outpace the prevailing rate of inflation. Even though aggregate cigarette shipments have been declining, Altria has the ability to modestly grow its sales by raising its prices.', ""I'll add to the above that it's a lot easier for Altria to raise its prices, compared to other cigarette producers, because of its dominant Marlboro brand. Marlboro closed out 2023 with a 42.1% share of the cigarette category. Smokers are willing to pay up for a premium brand they're familiar with."", ""The second catalyst for Altria is its push into smokeless products. A perfect example is its June 2023 acquisition of electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings. NJOY has received marketing granted orders (MGOs) for a half-dozen of its products from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. MGOs are effectively green lights for NJOY's e-vapor products to stay on retail shelves. The overwhelming majority of vape products in retail stores lack MGOs."", ""Valued at 8 times forward-year earnings and sporting a yield that's approaching 10%, Altria looks like a dividend investors' dream come true."", 'Perhaps no ultra-high-yield dividend stock embodies the idiom ""one man\'s trash is another man\'s treasure"" more so than pharmaceutical stock Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). With shares of the company once again nearing a 10-year low, its yield has ballooned to more than 6.2%.', 'The issue for Pfizer is that its COVID-19 tailwind has come and gone. Pfizer was one of the few companies to successfully develop a COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty), as well as an oral treatment (Paxlovid) to lessen symptoms of the illness. After generating more than $56 billion in combined sales from Comirnaty and Paxlovid in 2022, Pfizer is forecasting only a combined $8 billion from these two blockbusters in the current year.', ""While this might feel like letting air out of the tire on a car, let me be perfectly clear that none of Pfizer's proverbial tires are flat."", ""On an apples-to-apples basis, which excludes the company's COVID-19 treatments, Pfizer's remaining portfolio of dozens of approved therapies grew by 7% in 2023, with double-digit growth from its Specialty Care segment. Pfizer's portfolio, sans COVID-19 treatments, is expected to grow by another 3% to 5% in 2024."", ""Furthermore, Pfizer's share price was punished after its admission in December that its acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen would result in a one-time hit of $0.40 per share for its 2024 earnings. Looking more than 12 months out, Pfizer anticipates cost synergies from this deal, as well as a considerably more robust portfolio of high-margin cancer therapies."", ""Investors would also be wise to note that the healthcare sector is highly defensive. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy performs, people still need prescription medicines and healthcare services. In short, Pfizer's operating cash flow tends to be predictable in any economic climate."", 'Lastly, the valuation makes a lot of sense. Investors can scoop up shares of Pfizer right now for less than 10x forward-year earnings and a mere 2.5x estimated sales in the current year.', ""The third magnificent ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's a screaming buy in February is telecom company Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ)."", 'Legacy telecom providers have been hit with a bit of a double whammy over the past two years. The fastest rate-hiking cycle by the Federal Reserve in four decades could make future debt-financed deals and refinancing costlier.', 'The other issue for Verizon is the July report from The Wall Street Journal that alleges lead-sheathed cables still in use by legacy telecom companies could lead to environmental and health liabilities, as well as lofty replacement costs.', ""However, Verizon responded to the WSJ report by noting only a small percentage of its network utilizes lead-clad cables. It also noted that testing of its lead-sheathed cables is underway. The key point being that any potential liability for telecom companies would be determined by the U.S. court system. This is typically a multiyear process and doesn't pose any threat to telecom companies in the short run."", ""What investors should be focused on is Verizon's modest but steady growth propelled by the 5G revolution. Upgrading its network to handle faster download speeds is encouraging users to consume more data. Data happens to be where Verizon's wireless segment generates its juiciest margins."", ""The other key driver for Verizon is its broadband segment. Being able to offer 5G download speeds to residential customers has helped the company add at least 400,000 net broadband users for five consecutive quarters. Even though broadband isn't the growth driver it was two decades ago, it's good for an uptick in operating cash flow and has been known to encourage high-margin service bundling."", ""Let me also add that wireless service and internet access have become basic necessities. Consumers are highly unlikely to cancel these services, which makes Verizon's cash flow quite predictable year after year."", ""As with Altria and Pfizer, Verizon's valuation is attractive. Shares can be scooped up for less than 9x forward-year earnings, which provides a safe floor and modest upside for patient investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Altria Group wasn’t one of them.

Undoubtedly, PayPal is very much in the AI race after the not-so-surprising announcements that were quick to be shot down by analysts and investors alike. The firm is still a legit underdog in the so-called AI race, even if its recent AI-driven features failed to generate hype right off the bat.', 'Though PayPal may not be standing nearly as tall as its peers in the mega-cap tech scene, some of whom have far more ambitious AI plans, I still believe it’s a mistake to count PayPal out of the game as it looks to get its share price back on the right track.', 'Indeed, nothing seems to be working for PayPal these days. The stock likely lost a ton of confidence when it shed more than 80% of its value since its mid-2021 peak at just north of $300 per share. After such a catastrophic implosion, investors don’t seem to be buying into the firm’s turnaround potential.', 'Whether we’re talking PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin offering in the crypto universe, the recent layoff of 9% of its staff, or the latest AI plans, it seems like the firm is really trying to put its hand in many pies to win back some of the investors it had lost over the last two and a half years. For now, it doesn’t seem like they’re coming back. However, if PayPal can continue innovating on the front of AI, perhaps it can shock the world at a later date.', 'In any case, the recent AI announcements seem to have set a pretty low bar. And whenever you’ve got a low bar, it makes it easier to overdeliver. In many ways, PayPal stock seems like dead money, but at these depressed multiples (shares go for 18.6 times trailing price-to-earnings right now), I believe the stakes haven’t been this low in quite a while. As such, I’m inclined to be bullish on the stock.', 'There’s no shortage of analysts who weren’t shocked in the slightest following the company’s presentation centered on AI tech. Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev is one of the analysts who was unenthused by the event, going as far as to say the firm’s intent of “doubling down on Branded Checkout may prove a long-term regret.”', 'With the negative initial reaction in the stock to PayPal’s six AI-powered initiatives, it certainly seems like the tough crowd has gotten a heck of a lot tougher, even with the much lower price of admission on shares.', 'Of the six new AI features, which include an enhanced checkout, Smart Receipts, Fastlane (one-click), CashPass, Advanced Offers, and Upgraded Venmo Business, none really stood out to me as a massive game-changer. Indeed, any one of PayPal’s rivals could leverage AI in a way to do many of the same things in the future. At this juncture, it seems like the crowd is inclined to believe that anything PayPal can do, mega-cap tech (think the Magnificent Seven members) can do better, especially when it comes to AI.', 'While Branded Checkout may prove to be somewhat regretful, as Mr. Dolev pointed out, I think the upgraded Venmo Business profiles feature holds the most potential of all six recently announced AI initiatives. Indeed, Venmo is a robust platform with many loyal users to whom PayPal can showcase new tech.', 'Any new innovation that can make the lives of users (especially business users) easier will increase brand loyalty. I firmly believe that adding value (through AI or not) will allow the company to more easily increase its pricing over time.', 'Over the long run, such convenience updates could add up and help bolster the Venmo (and PayPal) ecosystem in a way that makes it harder to jump ship over to a competing payment service provider.', 'Understandably, it will take some time before investors warm up to the recent AI initiatives, perhaps when the AI bets start resulting in actual cash flows — something that may happen a lot sooner than the skeptics and bears expect.', 'On TipRanks, PYPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 30 analyst ratings, there are 14 Buys and 16 Hold recommendations. The average PYPL stock price target\xa0is $71.60, implying upside potential of 16.35%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $57.00 per share to a high of $101.00 per share.', 'I don’t think it’s fair for investors to punish PayPal for its recent AI-heavy event. While it may not have showcased the most ground-breaking features on the planet, I do believe PayPal is on the right track. And over time, the firm certainly has the ability to enrich its offering further as it welcomes AI with open arms.', 'Disclosure']"

We don't need rate cuts or do we? Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool analyst Bill Barker. Bill, how's your Thursday going?"", ""Bill Barker: It's going great. Thanks for asking."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well Bill, I'm here with you to talk a little macro today. Yesterday it was a Powell day. We had Fed Chair Jerome Powell's conference yesterday. No interest rate change that was expected but we are now, I would call it on cut watch. Powell has said he's prepared to keep the ship steady, keep things where they are for now. Market didn't love that. It's shaking it off today, but should we have really been surprised and why not just cut the rates?"", ""Bill Barker: I think because you can't have your cake and eat it too. That's what the market wants and always wants and that's what the rest of us all want too is to have it all. But you can't maybe have the GDP going along at above 4% growth, which it was on the second half of last year. The forecast on GDP now is not a lot of data yet in for Q1 but projected at above 4% by the Atlanta Feds model anyway. The growth is fine, inflation has come down, but is not at the target rate. The employment picture continues to be excellent. Why would you change what has been working? Which one of those things is the problem and the minor problem is that inflation is not yet at 2% to about 3%. The reason to have had all the interest rate hikes was to address inflation and the job is not quite done yet."", ""Deidre Woollard: Powell has been very clear every time he says 2% a lot. We know that's important to him. But on the other side, before the beginning of the year everybody sits around and says, we're going to have six cuts. We're going to have seven cuts. It's going to start in March. Well, it's starting to look like maybe it's not going to start in March. If the forecast for interest rate cuts shifts, everybody's models, everybody's forecast shifts. I'm wondering about some of the companies that were really betting on that rate to go down so that they can restructure some debt. If the cuts don't happen till maybe June, how does that impact all of the companies that were really planning on it being March?"", ""Bill Barker: Well, if they really need interest rates to come down by 25 basis points or 50 basis points in the first half of this year, then they're not very good companies."", 'Deidre Woollard: Good point.', ""Bill Barker: The Fed has never indicated that they're going to be that many rate cuts. That's people hoping there will be that many rate cuts. Why are they hoping? There has to be some element, I think of a weakening and more rapidly weakening economic picture to get that many rate cuts. I don't know what the equation is that gets everything that you would want and six rate cuts, it's not going to happen. The Fed's telling you it's not going to happen."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, yeah, the Fed's telling you it's not going to happen. People still say, it might happen. But if I think if it does happen, then we're in a position where perhaps we don't want to be. You made a really good point there that I just want to emphasize is that the companies that really need this to happen, those are probably the zombie companies that maybe have too much debt anyway. They've got a bigger problem than just waiting on Powell."", ""Bill Barker: If you have in any way structured your company or your own finances in a way that requires interest rates to get back down to something approximately zero or very low rates, then you've got to rethink what you've done because that was the anomaly of a 5% range for the Fed is not some weird thing. It's much more historically repeated than this is a near zero rate level that we enjoyed. I get everybody wants to enjoy borrowing money for free. I would love to do that too, but it's not going to happen."", ""Deidre Woollard: No. That was definitely an anomaly. Part of this is also the soft landing. I'm so sick of talking about the soft landing, but we have to do it. It's a delicate dance because you need the solid labor market, but not too solid because that's not so great either, and that can lead to inflation, which we're trying to get back down to that 2%. Looking at the hiring market, it was a rough January, it seemed to me, not as rough as last year according to one report that I saw. But it definitely was the second highest layoff total according to this report from Challenger Gray in Christmas and lowest hiring outlook since 2009. Good for soft landing. But as I watch big companies that I respect and invest in, do some deep cuts, I'm thinking about what's happening here. We had two just this morning. Octa is cutting 7% of their staff. Deutsche Bank is cutting about 3,500 jobs. When we see all these layoffs and we're looking at this soft landing, how do you balance all of that?"", ""Bill Barker: Well, those are headlines and those are real numbers and those are real tragedies for the people who are suffering the job cuts. But on the other side, we don't see all the job hiring which ends up producing these monthly numbers, which have been reasonably consistent at about 200,000 jobs added a month over most of last year. Now the employment market has softly landed 200,000 a month is roughly what we were tracking at pre-pandemic and for several years preceding that, it's really pretty close to that range. Of course, at the very beginning, 20 some million jobs were lost and there was much higher rates, monthly rates of people returning to work. The employment market was having 4 or 5, 6, 700,000 jobs a month added, it's come down to 200,000 I would say it has softly landed. Whereas inflation has softly climbed down, it has not yet landed. Two percent is the landing spot, it's announced. It precedes all of this. It hasn't changed. After 2% is achieved, then maybe there's time to revisit. Hey, it doesn't need to be, 2% is 2-2.5%, is two and a quarter, two and three quarters percent. All good. But until you've achieved 2% you're not going to declare the landing achieved. I think we'll get new monthly employment numbers tomorrow and those will not reflect these most recent announced job cuts but, it's expected to be a positive number again, if it's the first month since 2019 or late 2020 where there were jobs lost in a month, and that will affect the probability of that interest rate cut happening a little bit quicker."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I think there's also another thing that I'm thinking about here is the last couple of years have been breathlessly watching each meeting. The transcripts are getting scrutinized. I'm hoping that if there is less activity, maybe it takes a while for the cuts, maybe his conference has become a little more what I feel they should be, which is regular, steady as she goes, non-events. If that happens, do you think that that will tamp down that volatility that we have seen in the last couple of years? Every time he speaks, the market does these gyrations."", ""Bill Barker: I think there are algorithms that are in part responsible for that. You see the market having recovered quite a bit today as we speak compared to what it lost after the news came out. The volatility has been largely within one or 2% and quickly recovered, at least in this case because the almost everything that you can look at for the economic picture is doing very well. The ability of the narrative that the economy is in trouble or it's about to hit recession. Obviously there are some political points that are trying to be gained by pushing that narrative but it's not the case."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, let's move away from the macro and into the specific. We've got big things to look forward to after market closed today with some earnings that I'm sure Dylan and the crew are going to talk about on tomorrow's show. But I want to take a look at one they reported this morning. It's Peloton and listeners know me. I love to listen to an earnings call. The Peloton call felt a little defeated. The numbers weren't bad, they're trimming some losses. That's awesome. But you've got the CEO that came along to turn it around, Barry McCarthy, and the turn just isn't quite turning. The market doesn't like gloom. They responded poorly to that. Are you watching this one at all? What do you think?"", ""Bill Barker: I'm not watching it because it's essentially a consumer electronics company and that's a poor place to find good long term returns. It's not a well run company. It has not been. That's not McCarthy's fault. He came in and found this company that needed to downsize dramatically and reverse heavy losses. The heavy losses have been reversed, but it's not really making money. I don't want to stomp on a company that's already, suffered 198% declines from the high in its stock. So it's a consumer electronics company that doesn't have a differentiating factor that makes it interesting."", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm going to push back there because I'm not entirely sure it's a consumer electronics company because I feel like it's a membership company. Originally, totally consumer electronics and the instructors. But as time goes on, it's more of a membership. It's more of a not quite a social media but it or a streaming, but it's got a taste of that. They have the recent deal with TikTok. I feel like there's something here in terms of the membership, but I also see that their churn rate is up over 7%. I'm wondering about that, but is the future of it more as a service than as a consumer electronics company?"", ""Bill Barker: Let's say it's a membership company. It's got to take members from other similar offerings, gyms, and that doesn't dramatically grow. There was a vision, a belief during COVID that everybody's life was going to change and was going to revolve around in-home athletic exercise. But that hasn't really been the case, at least as experienced by Peloton. It's not a value company because it's not earning money, it's not a growth company because it's still seeing declining revenue and it's a company that hasn't offering that many people love. The people who love it have probably largely found it by now. I don't know what's going to make a difference for all the people who haven't tried it or who tried it and left. I don't see what they have to offer that isn't largely available from many other places."", ""Deidre Woollard: I think one of the things I'm going to watch with the vision Po is to see what Apple does with fitness. Because, It's an interesting thing because you had Lulu Lemon tried to do that by buying the mirror. There's definitely companies of trying to figure out the future of virtual fitness and a lot of different swings are being taken so it's interesting, but I want to talk to you about one other thing. This is something I'm like puzzling around in my mind lately, which with Peloton I knew a lot of people got super intuit before the pandemic during and they talked about their Peloton streak all the time and the word streak I hear everywhere lately, so people have dual lingo streaks. Snapchat teenagers very worried about losing the streak. You've got people with Wordle streaks that you have this anxiety about that, but also love it. It's what drives the huge growth of the games at New York Times. Everybody's like a lot of businesses are banking on this streak trend. But every time I see a trend, I get like, when's this trend going to end? Are you a person who have anything in your life that you have a streak on and do you feel like this is a trend that's continuing to grow?"", ""Bill Barker: I don't know, waking up, eat, eating drinking coffee, I think I don't."", 'Deidre Woollard: What coffee streak.', ""Bill Barker: One of my streak is on drinking coffee. But I'd put it up against everybody basically. I get it and if you need a psychiatrist or a neurologist to explain why that is such an effective motivating factor in the psyche. But look, this is the most common New Year's resolution is to get started on exercising and to maintain it and it's the most easily dropped. Great for people who have any healthy streak including using Peloton, if they can leverage that to get people to lead healthier lives.

Now will you actually get paid later here to check in on the status of buy now, pay later products is Motley Fool contributor Matt Frankel. Matt, thanks for joining me today.', ""Matt Frankel: Hey Mary, thanks for having me. I'm glad to be here."", ""Mary Long: Glad to have you. I was surprised to learn that BNPL lenders have actually been around for a decade. I think that surprise largely came from the fact that 2020 and 2021 really stick out of my mind as like the peak moment for BNPL. Yet we're in a different moment now, Klarna in 2021, which it's privately traded, but it was valued at $45.6 billion in 2021. Now it's not at its lows, but it's still a far cry from that big number. Its most recent valuation placed the company at $7.85 billion. A firm stock followed a similar story. It's risen above its 2023 lows, but it's still pretty distant from that 2021 high. Where are we in the BNPL hype cycle?"", ""Matt Frankel: The hype surrounding the stocks has certainly died down. But you could say that about pretty much every other fintech company, not just by now, pay later. If you look at PayPal, Block, they're all trading it, 80% less than their all time highs during the peak of the hype. But the business wise, I don't know if it's fair to call by now pay later hype because more people than ever are using it, just looking at a firm's recent numbers because they're publicly traded, it's really easy to get a read on the industry through them. Almost 17 million active customers, 28% more merchandise volume in the fiscal first quarter than a year ago. Their revenue was up by 37%. Their margins are looking good. More people than ever are using this buy now pay later as a concept is clearly here to stay you know whether or not the stocks are going to reward. That is another matter."", ""Mary Long: Let's just hone in and Affirm because you mentioned that their biggest competitors aren't solely in the buy now pay later space. There's Apple PayPal even after pay, which is owned by Block. They've all got their hands in different products as well. Based on what you were just saying about a firm and how it's growing over time, is buy now pay later viable as a stand-alone business? Or is it most successful when it's offering other products as well?"", ""Matt Frankel: There's advantages to both. But I would actually make the argument that a stand-alone business is best for buy now pay later. I would use PayPal as an example there. Because when you think of PayPal, they're not the only company that was doing online checkout and payment processing and things like that. But they were the big peer play that was laser focused on it. Now there's a PayPal checkout button on every website you visit. It's a stand-alone payment processor as opposed to some of the other ones. That allowed it to really leverage its relationship. Say we're all in on this and build a network and we're seeing that with a firm. A firm checkout is now available on Amazon it's on Walmart in the store. You can do a firm check out in a lot of locations."", 'Matt Frankel: So I would argue that the stand-alone model is actually an advantage for Affirm, as opposed to some of those others that you mentioned.', 'Mary Long: Affirm\'s self-stated goal is to deliver, ""Honest financial products that improve lives."" What outside of buy now, pay later, does Affirm, and even Klarna for that matter, what else do they offer?', ""Matt Frankel: Affirm's offering me Affirm card now which they call the future of the business. It's essentially a credit card product that gives you certain options to pay overtime, pay in four installments, things like that. The four installments is 0% interest is the big differentiator, but you can't treat it as a regular credit card. They want to offer a high yield savings account, which I'm not totally sold on if I'm being honest. But the Affirm card is a really interesting product. It's a pretty small part of the business right now, but it's a higher margin product, 86% of its loans are interest bearing, which is not the general makeup of Affirm. It made up only 4% of its merchandise volume in the most recent quarter, but accounted for 7% of its revenue. So as debt grows, that could be really interesting. Does it improve people's lives? That's a tough argument to make when you're talking about something that puts people into debt but it can make financial lives easier. I'd buy that story."", ""Mary Long: I think it's easy to focus on like the dangers of buy now pay later. This phantom debt and people not fully realizing the debt that they're in. The lack of regulation in the space maybe compared to credit card companies. But Affirm CEO, Max Levichen, really seems to have like a strong mission driven vision for the company that hits on the making lives better piece. What is that vision? Like do you find that compelling?"", ""Matt Frankel: Yes and no. Like I said, the savings account side of it, I really don't but that's a crowded space already and there are a lot of fintechs that do it very well and have trouble gaining traction as it is. So that part of the business, I'm not that sold on. The Affirm card does open up a lot of interesting possibilities just because when you think of what Affirm's normally used for. Before we recorded this, I mentioned my wife used it to buy a Peloton. It's historically been used for big ticket items like that. This opens it up to certain verticals that were not part of its ecosystem before. Say, restaurants, say spending on groceries. If you have a big grocery purchase, and say you're hosting Thanksgiving dinner, you could split it into four payments. That's an area that wasn't historically part of the buy now, pay later landscape. So I do find that compelling. I don't really focus as much on the dangers of debt because the numbers tell us not to. The whole reason that Affirm, and all the other ones, tanked in 2022, 2023, was there was this fear that we were going to see this surge in delinquencies, because of all this phantom debt, and because their credit underwriting standards aren't as high as everyone else's and things like that. But what I think the market missed is that they underwrite based on a single purchase, not just a blanket credit line. It's a totally different ball game to assess whether somebody is going to make the payments on their Peloton bike, then to just give them a $10,000 line of credit. I think that's what the market got wrong and the numbers are showing that. Not only have Affirm's delinquency rates not exceeded pre pandemic levels yet, they're below what we're seeing from most credit card companies. Sofi which is known for having very affluent clients in high credit score and things like that, their loan delinquency rate is a full percentage point above Affirm's. So that's one thing that I found really interesting in the data because it's turning out not to be terrifying type of debt, that's people are financing one purchase and then paying for it."", ""Mary Long: Affirm's been growing customers steadily, but like you've mentioned at Walmart, at Amazon, there are different payment options available. So is there any real stickiness to Affirm in particular, or if Klarna is also offered? What's stopping me from switching between the two?"", ""Matt Frankel: Well, it's all about exclusive partnerships. I mentioned Peloton. Peloton can't offer Klarna as a checkout option because, it's an Affirm customer. When I go to check out online, I see a PayPal button. They have exclusive agreements with a lot of merchants and Affirm is doing a great job of leveraging that. So the product itself is a commodity. Any type of credit is a commodity, that's why Visa, and Mastercard, and American Express, they charge roughly the same swipe fees to merchants and why Block and Ad Yun and all of them charge the same payment processing fees to merchants, because there's no real big differentiators. It's all about exclusive relationships and who gets the better exclusive relationships because they offer the more compelling products and the best functionality and things like that. So that's what Affirm has been doing to differentiate itself is really improving its functionality. Compared Pierce, I can't tell you where I could go pay with Afterpay right now. I have absolutely no idea but I could tell you 10 websites where I could go pay with Affirm."", ""Mary Long: So I want to get to Afterpay too. But before we do that, just let's stick on Affirm for one second. It's not yet profitable, but it did produce positive operating income for the first time for the last two quarters. The company reports earnings on February 8. We're recording this on January 31. What are you looking for?"", ""Matt Frankel: I'm watching that delinquency rate, I mentioned that the delinquency rate, it's reverted back to the pre pandemic normals. It's 30 day delinquency rate is 3.2%. Right now it was 3.3% in 2019, so no sign of trouble yet. That could change we're just coming off of the crucial holiday spending quarter, so that tends to be a seasonally very busy time of year for Affirm, and people if they do get in over their heads in debt, it happens during the holidays, a lot of people could tell you that. I'm watching the delinquency rate really closely, but if they can keep that low, this will be a profitable business. It's just it's a matter of time, but that's still a big if at this point, it hasn't really been tested in a recession or anything like that."", 'Mary Long: So you teased out Afterpay for a minute there, Block acquired the company in February 2022 for $29 billion, hinted at this, but how has that turned out for Block so far?', ""Matt Frankel: Well, just to clarify because people are just listening to this. I did just roll my eyes when you said Afterpay and Block in the acquisition, they clearly overpaid for it. The short answer is the acquisition has turned out OK. It is a positive contributor to the company's numbers. They broke out the numbers in the third quarter which is the most recent we have data for. Afterpay generated $129 million of revenue in the third quarter for Block 94 million of that was gross profit, so a pretty strong margin there. That's about 5% of the total of the company that didn't really justify that price tag. But to be fair, it was an all stock deal they paid for Afterpay in stock, not cash. So they didn't actually pay $29 billion. If you look at Block share price today, it was closer to 8 billion, that they actually ended up paying in terms of the value of the stock. But they clearly overpaid for what this business is bringing to the table. I think it makes their ecosystem stronger. Does it make it $8 billion stronger no?"", 'Mary Long: Thinking about buying out pay later companies and their competition maybe with credit cards. Are there any pure play BNPL companies that you see as being ripe for acquisition by a bigger player, perhaps a credit card company?', ""Matt Frankel: That's tough. I think Klarna would be the easiest just because it's a private company and there's a lot more wiggle room there when it comes to a deal. Right now, Affirm's market value is about $13 billion. So realistically, someone would have to pay like $17-20 billion to acquire it. I don't see it happening, but it's not out of the question. Paypal has been trying to break into buying out pay later forever. They have $11.5 billion of cash on their balance sheet and the ability to borrow money pretty deeply. A big tech company like Alphabet that has been trying to build out its Fin tech offerings could be a good fit for Affirm if its numbers keep going in the right direction and if it really proves that this business model can survive no matter what the economy is doing. So I don't want to say ripe for acquisition just because I do think that's a steep price tag to pay. I think there is an after pay effect in the market, if you will, where companies are worried about how much it's actually going to contribute to their bottom line. But Affirm, I think people would be buying their relationships more than anything else. It would be very valuable, especially to a company that's struggling to figure out the next step like a Paypal."", ""Mary Long: Some of the bigger players in this space, the more diversified players, Apple Paypal. They've been experimenting with this for a while, but if you're a Visa or Mastercard, you're a massive company. Are you threatened at all by these buy now, pay later companies or do you think that they see this as technology that they themselves could replicate if they really wanted to?"", ""Matt Frankel: It depends how much they end up leaning into the card products because to be able to use the Affirm card at any retailer, it has to be a Visa or Mastercard product. So if the future of Affirm and the future of buy now, pay later are card based products like Affirm's management seems to think, then they're a help to Visa and Mastercard. They're not a competitor. Right now buy now, pay later is a competitor because you're getting around the traditional credit card or anything like that system. But if the Affirm card really starts to gain traction in other similar card products, start to gain traction, that's a net positive for Visa and Mastercard. Not a negative."", 'Mary Long: Matt, thanks so much for taking the time to talk through this with me today. Really interesting space to keep an eye on.', ""Matt Frankel: Of course, we could talk by up pay later for an hour and we did it in 13 minutes, so that's pretty awesome."", ""Mary Long: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy, sell stocks based solely on what you hear I'm Deidre Woollard.

Microsoft's stock skyrocketed 986% as it successfully expanded its mobile, cloud, AI, and gaming segments."", ""When we look at those growth trajectories, we might assume that Microsoft is still a better overall investment than IBM. However, past performance is a poor indicator of future gains, and IBM is showing flickers of life again as its revenue growth stabilizes. Over the past month, IBM's share prices jumped 16%, while Microsoft's stock climbed 11%."", ""Both companies recently impressed investors with their latest earnings reports, but could IBM's lower valuation and turnaround potential actually make it a better buy than Microsoft? Let's take a fresh look at both tech giants to decide."", ""From 2014 to 2021, IBM's annual revenue dropped from $92.8 billion to $57.4 billion. That precipitous decline was caused by the sluggish growth of its business software, hardware, and IT services segments; its inability to expand in the booming cloud market; and a series of big divestments aimed at raising fresh cash and streamlining the company. IBM also relied too much on wasteful stock buybacks to boost its earnings per share."", ""But after IBM's cloud chief, Arvind Krishna, became its CEO in 2020, it made three sweeping changes. First, it spun off its slow-growth managed infrastructure services unit as Kyndryl in November 2021. Second, it developed more hybrid cloud and AI services that could be positioned between private and public clouds. That strategy enabled it to profit from the growth of the cloud market without going toe-to-toe against public cloud leaders like Amazon and Microsoft."", 'Finally, IBM restructured its business into three simpler units (software, consulting, and infrastructure) and set a goal for generating ""sustainable mid-single digit revenue growth"" from 2022 to 2024. Its revenue rose 6% in 2022 and 2% in 2023, and analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 3% and 5%, respectively, in 2024.', ""Those stable growth rates indicate IBM's turnaround efforts are paying off, but its stock still trades at 19 times forward earnings and pays a forward yield of 3.6%. That low valuation and high yield are turning Big Blue into a safe-haven stock again -- and that reputation might just help it outperform the market this year if interest rates stay elevated."", 'From fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Microsoft\'s revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11%, from $77.8 billion to $211.9 billion. That growth can mainly be attributed to Satya Nadella, the company\'s former cloud chief who became its CEO in February 2014 and guided its transformation into a ""mobile first, cloud first"" business.', ""Under Nadella, Microsoft expanded Azure into the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS), transformed most of its desktop software into stickier cloud-based services, developed iOS and Android versions of its apps, and beefed up its Xbox gaming business with the acquisitions of several major publishers and the development of its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming platforms.

The main factor fueling the double-digit rise in the refining stock was its strong fourth-quarter results. The company also plans to trim its investment spending this year, which would, depending on market conditions, increase its free cash flow and ability to return money to shareholders. ', ""Marathon Petroleum reported its fourth-quarter and full-year results near the end of January. The refining company delivered $1.5 billion, or $3.84 per share, of adjusted net income in the year's final quarter. While that was down from $3.3 billion, or $7.09 per share, from the year-ago period, it significantly exceeded the analysts' consensus estimate that it would earn $2.21 per share. The company also beat analysts' expectations for revenue ($36.8 billion versus $34.9 billion). "", 'That capped a solid year for the refiner as it overcame pricing volatility to produce solid earnings and cash flow. Marathon Petroleum earned $9.7 billion while generating $14.1 billion in net cash provided by operating activities for the year. That strong cash flow supported its hefty cash returns, which totaled $12.8 billion in dividends and share buybacks last year. ', ""Marathon can afford to return so much cash to investors because it has a cash-rich balance sheet (It ended the year with $10.2 billion of cash, equivalents, and short-term investments). Meanwhile, its business doesn't require much capital to sustain and expand its operations. Marathon expects its capital spending to be about $1.25 billion this year, down roughly 4% from 2023's level. That capital spending level doesn't include the $1.1 billion budget outlook of its affiliated master limited partnership (MLP) MPLX. "", ""About 65% of Marathon's capital budget (roughly $825 million) will be on growth-related projects to enhance its margins and reduce costs. It's investing to improve the competitiveness of its Los Angeles refinery, including modernizing utility systems and increasing energy efficiency. It expects to complete those projects at the end of next year. Meanwhile, it's building a 90,000-barrel-per-day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater at its Galveston Bay refinery. That project will enable it to produce more higher-value refined products when it comes online by the end of 2027. In addition, the company's MLP is investing $1.1 billion into projects to grow its operations in the Marcellus and Permian basins. "", ""As Marathon Petroleum demonstrated last year, it's a cash-flow machine. Its cash flow could be even stronger this year, given its reduced capital spending outlook and increased distributions from its high-yielding MLP (MPLX increased its payout by another 10% late last year). These factors could supply the refiner with more money to return to investors this year through dividends and repurchases. Those strong cash returns could give it the fuel to continue generating attractive total returns even after rallying last month.

This followed the company\'s 2022 decision to cut 20% of its staff, in addition to smaller cuts last year.', 'And in doing so, Snap made the easiest decision available to every tech company today — trim head count, cut costs, and frame it as offering flexibility to invest tomorrow.', 'This logic invoked by Snap and so many others during head count reductions holds water because it is plainly true. The tech industry at large underwent an enormous hiring binge during the pandemic, and many dynamics these investments were designed to target have either cooled off or never materialized.', 'Cutting costs to ensure future flexibility, by this logic, just makes business sense. According to data from layoffs.fyi, job cuts in the tech industry this year now total more than 32,000, with giants ranging from Microsoft (MSFT) to PayPal (PYPL) and eBay (EBAY) all participating.', 'But the trend to cut jobs started by Big Tech firms a year ago has spread throughout the corporate world and almost come to require that management teams find a way to participate.', 'Estée Lauder (EL) stock rose 12% after the beauty giant announced its own workforce reduction on Monday. Companies ranging from Xerox (XRX) to UPS (UPS) have also made deep cuts to their employee bases this year.', 'The stock market is clearly indicating that management teams have an incentive to participate.', 'And the overall US labor market climate — one in which a regular drumbeat of white-collar job cuts is contrasted by strong overall job growth — offers additional cover for leaders to make these calls.', ""Because not only are you matching the industry's ebbs and flows by cutting staff, but you're doing so in a labor market that, in the aggregate, suggests there remains plenty of demand for these workers' services elsewhere."", 'Back in March 2023, we argued the wave of tech-related job cuts and the swift demise of Silicon Valley Bank taken together showed how the tech industry moves in a tight pack, riding the same currents.', ""The corporate strategy playbook being used outside the confines of this industry in 2024 shows the inclination to follow is a stronger and deeper force in corporate America than we'd previously given credence."", 'Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks', 'Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance']"

(NYSE:GM) have moved sharply higher over the past three months, delivering a total return of nearly 40%. The stock has benefited from a number of positive developments, including an end to the UAW strike against the company, a massive accelerated share repurchase program and strong 2024 guidance provided by management.', ""While a significant number of shares have already been delivered under the ASR, the banks managing the program still have a significant number of shares which need to be repurchased to complete the program. Consensus fiscal 2024 estimates remain well below the company's recent guidance, which sets the automaker up to potentially deliver better-than-expected earnings per share for the year. Additionally, despite the recently rally, the stock trades at under 5 times forward earnings compared to an average price-earnings ratio of 6.80 over the past few years. For these reasons, I believe GM shares can continue to move higher from current levels."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with GM.', 'GM Data by GuruFocus', ""On Nov. 29, GM announced a $10 billion ASR program that represented about 25% of the company's shares outstanding at the time. On Dec. 1, the company advanced $10 billion to a group of banks and received approximately 215 million shares of stock with a value of $6.80 billion. Thus, these shares were repurchased at a price of roughly $31.60 per share. Final settlement of the transaction is expected to occur no later than Dec. 31, 2024. By this time, the banks managing the ASR will be required to deliver GM roughly an additional $3.20 billion worth of shares. The repurchase price will be based on the average daily volume weighted average price of GM shares during the term of the ASR agreements less a discount."", 'Given these facts, the banks managing the ASR will continue to be active buyers of GM shares throughout much of 2024 in order to acquire shares they need to deliver under the agreement. In addition to the ASR, GM has a remaining authorization of roughly $1.30 billion based on prior repurchase authorizations, which the company can complete if it chooses to do so based on market conditions.', ""I view the repurchase program as a solid capital allocation decision given the stock's low valuation. Based on a forward price-earnings ratio of 4.50, GM is repurchasing shares at an earnings yield of more than 20%. Given the highly competitive nature of the auto business, I do not believe the company would be able to earn this level of return on capital by reinvesting in the business itself given the historically low ROIC that the company has generated."", ""Currently, Wall Street analysts' consensus for fiscal 2024 call for the company to report adjustd earnings of $7.80 per share. Comparably, during the company's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings release, the company guided for a range of $8.50 to $9.50 for the year. Based on this difference, I believe the company is poised to deliver better than consensus results."", ""Moreover, the company's guidance itself may prove to be conservative. Historically, around 78% of companies in the S&P 500 have beaten their estimates on a quarterly basis. One reason for this is that company executives generally do not want to disappoint investors."", 'In early 2023, GM guided for 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $6 to $7 and ultimately delivered adjusted earings of $7.68. The beat came despite the fact the company faced a crippling UAW strike, which had a negative impact on the company.', 'If the company is able to deliver a similar beat on a percentage basis, as was the case in 2023, versus initial guidance midpoint, the adjusted earnings per share for 2024 would be approximately $10.60 per share.', ""GM currently trades at roughly 5 times consensus 2024 earnings per shares. This compares to the broader market, which trades at approximately 22 times consensus 2024 earnings. Surely GM should trade at a multiple which is well below the broader market given the highly cyclical nature of its business and historically low return on invested capital. However, I think the current discount is too extreme. Over the past three years, the stock has traded at an average earnings multiple of 6.80 times. Additionally, GM's closest peer, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F), trades at roughly 6.60 times consensus 2024 earnings."", 'The stock currently has a GF Value of roughly $53 per share, which would imply a forward price-earnings ratio of roughly 6.80 times the current consensus and 5.90 times its 2024 guidance. In this case, I agree with the GF Value and believe the stock can trade in the $50 range.', 'GM Data by GuruFocus', 'The most significant risk the GM bulls face is a significant economic slowdown. The auto business is highly cyclical and thus GM would experience a hit to financial performance in the event of an economic slowdown. However, it should be noted the company currently has a very strong balance sheet with just over $36 billion in automotive liquidity. This liquidity buffer should allow the company to ride out an economic storm and make it through the cycle, but the stock price may suffer during the interim.', ""Another risk GM faces is potential market share losses to competitors as the automobile business is highly competitive and currently experiencing a secular shift toward electric vehicles. For 2023, GM reported total U.S. market share of 16.20%, which represents a roughly 0.30% increase from market share the previous year. The company's share of the EV market as of the fourth quarter of 2023 is estimated at 6.9% and thus, a rapid shift toward EVs has the potential to result in decreased market share for GM."", 'GM shares have rallied sharply over the past three months due to a number of positive developments, but the bullish move may not be done.', ""The company's massive ASR program will continue to serve as an upside catalyst in 2024 as banks work to complete the necessary purchases. Additionally, consensus estimates for 2024 adjusted earnings per share remain well below company guidance, which is likely conservative. Thus, I believe the company is poised to deliver better-than-expected earnings results. Finally, GM's valuation remains fairly cheap despite the massive move higher over the past few months."", 'For these reasons, I believe the recent rally can continue.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

The article cites a report by Cox Automotive, which states that the sales in 2023 were reported to be nearly 2 times more compared to 2022. Electric vehicles accounted for 7.9% of the industry sales in the US in 2023. However, multiple challenges hinder the growth of the EV market including high prices and restricted charging infrastructure.', 'On January 19, Reuters reported that the US Department of Transportation and Energy will be making a $325 million investment across three different programs, aiming to advance EV technologies, repair chargers, and cut battery costs. Moreover, it awarded nearly $150 million for repairing and replacing around 4,500 existing electric vehicle charging ports in 20 states. The new funds for electric vehicle chargers are a part of the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The program is funded by a $1 trillion 2021 infrastructure law, which says that the states must employ federally-funded EV charging ports for a minimum of 5 years operating 97% of the time. These efforts are expected to contribute positively to the US EV market.', 'Some of the major companies in the electric vehicle market include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).', 'On January 31, Reuters reported that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has decided to expand its battery production to Nevada. The company aims to bring cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFP) to the US. This strategic move by Tesla, Inc.

While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 30.6% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 144.2% upside.

So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.', ""Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in GM"", ""There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher.

It was Powell’s first comments about the industry following a new bout of turmoil cascading through the stocks of many regional banks.', '""I don\'t think there\'s much risk of a repeat of 2008,"" Powell said, referring to a financial crisis 16 years ago that took down some of the biggest institutions on Wall Street as well as hundreds of banks across the US.', '""I do think it’s a manageable problem,"" he added.', 'The new concerns about regional banks were triggered by $116 billion commercial real estate lender New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), which shocked Wall Street last Wednesday when it slashed its dividend, reported a surprise quarterly loss, and stockpiled millions for future loan losses related to commercial real estate holdings.', 'The stock of the Hicksville, N.Y.-based lender fell 38% on Wednesday and another 11% on Thursday, dragging the rest of the sector down with it. The stocks recovered Friday but dropped once again on Monday as New York Community Bancorp fell more than 10%.', 'Powell acknowledged in his ""60 Minutes"" interview that some smaller banks will ""have to be closed"" or merged ""out of existence"" due to losses tied to the falling values of properties across the US that are suddenly worth much less due to the Fed’s elevated interest rates and the effect of a pandemic that emptied out many city-center buildings.', 'But ""we looked at the larger banks\' balance sheets, and it appears to be a manageable problem,"" Powell said.', '""There\'s some smaller and regional banks that have concentrated exposures in these areas that are challenged.

Not all segments of commercial real estate are expected to face the same problems.', 'Demand for commercial real estate loans from US banks, meanwhile, weakened in the fourth quarter of 2023 as bank officers tightened their standards, according to a new Fed report released Monday.

Those buildings account for 22% of its loans.', 'Chiaverini said the bank should have set aside more in reserves last year while booking a gain from its purchase of assets from the failed Signature Bank.', '""The severity of the issue is, I would say, mostly idiosyncratic to New York Community Bank because they were so under-reserved relative to the risk in their portfolio,"" he added.', 'The ""perfect storm"" that could create problems for the rest of the industry, according to Chiaverini, is if inflation goes back up, forcing the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, and the US economy enters a recession. Borrowers would then have problems keeping up with their loans.', 'If those things don’t happen, the commercial real estate pain should be ""manageable"" for the banks, he added.', 'The Fed chair repeated that same word three times in his ""60 Minutes"" interview.', '""It should be manageable,"" Powell said.', 'David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.', 'Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.', 'Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance']"

While there are countless strategies investors can employ to grow their nest egg in the stock market, buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks tends to be among the smartest ways to make money.', ""Last year, the Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, released a report that examined the power of dividend stocks over time. In particular, researchers examined the annualized performance of dividend stocks to nonpayers over the previous half-century (1973-2022). Whereas publicly traded companies that don't offer a payout delivered a modest annualized return of 3.95%, the dividend payers more than doubled up the nonpayers with a 9.18% annualized return."", ""Hartford Funds' findings on dividend stocks aren't a surprise. Companies that can generate a recurring profit, consistently share a percentage of that profit with their shareholders, and offer transparent long-term growth guidance, should be expected to rise in value over time."", ""The challenge for income seekers is maximizing the yield they receive while avoiding danger. Since risk and yield do tend to correlate, high-yielding stocks can sometimes be more trouble than they're worth. But this isn't always the case."", 'What follows are three magnificent ultra-high-yield dividend stocks -- sporting an average yield of 7.34% -- that are screaming buys in February.', 'The first unrivaled dividend stock that makes for a genius buy in the shortest month of the year is domestic tobacco giant Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Altria has raised its payout 58 times over the past 54 years.', ""There's no question that Altria's growth heyday is in the rearview mirror. Consumers have become increasingly aware of the potential dangers of long-term tobacco use, which has led to a precipitous downturn in adult cigarette smoking rates dating back to the mid-1960s. Whereas roughly 42% of U.S. adults smoked cigarettes in the mid-1960s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds that only 11.5% of adults were smokers as of 2021."", 'Though a shrinking pool of users would normally be the ultimate red flag for investors, Altria Group has two well-defined catalysts working in its favor.', 'As I noted somewhat recently, Altria possesses exceptional pricing power on its tobacco products. Tobacco contains nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. The addictive lure of nicotine makes smokers more willing to absorb price increases that outpace the prevailing rate of inflation. Even though aggregate cigarette shipments have been declining, Altria has the ability to modestly grow its sales by raising its prices.', ""I'll add to the above that it's a lot easier for Altria to raise its prices, compared to other cigarette producers, because of its dominant Marlboro brand. Marlboro closed out 2023 with a 42.1% share of the cigarette category. Smokers are willing to pay up for a premium brand they're familiar with."", ""The second catalyst for Altria is its push into smokeless products. A perfect example is its June 2023 acquisition of electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings. NJOY has received marketing granted orders (MGOs) for a half-dozen of its products from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. MGOs are effectively green lights for NJOY's e-vapor products to stay on retail shelves. The overwhelming majority of vape products in retail stores lack MGOs."", ""Valued at 8 times forward-year earnings and sporting a yield that's approaching 10%, Altria looks like a dividend investors' dream come true."", 'Perhaps no ultra-high-yield dividend stock embodies the idiom ""one man\'s trash is another man\'s treasure"" more so than pharmaceutical stock Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). With shares of the company once again nearing a 10-year low, its yield has ballooned to more than 6.2%.', 'The issue for Pfizer is that its COVID-19 tailwind has come and gone. Pfizer was one of the few companies to successfully develop a COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty), as well as an oral treatment (Paxlovid) to lessen symptoms of the illness. After generating more than $56 billion in combined sales from Comirnaty and Paxlovid in 2022, Pfizer is forecasting only a combined $8 billion from these two blockbusters in the current year.', ""While this might feel like letting air out of the tire on a car, let me be perfectly clear that none of Pfizer's proverbial tires are flat."", ""On an apples-to-apples basis, which excludes the company's COVID-19 treatments, Pfizer's remaining portfolio of dozens of approved therapies grew by 7% in 2023, with double-digit growth from its Specialty Care segment. Pfizer's portfolio, sans COVID-19 treatments, is expected to grow by another 3% to 5% in 2024."", ""Furthermore, Pfizer's share price was punished after its admission in December that its acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen would result in a one-time hit of $0.40 per share for its 2024 earnings. Looking more than 12 months out, Pfizer anticipates cost synergies from this deal, as well as a considerably more robust portfolio of high-margin cancer therapies."", ""Investors would also be wise to note that the healthcare sector is highly defensive. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy performs, people still need prescription medicines and healthcare services. In short, Pfizer's operating cash flow tends to be predictable in any economic climate."", 'Lastly, the valuation makes a lot of sense. Investors can scoop up shares of Pfizer right now for less than 10x forward-year earnings and a mere 2.5x estimated sales in the current year.', ""The third magnificent ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's a screaming buy in February is telecom company Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ)."", 'Legacy telecom providers have been hit with a bit of a double whammy over the past two years. The fastest rate-hiking cycle by the Federal Reserve in four decades could make future debt-financed deals and refinancing costlier.', 'The other issue for Verizon is the July report from The Wall Street Journal that alleges lead-sheathed cables still in use by legacy telecom companies could lead to environmental and health liabilities, as well as lofty replacement costs.', ""However, Verizon responded to the WSJ report by noting only a small percentage of its network utilizes lead-clad cables. It also noted that testing of its lead-sheathed cables is underway. The key point being that any potential liability for telecom companies would be determined by the U.S. court system. This is typically a multiyear process and doesn't pose any threat to telecom companies in the short run."", ""What investors should be focused on is Verizon's modest but steady growth propelled by the 5G revolution. Upgrading its network to handle faster download speeds is encouraging users to consume more data. Data happens to be where Verizon's wireless segment generates its juiciest margins."", ""The other key driver for Verizon is its broadband segment. Being able to offer 5G download speeds to residential customers has helped the company add at least 400,000 net broadband users for five consecutive quarters. Even though broadband isn't the growth driver it was two decades ago, it's good for an uptick in operating cash flow and has been known to encourage high-margin service bundling."", ""Let me also add that wireless service and internet access have become basic necessities. Consumers are highly unlikely to cancel these services, which makes Verizon's cash flow quite predictable year after year."", ""As with Altria and Pfizer, Verizon's valuation is attractive. Shares can be scooped up for less than 9x forward-year earnings, which provides a safe floor and modest upside for patient investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Altria Group wasn’t one of them.

O-RAN offers the promise of a wide range of benefits that should introduce new competition and innovation into the RAN ecosystem with the establishment of open and interoperable interfaces between different hardware and software components. The addition of this new O-RAN capable equipment underscores Verizon’s commitment to driving O-RAN standards and technology in the industry.', 'The transition to Open RAN has the potential to bring many benefits in terms of deployment flexibility, faster innovation in an open environment, and greater service options by increasing the opportunity for new entrants to provide competitive and advanced solutions.

Virtualization and orchestration are key components of this modernization. Along with many vendor partners, Verizon has been leading the charge of the design, development, and deployment of virtualized Radio Access Network technology. This move to a cloud native, container-based, virtualized architecture has led to more flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and significant cost efficiency in the network.', 'Early in 2019 Verizon announced the virtualization of the core network with a cloud-native, containerized architecture. In 2020, it announced that\xa0the achievement of fully virtualized baseband functions – the heaviest portion of computing on the Radio Access Network.

With this virtualized baseband unit, Verizon laid the foundation for deployment flexibility, scaling, and rapid integration of services for existing and new use cases.', 'With the widespread virtualization of network functions across Verizon’s core and RAN, hardware and software functions of the network have been disaggregated and Verizon customers are already enjoying many benefits of that architecture. This creates the foundation for O-RAN.

Can you talk to us about that and sort of where we are and who stands to win? Or is it not zero sum here?"", ""STACY RASGON: Well, so there are export controls. Now that were put on US companies selling AI parts into China. Mostly, they affect Nvidia. They don't really affect others, because most of the others, the revenues were very, very small. Nvidia had a sizable business in China. And under the export controls, as they currently send, Nvidia basically can't sell any of these parts in China at all."", 'They are working on new parts that will be legal to sell. However, given the performance thresholds that are around these sanctions, they have to drop the performance very considerably. And in fact, there are local Chinese alternatives from companies like Huawei that at least on paper will have better performance than what NVIDIA is allowed to sell into China.', ""What Nvidia will have is software compatibility. And like a lot of the existing AI infrastructure and models that have been built in China were already built on Nvidia hardware, and so they're leveraging Nvidia-- the Nvidia software ecosystem. And so the Nvidia parts will allow seamless integration with that. And so they're probably more suitable I would think for more of the tier two developers. The larger ones in China may go with other alternatives if they've got the resources available to port everything over."", ""I would say long term, though, I kind of view this-- my view is once they put sanctions on a year ago, I think long term, the China TAM for the US guys is going to be impaired because they've lowered these thresholds. But even if they never did, they were never going to be raised. And so the gap between what is legal for US companies to sell into China in terms of performance and the rest of the world is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger over time anyways. And so I think you do need to think about that TAM ideally as potentially as impaired."", ""Now I think the overall TAM long term is enormous. I think it's big with or without China. So I think it's manageable. But you need to do that. I will put aside, by the way the whole question of, was this whole thing the right thing to do? I mean, I can understand the national security implications of wanting to constrain China's ability to build this up. But at the same time-- and it's not just AI, it's AI and it's equipment and all kinds of other things-- we are forcing China to become creative, right, in all senses of that word."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, that's what I was going to ask you, Stacy. I mean, how far are Chinese chip developers from matching Nvidia? You said the Huawei chips allegedly can do what the lower-- you know, the ones-- the lower performance ones can do. But I mean, you know, it's still seems like there's still a pretty big gap between homegrown chips and what Nvidia is producing elsewhere."", ""STACY RASGON: It is. And so what does that mean? That means that you'll have to shovel a lot more chips at the problem. So for example, the Huawei ascend supposedly is roughly equivalent to an Nvidia A100, that part for Nvidia is two or three years old. On a performance basis, it's roughly equivalent. Again, it doesn't have the software ecosystem and everything. But if you just want to take that, I mean, fine."", ""So if they want to get the same amount of performance that Nvidia's or others are delivering with their core parts, they'll have to put a lot more silicon in place in order to do that. So that cost money in terms of chip cost. It costs a lot of money in terms of power and infrastructure and everything else. And so is it going to be cost competitive like if they had to sell that stuff elsewhere in the world? Absolutely not. It's not competitive."", ""But they have no choice. So they'll do it. We saw the same thing like on smartphones. Huawei is making smartphone chips again using supposedly SMIC 7 nanometer processes, which are not going to be competitive with what say Qualcomm or other main suppliers can provide. And they're going to burn more power. They're going to cost a lot more. But again, but if you have no choice, you will do it. And then over time, you will try to figure out ways to optimize within the constraints that you have. Again, they are going to have to be creative."", ""I don't know what this means 10 years from now, 15 years from now. But it will be more challenging. And China in general is a big market for US and other suppliers. It's going to be tougher. It's going to be tougher. I don't know what it looks like though as we kind of roll this out."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. We'll keep watching. Dr. Stacy Rasgon, Thanks for joining the show, my friend.

At the moment, no trend is garnering more hoopla than artificial intelligence (AI)."", 'When I say ""artificial intelligence,"" I\'m talking about the use of software and systems to handle tasks typically overseen by humans. The not-so-secret sauce to AI is the incorporation of machine learning, which allows software and systems to learn/evolve and become more efficient at their tasks over time.', ""According to researchers at PwC, AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- and there's no way investors are going to overlook figures this large."", ""While there are dozens of technology-driven companies that have embraced AI with open arms, the poster child of the AI revolution is semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the infrastructure backbone of high-compute data centers. In other words, they're the brains that allow for the split-second decision-making required of AI-driven systems."", ""Although Nvidia is expected to have more than doubled its sales in fiscal 2024 (the company's fiscal year ended in late January) on the heels of exceptionally strong data-center revenue, it's also a company that's seemingly priced for perfection in an imperfect industry with numerous unknowns."", ""As I've previously pointed out, Nvidia's biggest enemy looks to be itself in calendar year 2024. Whereas A100 and H100 GPU scarcity led to phenomenal pricing power that fueled almost the entirety of its data-center revenue growth through the first nine months of fiscal 2024, an increase in the company's GPU production in the current fiscal year could sap its pricing power and hamper its gross margin."", ""Something else to consider is that Nvidia isn't going to be the only GPU player in AI-accelerated data centers. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and intends to ramp up production in 2024. Likewise, Intel unveiled its generative AI Gaudi3 chip as a direct competitor to the H100 in December, with plans to launch sometime this year. Nvidia's monopoly like market share in high-compute data centers is liable to fall."", ""To make matters worse, U.S. regulators have, on two separate occasions, restricted exports of Nvidia's high-powered AI chips to China. Not being able to export AI-focused chips to the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product could cost Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter."", 'With Nvidia set to face a number of challenges, its estimated price-to-cash-flow ratio of 61 in fiscal 2024 is exceptionally pricey. The good news is there are two other AI stocks that are still historically cheap.', ""The first historically inexpensive artificial intelligence stock that's a considerably better value than Nvidia is social media company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Even after gaining more in market cap in a single day ($197 billion) than any other stock in history -- a feat accomplished on Feb. 2, 2024 -- Meta is still exceptionally cheap."", 'The company behind the top social media ""real estate"" on the planet is utilizing AI in a variety of ways. Meta AI offers a virtual chatbot that can entertain and educate people, while more than a dozen generative AI solutions are being tested to tailor advertisements and improve search functions, among other tasks.', 'Meta also has its augmented and virtual reality segment known as Reality Labs. Even though Reality Labs is losing copious amounts of money at the moment, it could evolve into a key on-ramp to the metaverse in the latter-half of the decade.', 'For now, Meta\'s social media sites are its bread and butter. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are consistently among the most-downloaded apps globally, and they were collectively responsible (as part of Meta\'s ""family of Apps"") for attracting nearly 4 billion monthly active users during the fourth quarter. Businesses are well aware that their best chance to target broad audiences online is through advertisements with Meta. This is where generative AI could be especially useful.', 'Meta also closed out 2023 with $47 billion in net cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated almost $46.8 billion in income from operations (even with Reality Labs weighing on its operations) for the year. With a clearly dominant foundational segment (social media), Meta has demonstrated that it can afford to take risks.', ""Despite catapulting to an all-time closing high on Feb. 2, shares of Meta can be scooped up for 13 times forward-year cash flow. That's 17% below Meta's average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the previous five years."", ""Furthermore, Meta shares are valued at 21 times forward-year earnings, which is more or less in-line with the benchmark S&P 500. But when factoring in Wall Street's expected annualized earnings growth of 32% for Meta over the next five years, we're left with a minuscule price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 0.7."", ""The other unbelievably cheap AI stock that'll have you completely forgetting about Nvidia is China's leading e-commerce company, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA)."", ""Though Alibaba's e-commerce segment has long been its foundation: Taobao and Tmall account for almost 51% of China's online retail sales, according to the International Trade Administration. The company's future could rest on considerably higher-margin cloud services. As of March 31, 2023, Alibaba Cloud had gobbled up 34% of cloud-infrastructure service share in mainland China."", ""The most exciting application of AI for Alibaba is its large language model (LLM) known as Tongyi Qianwen. It's effectively Alibaba's own version of ChatGPT, the AI chatbot that ignited the AI craze a little more than a year ago."", ""In addition to traditional question-and-answer functionality like ChatGPT, Tongyi Qianwen's most important task might just be generative AI solutions within Alibaba's market-leading cloud. Generative AI could be tasked with improving search quality and comparisons, as well as tailoring marketing to individual consumer needs."", ""Alibaba should also benefit in the years to come from a rebounding Chinese economy whose supply chains were crippled by lockdowns for multiple years during the COVID-19 pandemic. A steady rebound in consumer- and enterprise-purchasing activity, coupled with China's expanding middle class, increases the likelihood of sustained growth for Alibaba's leading e-commerce marketplace and cloud-service platform."", ""Alibaba closed out September with north of $85 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash, and equity securities. If its net cash is backed out of the equation, shares of the company are valued at just 5 times forward-year earnings.

For McKesson, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today."", 'According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in February 2014 would be worth $2,892.32, or a gain of 189.23%, as of February 5, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.', ""Compare this to the S&P 500's rally of 178.17% and gold's return of 55.50% over the same time frame."", 'Analysts are forecasting more upside for MCK too.', 'In the past year, McKesson has outperformed its industry. McKesson exited the fiscal first quarter on a strong note, beating estimates on both counts. Strong fiscal second-quarter show by the pharmaceutical segment is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2024 instills optimism. Strong adjusted operating profit growth across key segments is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. Declining demand for COVID-19-related products and loss of sales due to divesture of European businesses continue to hurt Medical-Surgical Solutions and International segments. Yet, both gross and operating margin contractions are woes.

Plus, as you select the coverage options you desire, these tools ensure you’re comparing quotes for similar policies.', 'Searching for car insurance discounts that different providers offer can be another great way to save on your premiums. There are many different discount options and incentives available. Below are some of the most common.', 'Bundling discounts, also known as multi-policy discounts.

Here’s what those terms mean:', 'Direct insurers: With direct insurers, you typically buy your insurance straight from the company’s website or app. There’s no intermediary between you and the insurance provider (and no separate agent to offer you personalized advice or answers either). Examples include Geico, Esurance and Progressive.', 'Captive agents: Captive insurance agents only sell the products their company offers and cannot provide you with quotes from competitors. Examples in the auto insurance space include Farmers, Nationwide, State Farm, and Farm Bureau.', 'Independent agents: Independent insurance agents work with numerous providers. As a result, they can sell products from multiple insurance companies and help you shop around for the cheapest rates and hidden discounts.

Call your insurance agent or insurance company and ask if you’re eligible for any of those discounts listed above. If you’re considering changing insurers or you’ve found a lower rate with a competitor, mention that.', 'Increase your deductibles: If you have a solid emergency fund, setting a higher deductible could lower your car insurance premiums. In return, however, you’d have to pay more out of pocket for accident repairs before your coverage kicks in.', ""Adjust coverage amounts: It's a good idea to take a look once a year or so at how much car insurance you need. If you have an older vehicle that’s paid in full, you might consider reducing your coverage or even switching to liability only. But you should go this route only if you’re financially able to fix your own vehicle in an accident."", 'While premiums vary among insurers, there are some common factors that affect the car insurance quotes you receive from different providers, including the following.', 'Vehicle make and model: Certain types of cars cost more money than others to insure. As a rule, new cars and more expensive cars have higher repair costs, which will lead to higher insurance rates. If you’re considering buying a new or used vehicle, it’s wise to research the cost of insurance before you make your purchase. If you drive an electric vehicle, that can affect your rates, and classic cars require their own kind of insurance.', ""Age, gender, and marital status: Younger drivers typically pay more for auto insurance due to a lack of experience behind the wheel. Historically, men have paid more for car insurance than women because insurance companies view them as a higher risk to cover. What's more, married car insurance policyholders tend to have lower insurance premiums than their single counterparts."", 'Coverage selections and limits: The types of insurance you choose and your coverage limits have a significant impact on your car insurance rates.', 'Credit score: Your credit-based insurance score helps predict how likely you are to file an insurance claim. Good credit has the potential to save you money on your premiums, although some states limit or don’t allow insurance providers to use credit when pricing auto insurance policies.', 'Where you live: Insurers also use your ZIP code when issuing car insurance policies because where you live is associated with a particular level of risk. Areas with heavy congestion or bad road conditions can lead to increased car accidents.', 'Driving record: A clean driving record should save you money on your car insurance. On the other hand, if you have a history of speeding tickets, DUIs, at-fault accidents or other black marks, you should expect to pay higher premiums.', 'According to J.D.

Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities.

Reconciliation of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.Now with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Thank you, Sid, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today.As always, I would like to begin with Slide #3, our safety performance, which is our #1 priority at Air Products. I'm very pleased to share that our employee recorded injury rate in first quarter was 78% than in 2014. And our employee lost time injury rate was at a record roll the best in the industry. Our ultimate goal will always be zero accidents and zero incidents.Now please turn to Slide #4, which summarizes our management philosophy. These principles remain fundamental to how we manage and grow our company.Now please turn to Slide #5. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the results for this quarter. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.82 was 7% higher than last year. Our business performed well and we are moving forward. There were several positive contributions to this result that included: strong conversion margins, robust on-site activities in Americas and Europe and higher quality affiliate income globally.Despite the year-to-year improvement that I just mentioned, our results diverged from the guidance we have given you due to several items that were not factored in our first quarter 2024 outlook. We have given you a forecast and we are delivering less than the forecast. But again, I'd like to stress that we are 7% higher than last year.These factors that affected our guidance are, number 1, larger-than-anticipated volume headwinds from weak economic growth in China. We were too optimistic about the performance in China. Second one is lower helium demand in electronics, especially across the world. But I would like to mention that our pricing in helium stays very stable and very robust. But we have -- the volume was lower than we expected. There is a high -- we had experienced higher costs for a sale of equipment project and the impact of Argentine's currency devaluation.With this, let me talk about our revised full year guidance range. Please turn to Slide #6. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $12.20 to $12.50, which reflects the first quarter events I just discussed. It also reflects evolving geopolitical developments and uncertainties and continued weakness in Asia and helium volumes.This new range is supported by expected positive volume contributions from several new on-site plants and improvement in our LNG sale of equipment business as well as continuing cost productivity that we always pursue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.60 to $2.75. We continue to expect our CapEx to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2024.Now please turn to Slide #7. We are proud of our adjusted earnings per share improvement since 2014, and we have delivered on a consecutive basis for the last 10 years more than 10% annual growth in our earnings. I would like to take the time to thank each and every one of our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication and commitment, which has made it possible for us to deliver these excellent results.Now please turn to Slide #8. In addition to investing in high-return projects, we believe creating shareholder value includes returning cash to our investors by paying a healthy dividend directly to them. In January, we again raised our quarterly dividend to $1.77 per share per quarter, extending our record of 42 consecutive years of dividend increase.We expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to our shareholders in 2024 while continuing to execute hard return industrial gas and clean hydrogen projects that support our customers in their sustainability journey and drive the energy transition. This balanced approach to capital allocation will allow us to meet our capital needs while maintaining our A/A2 credit rating.Now please turn to Slide #9, which shows our EBITDA margin trend since 2014. Our margins have returned to roughly 40% since the second half of fiscal year 2023, going a 1,500 basis point improvement versus 2014. And our margins are leading industry margins and they reflect the continued strength of our business model.Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer, to give you a summary of our first quarter 2024 results. Melissa?"", 'Melissa N. Schaeffer', ""Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our first quarter results. As Seifi stated, our business fundamentals are strong. In comparison to last year, we continue to show underlying sales growth with both positive volume and price. Overall, price for the quarter was up despite lower energy costs across most regions. Volume improved 3% driven by strong on-site volume, including higher demand for hydrogen and contributions from new assets, but partially offset by weaker demand for helium, particularly in Asia.Declining natural gas prices in Europe and North America resulted in 11% lower energy cost pass-through for the company overall. This had no impact on profit but contributed to higher margins. EBITDA improved 8% as favorable volume price net of power costs and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs driven by higher planned maintenance activities and inflation.EBITDA margin of 39.2% jumped more than 500 basis points with lower energy cost pass-through contributing to about 3/4 of this improvement. ROCE remained steady at about 12%. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been about 13%. Sequentially, results were unfavorable primarily due to seasonality in the Americas and sale of equipment headwinds in our corporate segment.Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our first quarter adjusted earnings was $2.82 per share, up $0.18 or 7% compared to last year due to favorable volume, pricing and higher equity affiliate income, partially offset by unfavorable costs.Volume was $0.11 due to improvements in Americas and Europe, which more than offset shortfalls in Asia and the corporate segment. Price, net of variable costs contributed $0.15 this quarter driven by both pricing actions and lower power costs. Costs at an unfavorable impact of $0.21, driven by higher planned maintenance costs, inflation and our efforts support our growth strategy.Equity affiliate income was $0.18 higher due to the contribution of the second phase of Jazan project and positive results from our unconsolidated joint ventures across most regions. The remaining items, including lower tax rate, higher interest expense and other nonoperating expense together had a modest negative 5% impact.Before I turn the call to Dr. Serhan, I would also like to thank the people of Air Products for their commitment to the company. I am proud to be working alongside them as we continue to execute our strategy. Now to begin to review our business segment results, I'll turn the call to Dr. Serhan."", 'Samir Jawdat Serhan', 'Thank you, Melissa. Please turn to Slide 12 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, price and volume together were up 5%. Adverse merchant price increase of 6%, this represents a 2% price improvement for the region overall. This drove contribution margin improvement. Volume grew 3% due to strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA was up 9%, driven by strong price as well as favorable volume and equity affiliates income, while partially offset by higher planned maintenance costs.EBITDA margin was up by almost 800 basis points, driven mostly by lower energy cost cash flow. Sequentially, EBITDA decreased 7% mainly due to seasonality as demand moderated and maintenance activities picked up during the winter.Now please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Asia segment results. The challenging economic conditions in China and the weak electronics market continued to put pressure on the region. Third to last year, our volumes were flat for the region as higher on-site activity offset lower helium demand. Price did jump 1% as we continued to focus on price over volume.EBITDA and EBITDA margin were down primarily due to the unfavorable helium volumes and higher costs. Sequentially, results improved relative to the unfavorable business mix in the previous quarter.Please turn to Slide 14 for a review of our Europe segment results. Volumes were up 9%, benefiting from better on-site activities, including the new project in Uzbekistan. Compared to last year, merchant pricing remained stable relative to the decline in energy costs, contributing to margin improvement.EBITDA was up 28% driven by favorable volume, lower power costs and stronger currencies against the U.S. dollar, which more than compensated for increased costs due to inflation and planned maintenance activities. EBITDA margin was over 1,000 basis points higher, about half of which was due to the impact of lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, results improved driven by favorable price, volume and cost.Now please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. Compared to last year, sales decreased due to lower volume, EBITDA improved due to the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project in mid-January of last year.Please now turn to Slide 16 for our corporate and other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Despite higher sales from LNG activity, EBITDA declined due to higher costs in our non-LNG sale of equipment business, as Seifi mentioned before.Our activities related to the LNG equipment and technology business are robust. We continue to have constructive conversations with customers who are interested in our offerings, and we expect our LNG-related projects to improve the corporate segment moving forward.At this moment, I also would like to thank our teams around the world for their effort and demonstrating their determination to overcome the challenges we are facing. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks. Seifi?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #17. As I always say, our real competitive advantage is the commitment, dedication and motivation of our people. I am proud to see that commitment and motivation in action every day in our company, and I'm very proud of our people. The fundamentals of our existing business are strong and we are moving forward. The short-term issues we have discussed do not change the compelling long-term prospects of Air Products.Air Products is pursuing a first-mover growth strategy with our core industrial gases business as the first pillar and our blue and green hydrogen projects as the second pillar. Executing our strategy in these 2 pillars with sustainability underpinning both of them enables us to fulfill our higher purpose as a company, which is to help solve significant energy and environmental challenges in our world. That is our highest purpose.First, our industrial gases business and technology solutions help customers across dozens of industries improve yield, increase production, reduce energy consumption and lower emissions, in other words, to make more with less, while reducing the impact on the environment.Second, the world needs more energy and wants that energy delivered with a lower carbon footprint. At Air Products, we are demonstrating our leadership position, leveraging our decade-long experience, core competencies, core technologies and our ability to execute world-scale hydrogen projects.By producing and delivering low and zero carbon hydrogen at the scale for heavy UG transportation and industry, we can meaningfully contribute to the goal of decarbonizing the world. We believe that the first mover advantage will be substantial and deliver enduring long-term shareholder value, both in terms of return to Air Products and in generating a cleaner future for everybody.With that, we are now more than happy to take your questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan."", 'Jeffrey John Zekauskas', 'When did the Gulf Coast ammonia projects come on? And is that a meaningful income stream for you?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Gulf Coast ammonia consists of 2 different parts, one is the hydrogen plant and the other one is the actual ammonia plant. I can comment on the hydrogen plant because we own that and that is sale of gas that is on stream and it's producing revenue. And on the other part, I don't want to comment because we don't own that facility and allow the owners to make a statement on that, if it's necessary."", 'Jeffrey John Zekauskas', 'In the quarter, there was -- yes, thank you for that. In the quarter, the expense is materially higher year-over-year that your expectations for 2024, you have a large cost-cutting program, maybe losses on sale of equipment would be smaller, there was significant room for improvement, particular line. Is that the case or have things changed?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Jeff, you are absolutely right. That is the case. In the first quarter, our costs were higher because of the sale of equipment issue that you mentioned. And we expect that in the -- as we go forward, that would not be repeated, and therefore, our year-to-year cost will be lower, as I had mentioned to you before.', 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners."", 'Michael Joseph Harrison', ""I was hoping that you could give a little bit more detail on what's going on within the helium business. Is that a situation where demand is lower or a situation where you guys are struggling to get the volumes of helium that you need? And also which regions have the biggest exposure to helium? It seems like this is mostly an Asia issue, at least in the first quarter."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Thank you for the question and that's an excellent question. Number 1, we do not have any issues with having helium molecules for sale. We are actually the best -- we have always been the supplier that has delivered helium to people when they need it. We have a tavern, we have significant production facilities around the world. So we are a very reliable supplier and we have always been.The issue with helium is that, number 1, demand is lower especially in electronics across the board and particularly in China and in Asia. And the other thing is that, as I said, we operate on the basis that we want value for the product that we are selling. So we have held on the pricing and whether we might have lost some market share, that is possible.But we have no issues delivering the product but we definitely see, as I said, a weakness in demand across the world. And in terms of Air Products, in terms of helium volumes, obviously, Asia is a significant part of that. It's not -- the other regions use a lot of helium, too, but Asia is the biggest one."", 'Michael Joseph Harrison', ""All right. That's very helpful. And then my second question is related to your guidance. It looks like the implied guidance for the first half of the year is around $5.50 in EPS and you're expecting maybe something closer to $7 in the second half. Can you talk about the visibility that you have that gives you confidence on a much better second half? And maybe help us bridge the improvement that you're expecting in the second half versus the first half, that $1.50 or so."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, that's an excellent question. Obviously, the guidance is what is our best estimate at this point, right? We can't foresee the world events. But fundamentally, when you look at Air Products, during the years we consistently delivered about 46%, 47% of the year results in the first half and we delivered around 53%, 54% in the second half. So the second half is usually our strongest quarter because of seasonality. So you should take that into account.And then the other thing that we are right now, by giving you the guidance, is that we are expecting that in the second half of the year, some of the on-site projects that we have will be running very strongly, and therefore, we will have a higher income from those. That is our estimate as of today. But how the world will turn, we'll see. But that is how we bridge the gap of why we will be able to deliver the $7 versus the $5.50 in the first half."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to John Roberts from Mizuho."", 'John Roberts', 'Seifi, is the weakness in China also related to on-site operations? And maybe you could separate the gasifier business from other on-site.', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""John, first of all, thank you for your question, and I hope all is well with you. There is no weakness in on-site in China. Our on-site business is take or pay across the world, therefore we don't see any issues there. The fundamental issue is on the merchant side and helium and that is related to the economic activity.I'd just like to caution everybody on the call that the economic situation in China is not as robust as people might think. As you know, we make products that are used instantaneously. We are a great leading indicator. And things are not really that exciting in that part of the world."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Steve Byrne from Bank of America."", 'Stephen V. Byrne', 'I was just looking at the location of Jazan, and it seems to be within 100 miles of quite a few of these recent strikes in Yemen. And I just wanted to ask, is everything there okay at the plant? Or do you see any access to labor or risks of this issue going on right now?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, first of all, up to now, we have not seen any incidents. None of these missiles and so on have been directed at the facility. So I mean, I can't predict the future. But up to now, there has not been any issues. The refinery is running fully. Our investment -- I mean, our performance there is great. I'm very proud of our people.We are operating 16 gasifiers, which are the largest in the world for gasifying the bottom of the refinery. And despite predictions for the worse, those things are actually working and we are producing syngas, we are supplying hydrogen to the refinery and we are making close to 4,000 megawatts of power that is delivered to the Saudi grid. So up to now, everything is fine."", 'Stephen V. Byrne', ""Very good. And can you provide any more detail on the CapEx target for the year, the $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Can you just highlight what are the largest projects within that list? I was just curious whether you're moving forward with the project in North Texas this year."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Right now, in that $5 billion and $5.5 billion, there is not a significant amount of money for the project in Texas because we are in the process of getting the permit and doing the preliminary engineering. But we did spend a few hundred million, but it is not a significant part of the $5.5 billion.The $5 billion to $5.5 billion is mainly going to be spent on our continuing operations in NEOM in Saudi Arabia for our green hydrogen facility, a substantial amount of it will go to our blue hydrogen facility and other substantial amount will be our blue hydrogen facility in Canada and then obviously, our expenditure on the sustainable airline fuel facility in Los Angeles.And then obviously, we have our maintenance CapEx and about $1 billion a year that we spend on our day-to-day investments, like any other industrial gas business that they don't usually talk about it and we don't put out press releases about how many small projects won because we do win small projects like everybody else. But that is about $1 billion, too. And our maintenance CapEx is around $500 million, $600 million. So $1.5 billion is those and then the rest of it is for the big projects."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets."", 'John Patrick McNulty', ""So we had a question on the dividend hike that you guys announced earlier. It strikes us as kind of smaller than, I guess, what we've seen in the past from Air Products. And I guess the question is, why is that? And is it -- is there any concern from, say, the rating agencies around the comfort with your capital spending? Or is there some change why that hike would be as kind of modest as it's been? I guess how should we think about that?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, for the past 6 or 7 years, I have always been telling people that I personally believe that dividend should be a percentage of the stock price. And we had given people a guidance that we target, that we pay about 2.5% of our stock price as dividend and we were doing that. But now with the stock price, where it is, and you are talking about now more than $7, it's significantly higher than that. So I don't see why we should significantly increase the dividend when the stock price is where it is.Because the shareholders are getting more than 2.5% from the stock and then 10% growth, then it becomes at least almost a guaranteed 12.5% return if they buy the stock. There is no issue with respect to our cash or cash flow and so on, but -- we also have investors who believe we shouldn't pay any dividend but obviously, that will never happen and we are never going to reduce the dividend. But the rate of increase is very directly related to the stock price, my friend."", 'John Patrick McNulty', ""Got it. Okay. So it's more about the yield, not necessarily the earnings growth or anything like that."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Exactly.', 'John Patrick McNulty', ""Okay. And then just as a follow-up question, it would just be on -- I know you mentioned earlier in kind of first half versus second half, there's a bunch of projects that should be running a little harder, running up more or coming on. I guess, can you remind us what projects aren't necessarily fully running in your first half of the year but will be in the second half of the year, just so we can kind of model that out or map that out a little bit better?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, that one then I'm going to get into disclosing the operational details of our customers, and I'm not -- I don't have the privilege of doing that because of the confidentiality agreements we have. So if you give me a break, I cannot answer that question in detail. Sorry about that."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley."", 'Vincent Stephen Andrews', ""If I could just ask on the helium, what was sort of the surprise in the quarter on the electronic side of the equation? Like so what's really changing with those customers? Is it something in particular or is it just the economy there is decelerating? And are we at the point with it in the electronics piece that you're comfortable that, that aspect has flattened out at a level that you're comfortable with? Maybe we could start there."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Vincent, thanks for the good question. Usually, what happens with the electronics industry, and you know this better than I do, is that they run very strongly during the third quarter of the calendar year to make all of the chips and so on which are used for all the toys and everything that people are going to buy for Christmas. And then when that period is over, usually the fourth quarter of the year for the chip makers is slower. That is the general thing.And then in addition to that, you do have economic conditions and all of that. I am not an expert in terms of the dynamics of the electronics industry, but I would like to tell you that, that is what we are seeing, that a lot of these people are slowing down. And then the other thing that might be in play is that the helium prices being high, it significantly affects the operational people at the chip manufacturing facilities to try to conserve as much helium as they can or other users. So there might be a little bit of a demand disruption, too.', 'Vincent Stephen Andrews', ""Okay. And then as a follow-up, in the fiscal second quarter we obviously just had another winter storm or winter freeze in the Gulf Coast area. Are you anticipating that you're going to have some downtime associated with that or customers are going to have downtime from some plants being turned off in preparation for that weather event?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""That's a very difficult question to answer, quite honestly. That might be the case, but I don't want to predict that, Vincent. I don't know."", 'Vincent Stephen Andrews', 'Well, I just meant what has already happened, the storm that happened in January. Is that already baked in?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Yes. Dr. Serhan, do you have anything to add to that?', 'Samir Jawdat Serhan', 'Minor issues really that happened. We still see very strong hydrogen demand even during that phase.', 'Operator', ""We'll go next to David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank."", 'David L. Begleiter', 'Just staying on helium, Can you quantify the impact of the year-over-year helium profit decline in Q1 and your expectations for the full year in terms of helium profit decline?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""David, you're asking a question that we have never answered, that is, we have never really disclosed the details of the performance of our helium business for competitive reasons. And I'm sure you understand that. So I do not want to quantify that exactly. But if you look at the -- when you compare to last year, when we compare to last year, we are still ahead. What we are trying to explain is the difference between what we delivered versus guidance versus last year, we are still ahead.But we expected -- we did not expect the weakness in helium the way it has materialized. Would it continue in the second quarter and the third -- I mean, in the second, third and fourth quarter of our fiscal year? Remains to be seen. And that is one of the reasons we lowered our guidance because we are allowing for the fact that it might continue. But we don't know for sure."", 'David L. Begleiter', ""Understood. And just on the Alberta project now that it's within 12 months hopefully of start-up, do you have timing of that project ramping up early next year? And how should we think about the earnings contribution throughout the calendar year '25 for Alberta?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""David, you broke up. I didn't understand which project you were referring to."", 'David L. Begleiter', 'The Alberta project. When will it come on stream? And how should we think about the earnings cadence post the start-up early next year?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Sure. Excellent. I'll have Dr. Serhan answer that. Dr. Serhan?"", 'Samir Jawdat Serhan', ""Thank you for the question. We remain incredibly excited about our first blue net zero hydrogen project that's in the construction phase right now. We look to bring it on stream in fiscal year '25, in line with our customary plans. There are no updates in regard to the deployed capital and also the government incentive, we provided that already. So again, we're really fully committed to this asset and things are going well and we're aligned with our customer, IOL."", 'David L. Begleiter', 'Will it be online for this fiscal year?', 'Samir Jawdat Serhan', ""It's in fiscal year '25, I mean, in the second half. This is really in alignment with the planned renewable refinery."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'So basically, everything is going well for that up to now.', 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Josh Spector from UBS."", 'Joshua David Spector', 'So I wanted to follow up just on the guidance and maybe ask specifically, when you talk about the challenges and uncertainty in China and helium demand, et cetera, I guess, to hit your second half, do markets need to improve? Or are you assuming any improvement there? Or is status quo plus what you see coming online enough to get to what your expectations are today for the second half?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""No, we don't expect any improvement, we expect things to be the way they are. I just hope that things don't get worse because of the geopolitical developments. But we are not factoring any significant improvement in world economy. No, that's correct."", 'Joshua David Spector', ""Okay. That's helpful. And just on the sale of equipment. So when you talk about the increase in cost there, is that cost to execute, is that a material issue, a specific contract? Just thinking about how unique or one-off that is. And when you talk about your LNG wins and you've been talking about more projects coming online or sales in the next couple of years, is that a risk we need to think about with some of those contracts underwater or some other cost issue?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""If I may answer the second part, the LNG thing, we expect -- the projects that you're talking about are the projects which are already under execution and we have won. So the risk on that is low. With respect to the sale of equipment thing, what we are talking about is inflation and delays in execution and all of that, that is costing us money. Okay?"", 'Operator', ""We'll go over to Marc Bianchi from TD Cowen."", 'Marc Gregory Bianchi', ""The question was asked earlier about the large components of CapEx, and you had mentioned NEOM, the 2 blue hydrogen projects and SAF. You provided an update on Alberta just now. I'm curious if you could update us on the status of the other 3."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, on the other 3 we don't have anything substantial to report other than what we have told you before. So things are going okay with them as of right now. So we do not have anything material that has happened to report to you yet."", 'Marc Gregory Bianchi', 'Okay. Could you just remind us the start-up expectation for NEOM, Louisiana and SAF?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""NEOM, we are expecting -- I mean, December 31, 2026. With Louisiana, what we have said up to now has been fiscal year 2028. And with SAF, it is somewhere around fiscal year 2027, depending on us getting all of the permits that we need. So -- I'm sorry, with date, I'd like to correct that to 2027. I said -- I think I said '28 but it's '27. That's approximately the time line for those projects."", 'Marc Gregory Bianchi', ""Okay. The other question I had was there have been some reports and news stories lately about natural hydrogen, so naturally occurring hydrogen deposits that could be quite meaningful. I'm curious what your view of that is and if you have any involvement."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""We do not have any involvement in that. And I don't want to give you a scientific answer, but that's a little bit of a pie in the sky that there's hydrogen sitting there that you need to (inaudible) and it will come out at zero cost. But we are not involved in any projects like that and we are not going to get involved in that because we just do not think that, that is a reality."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Mike Leithead from Barclays."", 'Michael James Leithead', ""Seifi, could you maybe update us on the state of your ongoing discussions for green and blue ammonia potential offtake? Should we expect some offtake announcements later this year? Or do you still believe it's better to wait until closer to project startup to formalize some of those?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, on that, you're rising an excellent point. We have basically told people that do not expect any announcement about any offtake until about a year or 1.5 years before the plants come onstream. And the main reason for that is that we believe that as we get closer to the deadlines, that companies have to comply with the new environmental rules, they would certainly realize that there are not that many rear commercial facilities coming onstream that has the product, therefore, the value of our product will be higher than what people think it is today.So we are not in a hurry to sign any agreements. We think the demand is there so we are going to take our time. But in the meantime, if somebody wants to act sooner and gives us a contract -- a long-term contract at the prices that we expect, we might announce that sooner. But I wouldn't want the investors to expect any announcements soon, okay?"", 'Michael James Leithead', ""That makes sense. That's great. That makes sense. And then maybe on a similar note, I believe that the Treasury Department recently came out with guidance around the green hydrogen tax credit. I think most people viewed it as fairly strict, although I also believe Air Products' plans are pretty well aligned with this guidance. Bigger picture, do you have any concerns about the strict interpretation limiting the U.S. industry's ability to take off? Or do you actually see it as advantageous for Air Products?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""No, we absolutely disagree with that point of view that this is limiting. I mean, how is it limiting? We are complying with every single part of what the Treasury Department has put out the 3 pillars and we are committing billions of dollars to build these facilities. Other people can do the same thing. Some people are trying to get money from the government by continuing to pollute the atmosphere and we don't believe that. We believe very strongly in the 3 pillars. That means that any electricity use for production of green hydrogen needs to be additional. Otherwise, you're just going to use coal to replace that power that you use. So it has to be additional.The second thing, it has to be hourly. Because otherwise in the middle of the night when there is no sun, if somebody makes green hydrogen, then you're drawing power from the grid and that has to be replaced again from coal-fired plants and all of that. And so additionality, hourly and then the other thing is that it has to be on the same network.We are fully supportive of what the Treasury Department has put out, I'd like to applaud them for sticking to their principles that the IRA was designed not to make companies rich, but IRA was designed to save the environment. And this should not allow people to get some subsidies if they are not doing something to reduce their pollution into the atmosphere.The IRA is not a handout. The IRA is designed, that is why Congress approved it, to improve the environment, And we should all abide by that. Therefore, we are fully in line with the those rules that Treasury put out, and I really hope that they keep their nerve and execute those principles because those are the right principles, and we are fully supportive of that.And again, I'd like to stress that we are spending billions of dollars. We are -- and executing projects right now even before those rules come out, complying with those rules because we think they are the right rules, okay?"", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs."", 'Patrick Duffy Fischer', 'Question on cash flow, if I could. At least in the first quarter, cash flow was down or operating cash flow was down double digits even though earnings was up. Will that invert throughout the year? Would you expect operating cash flow to grow roughly at the same level of EPS this year?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Duffy, I'm glad you asked this question, but I'll have Melissa go through the details. But my friend, our EBITDA is going up. If our EBITDA is going up, the cash coming to the company is going up. What we are reporting is accounting and it's the timing of the cash. We report the number because we book it, but then we get the actual cash it's different because of our equity affiliates. But I think the best person to qualify to answer this, because I don't want to get into accounting details, Melissa, would you please explain that?"", 'Melissa N. Schaeffer', ""Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Seifi. So first of all, Duffy, so our EBITDA cash eversion is stable and our distributable and investment cash flow are both positive. So that's in line with our year-over-year EBITDA improvement. Additionally, we have industry-leading DSO, so all very strong. We did see an incremental reduction in our operating cash flow to EBITDA this quarter.There are a few items that attribute to this, namely it's really timing component related to our distributions of earnings for our large equity affiliate. Again, not an issue with profit, just timing. And the second one is we do manage and look to derisk our helium supply chain and then so we are building some of our helium inventory, which obviously has an offset to operating cash, but obviously, we'll attribute to process moving forward."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Okay, Duffy?', 'Patrick Duffy Fischer', 'You bet. And then just on the announcement that the EPA was given to the state of Louisiana the authority to deal with the CO2 sequestration there. Roughly, can you kind of explain how your relationship is with the state and how quickly you think that will speed up the process there and when we might get permits for Louisiana?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Duffy, I'm glad you asked that question. We are very excited about that. I think it was the right decision and that will cut about -- we think about a year on the time line of us getting the permit for the Class 6 well. And we do have an excellent relationship with the State of Louisiana, but it's not the relationship. We are going to do the right thing by having the State of Louisiana review that. We gain time because the State of Louisiana will have less Class 6 wells to deal with than EPA.So it's just a matter of the workload and they did the right thing by distributing the workload. Therefore, now the State of Louisiana will have fewer applications, and therefore, they can approve our project by about a year faster than the federal government would have done that. So that is why it is very helpful and very impactful and gives us a lot more confidence in terms of our ability to get the Class 6 permit if we need it."", 'Operator', ""We'll go to Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners."", 'Kevin William McCarthy', ""Seifi, I wanted to come back to the helium market dynamics. I heard your comments on the demand side. My question is, have you witnessed any material changes on the supply side of the global market such as the operating status of Gazprom's Amur project in Russia? Or is it strictly a function of demand in terms of the volume shortfall that you cited in the quarter?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, that is a very good question. Theoretically, whatever Amur produces in Russia, theoretically there is global sanctions on that. That, that is not supposed to be getting into the market. Is it getting into the market illegally and therefore increasing the supply of helium, and therefore that is why people are buying from other people?It could be the case. I am not sure. But the detailed dynamics on that are. And I don't want to be interpreting sanctions laws and all of that. But what you are suggesting is a possibility. We are looking into that. We haven't seen any significant factor from that yet, and at least we don't see it yet, but it might be the case."", 'Kevin William McCarthy', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, I had a few sort of housekeeping questions possibly for Melissa. I think you mentioned devaluation of the Argentine peso and we talked about the cost overrun from the sale of equipment project. Can you quantify the impact of some of those issues in the quarter?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""I don't think we want to quantify the details of every one of them, but the Argentine currency is easy. I'll answer that, make it a lot easy for Melissa, is that effect was about $10 million on our bottom line, for the Argentine currency about $0.03."", 'Kevin William McCarthy', 'Okay. And the SOE, no comment on that one?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""No, the rest of it, we don't want to break down how much was helium, how much was the sale of equipment and how much was the slowdown in China because then we will be giving you very too much competitive information, if you don't mind."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Patrick Cunningham from Citi."", 'Patrick David Cunningham', 'Could you maybe comment on the direction of price in Europe, how sustainable these margins are going forward?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, quite frankly, we did -- that is one of the areas where we did better than we expected. Our results in Europe are excellent, the margins are up 1,000 basis points, and that is because people have done a good job hanging on to the price while energy prices are going down. How this will develop in the future obviously depends on what happens to energy prices and so on. But I'm very proud of our people in terms of their performance and in terms of making sure that they maintain the pricing and we have been successful. And as Dr. Serhan was saying, our European business did very well during the quarter."", 'Patrick David Cunningham', 'Great. And then maybe just a related follow-up on the Uzbekistan project. How much volume was up on Uzbekistan? And what sort of contribution should we have throughout the year? I know previously you talked about $0.35 per share. How is Uzbekistan performing relative to your expectations?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Dr. Serhan, would you like to answer that?', 'Samir Jawdat Serhan', ""Yes. I just want to start by saying this project really has been a great fit for both Air Products and Uzbekistan. It leverages our core competencies and address the country's desire for energy independence and socioeconomic development.This project includes the world's largest ATRs, auto thermal reformer. And just to remind everybody, to produce blue hydrogen, you need to use auto-thermal reformers and those are the largest in the world, or you need to use (inaudible) units, which are the (inaudible), which is the technology we bought from GE gasification.We are excited about the operational and technological synergies by operating these large ATRs. The asset was brought onstream in October '23. We expect that to contribute around $0.35 for the full year."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Okay?', 'Operator', ""We'll go to Mike Sison from Wells Fargo."", 'Michael Joseph Sison', ""I guess my first question on fiscal '24 EPS growth, the projects that's recently come onstream before that you've noted in the slide, Are those contributing what you thought they would contribute in 2024? And I guess sort of the follow-up is that the delta between the 13% growth to the 6% to 9% growth now has nothing to do with the projects, more of the other stuff that you talked about in terms of headwinds?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, the thing is that -- I don't like to give you a general answer in the sense that if you're up year-on-year and in the meantime China is going down, helium volumes are lower and we have had these headwinds, then the only reason that it's going up is because some of the other projects are contributing, of course. So that's the way I would like to leave it with you, okay? Because, (inaudible) negatives and they are still going up. Therefore, the other projects are contributing, yes."", 'Michael Joseph Sison', ""Yes, that's great. And then beyond 2024, when you think about '25, '26, '27, more of a longer-term sort of view, how do you think the growth algorithm changes or maybe doesn't change as we look out of those years in terms of EPS growth?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""I think Air Products will deliver on the average an EPS growth of the 10% that we have delivered before. That's our goal. And one year, we might be 9%, one year we might be 11%. But overall, we are going to continue on that trend. And we promised that 10 years ago, we have delivered, and I fully expect that we will continue to deliver that."", 'Operator', ""We'll go to Laurence Alexander from Jefferies."", 'Daniel Rizzo', ""This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. I just want to make sure that of the projects under execution that's listed on Page 19, the next one that's going to come online is the one in Alberta, Canada, correct?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Yes. Alberta, Canada is the next one, which is going to come onstream. And as Dr. Serhan said, we expect that to be in fiscal year 2025.', 'Daniel Rizzo', ""Are there -- and this will be my second question, should the other projects come on right behind that? Or will there be, I don't know, year like delays? Or I'm just trying to think of the cadence as these are coming online."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, after that, we will have in '26 -- by the end of fiscal year '26, we will have -- by the end of calendar '26, we will have our green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia. The year after that, we will have our blue hydrogen project in Louisiana. And the year after that, we will have hopefully other projects that we will announce."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Laurent Favre from BNP."", 'Laurent Guy Favre', ""I'd like to go back to the SAF project, actually. I think you just mentioned that the start-up would be in 2027. In May last year, you had in, I guess, for startup in '25. And in August, it was still part of the group of projects that should be up and running by 2026. So I was wondering if you could talk about, I guess, what are the specific reasons for this more than 1 year delay. Is it the customer side? Or is it execution on your side?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Well, it is related to the fact that we are building this plant in California. And you know in California, it usually takes a long time to get permits. So it is dependent on the timing of the permits for construction for that facility. Once we have a final, final ruling on the permit, then we will be able to give you a definite date about when that plant is going to come onstream.', 'Laurent Guy Favre', 'And could you size for us the potential cost of a run on top of the $2.5 billion that was initially slated? Are we talking about a material difference?', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""I'm not sure I understood the question."", 'Siddharth Manjeshwar', ""No. I think Laurent, on that one, the capital, we earn the return on the capital of the project. We won't anticipate any capital update there."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'The return on the project is fixed. We are going to get a return on the capital that we spent, no matter what the capital is. Okay?', 'Operator', ""And we'll take our last question from Sebastian Bray from Berenberg."", 'Sebastian Christian Bray', ""My first one is on merchant pricing as it stands today. Is this stable in Europe or the U.S.? Has it started to decline? Or has it started to go up? The answer seems to be stable, but I wanted to double check.My second one is on guidance. Are we just assuming when setting the EPS growth rate guided for '24 the dollar rates as they stand today hold for the rest of the year?My third one is a more philosophical question on pricing. Is the desire to wait longer for the clean ammonia and clean hydrogen project offtake agreements a reaction to try and hedge out for risk that IRA subsidies maybe changed from '25, i.e., if that industry shakes out and it turns out the projects need clean -- higher clean hydrogen pricing to be economic with fewer subsidies available? Is the APD approach to say, well, we'll wait for the industry to shake out and see what comes?"", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Well, you're asking a very, very good question and I would like to tell you that we are the first mover in these projects. We are investing significant amount of money being the first mover. We -- obviously, my job is try to maximize return for the investors. And if we were the first mover and we took the risk, as they say, building these facilities before we had contracts, we should get rewarded by that and not just have projects which have the standard returns but be rewarded with a higher return. That's one thing.And then the second thing is that we genuinely believe that where we are in these projects, we will have a product which will be in significant demand as we get closer to people trying to comply with the rules that are already in place, in Europe especially. By 2028, a lot of the industries have to use the products that we make, and we don't see that many people making the product. So in that case, we are not in a hurry to give it away. Obviously, our job is to maximize profit for the company, get the best that we can, and that is the philosophy that we are following.It is not because of concerns about the other things that you mentioned, no. I think that the subsidies and so on are going to get enacted. Every day that goes by. You see the governments taking action. Recently it was Japan, before it has been Europe, it's well established, U.S. with the IRA. So events as you go forward every day points in the direction that hopefully our strategy is the right strategy, and we want to take maximum advantage of that."", 'Samir Jawdat Serhan', 'Actually Seifi, there has been report from the International Energy Agency that indicated that out of all of the projects announced for green hydrogen by 2030 to come onstream, only 7% will eventually come onstream by 2030.', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'Okay. Sorry, we gave you a long answer, but I hope we addressed your issue.', 'Sebastian Christian Bray', ""No, it's appreciated, Seifi. And the merchant pricing and the question on FX assumption for the rest of the year on a more tactical or short-term basis."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi', ""Yes. Well, that's again a very good question. We make our estimate -- Melissa, why don't you answer that?"", 'Melissa N. Schaeffer', 'Yes. So let me give you an answer on the merchant. So merchant-on-merchant pricing was up slightly. So we had stronger merchant-merchant pricing in the Americas and Asia, which was partially offset by some small decrease in Europe. However, I do want to mention that in Europe, our conversion margin stayed strong because the power cost decreased at a faster rate than our (technical difficulty) so the conversion margin maintain strong in all 3 regions.', 'Seifollah Ghasemi', 'And with respect to FX, when we give you an estimate, we give you an estimate based on the exchange rates as of today. So that is -- we are not assuming any significant change in the exchange rate.Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Operator, since there are no other questions, I would like to thank everybody for joining our call today. We again appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we look forward to discussing our results with you in 3 months. All the very best, and thank you for listening.', 'Operator', ""That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

Its bottom-line estimates imply a decline of 2.43% from the year-ago reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year rise of 3.93%.

The R&D and engineering expenses of the Accelera segment are likely to increase, thereby hurting the firm’s cash flows and margins in the to-be-reported quarter.

Our forecast for the segment’s EBITDA is $311.6 million, suggesting a rise from $256 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.For the quarter under discussion, we expect net sales from the Power System segment to be $1.42 billion, suggesting a rise from $1.32 billion recorded in fourth-quarter 2022. Our forecast for the segment’s EBITDA is $209.9 million, implying a rise from $185 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2022.Our projection of $3.24 billion for the Components segment’s quarterly net sales implies an increase from $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Voting for Blackwells’ nominees will ensure the Board has the support it requires across critical areas: media and content, real estate and asset optimization, and the proficiency to guide Disney through a new world where Physical, Spatial Computing and AI-driven Experiences converge,” said Jason Aintabi, Chief Investment Officer of Blackwells.', '“Only two of Disney’s non-executive directors have significant media experience, and, as a whole, the Board lacks the qualifications that our candidates possess. The Trian nominees, for their part, are uninspiring; Mr. Rasulo is a former Disney employee who plainly lacks relevant expertise. Mr. Peltz has spent the last two years begging Disney for a Board seat, and seems to focus his efforts on soliciting endorsements from Elon Musk- who doesn’t own a single Disney share, and is aggrieved at Disney for withholding advertising dollars from his struggling social media platform.

Ms. Schell spent 20 years in strategic and operating roles at three major entertainment companies - Warner Bros., NBC Universal, and The Walt Disney Company - focusing on the impact of technological change on content distribution and monetization. She served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment where she led the over one-billion-dollar global film division of home entertainment and expanded her remit over time to include television and originals. Ms. Schell transformed the primarily physical DVD business into a global digital transactional business, driving years of double digit annual digital growth. She also led Warner Bros’ top entertainment franchises into markets enabled by new technologies, including Virtual Reality, Internet of Things (IOT) connected entertainment devices, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

We believe there is no better suited person for the rest of the Board and management to leverage as Disney navigates the complex issues of integrating Hulu and Disney+ and the unbundling and transitioning of ESPN to a DTC service, and doubles down on producing extraordinary content for current and future franchises that has served as the creative engine driving all of Disney’s businesses.', 'Making the right choices about how to best use premium content to balance profitability, fan engagement, franchise strength and streaming subscriber acquisition and retention are skills that fall squarely in Ms. Schell’s wheelhouse, and she intends to deliver for Disney shareholders. We firmly believe Ms. Schell’s contributions as a director will help Disney attain Netflix like growth rates on subscribers and pricing for Disney+ based on her expertise, with meaningful upside to be unlocked by integrating Disney +, Hulu, and ESPN+.3', '', 'Real Estate and Strategic Asset Review', 'Disney has an almost unimaginable portfolio of real estate around the world.

From fewer original series and movies to greater scrutiny of budgets and a further squeeze on movie theater profits, people who call the shots said the television and film industries are adjusting to sober economic realities.', '“The great contraction is upon us,” said one veteran television executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. “I think there will be a significant retrenchment in the quantity of content, and the amount spent on content.”', 'The contraction story will figure prominently as Walt Disney , Warner Bros Discovery and Fox report quarterly results this month. It is also the backdrop for media merger chatter, most recently sale talks between the owner of Paramount Global and Skydance Media CEO David Ellison, the media mogul whose studio co-produced “Top Gun: Maverick.”', 'Analyst TD Cowen estimated broadcast and cable television advertising will end 2023 down 7% from the prior year, with total advertising declines of 11.7% at Disney, according to LSEG. Warner Bros Discovery reported a 13% decline in advertising for the first nine months of 2023. Along with print and radio, traditional TV has been “hollowed out” by digital advertising.', 'The outlook for 2024 is not much better. TD Cowen forecast that broadcast and cable TV ad revenue would fall another 7%. Even though the media companies are expanding their digital ad businesses, the sinking traditional TV business still accounts for 80% of their total advertising revenue, according to TD Cowen.', 'Streaming services, which were supposed to carry the industry into the future, are also struggling to reach profitability after years of profligate spending. As the industry enters what MoffettNathanson describes as the “third act of the streaming wars,” production spending will fall below 2022 levels, when competition stoked ""never sustainable"" investment.', 'Most streaming services are charging more while delivering less new content, feeding skepticism over their long-term strategy, according to TD Cowen.', 'The overall number of scripted series is expected to shrink dramatically from the pinnacle of 633 shows released in 2022. The combination of the Hollywood strikes and constrained spending dented production last year, with just 481 U.S. series released in 2023, according to data from market research firm Ampere Analysis.', 'Even market-leading Netflix slashed the number of scripted series it released by more than one-third from 2022 to 2023, Ampere said. The profitable streaming service, which reported record subscriber gains in its fourth quarter, declined to comment.', 'Executives who spoke to Reuters said the industry could shed more scripted series and hit the 300-shows range in coming years.', 'In 2024, the domestic box office will continue to feel the impact of the actors and writers strikes, with just 90 films offered for wide release this year, down from around 100 in 2023, according to MoffettNathanson. With a film slate heavy in untested stories and characters, U.S. box office sales are expected to be $8 billion in 2024, down 10% from 2023 and down 30% from 2019.', '‘NEW WORLD ORDER’', 'The industry is slowing down, executives said. Development executives are taking longer to greenlight shows, even for projects from established showrunners like Ronald D. Moore, whose credits include “For All Mankind” and “Outlander.”', 'Production budgets are contracting -- including at the streaming service Apple TV+, whose cash-flush corporate parent, Apple, boasts a market capitalization of $3 trillion. Both examples are reported here for the first time.', 'Shows that fail to grab an audience are being canceled quicker, as with the Disney+ series “American Born Chinese,” an adaptation of a groundbreaking graphic novel featuring two Oscar winners, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan.', 'One senior television agent called it “the new world order,” with shorter seasons and fewer episodes per season.', 'Fox is looking to slash spending on one prestige drama to $4.5 million per episode from $10 million. At Disney, where CEO Bob Iger is fending off activist shareholders, development executives are under deeper scrutiny.', '“They’re all a bit scared about what to do next,” said one prominent talent manager.', '""SUPERHERO FATIGUE""', 'The movie business is having its own existential crisis as once reliable formats have fallen flat at the box office. One longtime studio chief said he has been hearing for years about “superhero fatigue.” That was in full display last year, when a procession of big-budget but poorly received films, including “The Marvels,” “Shazam: Fury of the Gods” and “The Flash,” fell short of expectations.', 'In response, industry insiders say studios will focus on fewer but more ambitious endeavors, with the potential to deliver “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie”-sized cultural and box-office impact. Both films helped prop up a 2023 box office where well-established franchises fell flat.', ""“You've got to have a spectacle,” said one studio executive associated with one of the biggest blockbusters in recent years. “It’s got to be, ‘You have to see it while it’s in the theater.’ We can’t greenlight something large scale, if you could probably watch this at home and it’s just as good.”"", 'Audiences are gravitating to streaming services to watch all but the biggest, loudest, films, noted TD Cowen. Just 19 action/adventure films accounted for 56% of the total box office for the top 100 films of 2022. The outlook for a sustained recovery, beyond this type of high-adrenaline flick, is questionable, TD Cowen noted.', 'That will further constrain cinemas, said another longtime media executive and investor, who warned there will be too few films released to justify maintaining 39,000 screens in the U.S., a sentiment echoed by TD Cowen. The theater business, this executive said, is “teetering on disaster.” (Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, edited by Kenneth Li and David Gregorio)']"

They've already signaled to the Street that subs should be down in the quarter based on price hikes they had toward the end of the year and probably what wasn't a super great content slate in the quarter. They've also said that in the early part of the year, kind of sequential loss improvement is probably going to be moderate. So I think they've set the stage pretty well for what people should expect.

When we look at their content slate for the next nine months, it\'s a little bare. They\'ve got content. They\'ve got two live action ""Star Wars"" shows two live action Marvel shows. But none of them are featuring characters that I would say are big draws. Their film slate last year performed not terribly well.

Not that they've been bad, but they have a complicated story, and they need someone who can tell it well."", ""It'll be interesting to see if they get more specific with their forward guidance.

But they don't like guide to an EBITDA number or revenue number or anything like that normally. Maybe they'll get a little bit more-- a little bit more clear on what they expect, and that might help the stock in the near term. Of course, then they have to deliver, which is the tricky part."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And, Doug, does-- I mean, Disney are already, as you said, the challenges are pretty well-known.

And now I'll turn it over to Chris."", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', ""Thank you, and good morning, everyone. When we gathered at this time last year, we shared that despite a challenging operating environment, McDonald's continued to deliver historically high levels of growth. While macroeconomic pressures persisted throughout 2023, the resilience and power of our system was on full display and we are heading into the new year in a position of strength. In 2023, we achieved global comp sales growth of 9%, delivered guest count performance of nearly 3% globally with positive traffic across each of our segments and maintained our leading market share across most of our major markets. These results are a credit to the tireless dedication of the entire McDonald's system: the over 2 million talented people working in our restaurants, the industry's best franchisees and our world-class network of suppliers around the world, all executing with excellence and with an unwavering commitment to serving our customers and local communities. And in our restaurants, focusing on the fundamentals of creating an exceptional customer experience has delivered operational improvements, improved service times and increased customer satisfaction across almost all of our major markets. Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, fueling over 30% comparable sales growth since 2019, and our MCD growth pillars enable us to remain agile in response to changing customer needs. For example, we've expanded loyalty to 50 markets around the world and reached over $20 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales in 2023. Our user base continues to grow with over 150 million users that have been active in the last 90 days, making us one of the largest loyalty programs in the world. Over the last 3 years, we've also delivered tremendous growth in chicken by developing the McCrispy, a globally consistent high-quality chicken sandwich. With the goal of solving this unmet customer need across the system, it was developed and tested in a few markets first and has quickly scaled to a $1 billion brand across more than 30 markets worldwide. Our chicken category now represents $25 billion in annual system-wide sales on par with beef. And about a year ago, we formed a new business ventures team designed to operate as an entrepreneurial start-up within McDonald's. The team quickly identified an opportunity in a $100 billion category across our top 6 markets that comprise of beverage-led occasions where our core McDonald's business under indexes. In a little less than a year, the team opened a pilot CosMc's restaurant and the buzz has been electric. Now let me say this again: we're only talking about a 10-store test. But more than that, we are excited about what this says about our potential to test, learn and innovate quickly. Each of these examples illustrate our ability to identify opportunities and adopt new ways to surprise and delight our customers. It gives us an incredible amount of resilience as a system no matter where the customer goes next or what the macroeconomic landscape may bring. In the last year, we also implemented Accelerating the Organization, an effort to modernize the way we work so that we're faster, more innovative and more efficient. And over the past year, as I've had the opportunity to visit markets around the world, I've witnessed how the principles of AtO have empowered our teams to take the right risk, lead in innovation and reduce complexity in decision-making. Some of the senior leadership team and I recently visited Salt Lake City, and I witnessed firsthand how knowledge-sharing across the system is unlocking speed and driving customer lifetime value. The business unit is part of our Denver field office, which as a whole has embraced the power of digital, maximizing our platform to drive frequency and engagement with customers. This means that the restaurants can take full advantage of Ready On Arrival. In addition to a national average 60-second reduction in wait times for customers that pick up curbside in our restaurant where higher customer satisfaction in these transactions, Ready On Arrival benefits the crew by giving the right information to the right person in the restaurant to deliver food faster and hotter. As a result, we've reduced complexity and stress in restaurants and Salt Lake franchisees are driving higher levels of guest count growth and franchisee cash flow. By removing layers between our people and the restaurants and implementing a One McDonald's Way approach, collaborating across the organization is much more intuitive and teams bring the full breadth of McDonald's resources, skills and experiences to the forefront when making decisions. And as critical as this power of global scale is to our competitive advantage, at our core, we are a global business that is run by local small business owners that employ thousands within their communities. Since the beginning of our brand's history, McDonald's and our franchisees have been steadfast in the support of our communities in the most challenging times. And whether it was the recent earthquake in Japan, the tragedies that struck Morocco and Hawaii last year or the war in the Middle East, our focus is on creating a positive impact in the communities we serve. Across the more than 75 markets in our IDL segment, McDonald's is a major employer of local citizens, creating valuable career opportunities for more than 780,000 local employees in both restaurant and office jobs and at more than 1,000 locally owned suppliers. We're proud to grow that footprint. In 2023, the IDL segment opened an average of 4 new restaurants every single day, creating new jobs for nearly 50,000 people this year alone. And by removing barriers for children who need health care, Ronald McDonald House Charities helped to provide essential services for over 870,000 families across this segment. For the over 130,000 workers in our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, our #1 priority is keeping our people safe. We recognize that families and their communities in the region continue to be tragically impacted by the war, and our thoughts are with them at this time. McDonald's has always been a beacon in our communities around the world, led by local franchisees who work tirelessly to serve and support. The ongoing impact of the war on these franchisees' local businesses is disheartening and ill founded. As our value states, McDonald's will always proudly open our doors to everyone. Thinking back on 2023, I can't help but feel tremendous pride in the entire McDonald's system. And as we think about our ambitions and the potential that lies ahead, there's never been a better time to be part of brand McDonald's. As I will continue to say, we believe there is still significant runway in our Accelerating the Arches strategy and we're setting our sights even higher. I'll speak more on the year ahead in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn it over to Ian to talk through our Q4 results."", 'Ian Frederick Borden', ""Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned just a few minutes ago, core to Accelerating the Arches strategy is putting the customer at the center of every decision we make, acting with agility in any environment to deliver delicious feel-good moments at an affordable price each and every day. Our quarter 4 comp sales performance of over 4% in both the U.S. and IOM segments and over 3% globally remains a direct result of exceptional execution against this strategy, making it clear once again that our business is resilient despite ongoing macro pressures and challenges. As a system, we've navigated countless challenging environment since we first opened our doors in 1955. This past quarter was no exception, and our thoughts remain with the families and communities impacted by the war in the Middle East. As Chris and I have both mentioned before, the war has meaningfully impacted our IDL segment performance, resulting in fourth quarter comp sales of less than 1%. Despite this, our business model provides stability in our P&L from the negative sales impact in the region. Among the many strategic advantages of McDonald's are our size, scale and geographic diversity translating to incredible resilience as a system. We will continue to stay focused on supporting our people and the local communities in which we operate as we work closely with our DL partners in the region. We are extremely proud of the way our system continues to consistently show up for customers in every corner of the world, highlighting time and time again the strength of the McDonald's brand when our system comes together. Providing our customers with affordable options has always been core to our brand, and it's even more important as consumers feel pressure on their spending, particularly the lower-income consumer. We continue to listen to our customers by evolving our value offerings, maintaining strong perceptions in value for money and affordability. Canada, for example, maintained their McMuffin and hot coffee pairing this quarter, providing an affordable bundle during a critical daypart and helping to drive market share gains in breakfast. The U.K. followed a similar playbook by expanding their Saver Meals Deals to offer smaller bundles during the morning daypart for just a few pounds. Only available through our mobile app, this further cemented McDonald's U.K. as a destination for great food at great value while contributing to increased loyalty sales. The U.K. also combined the strength of the McDonald's brand with its proven history of connecting with customers through successful holiday marketing to create Festive Wins, an elevated in-app experience that leaned into the holiday spirit with a fun and interactive calendar promotion. Through a combination of daily deals, compelling prices and exclusive merchandise, Festive Wins boosted digital engagement to an all-time high for the market and generated 4 million active monthly customers. And in Australia, the market brought back its 30 Days 30 Deals promotion, where customers enjoyed a daily deal available exclusive in the MyMc's app. From discounts on our most iconic menu items like the Big Mac, cheeseburger or our world-famous French fries to unique meal deals, the promotion drove remarkable engagement and contributed to a record number of active loyalty members in the market. Beyond maintaining an affordable price point, we're constantly elevating the McDonald's experience, enhancing the overall value proposition of the brand. This was evident as many markets offered Monopoly this quarter, leveraging learnings from across the globe to create highly interactive campaigns and once again igniting our fan's love for McDonald's. The Canadian market tapped into global best practices by offering Monopoly with a Double Peel option for the first time this year by giving customers a second chance to win in the app. The market continued to amplify the digital experience while maintaining those core qualities of the game that our customers love. The customer excitement was on full display, and the market achieved record-setting results generating nearly 700,000 new app customers in just 5 weeks and driving significant lifts in mobile app sales. In fact, more than 43 million Monopoly codes were digitally redeemed during the promotion. That's more than the entire population of Canada. Germany also experienced record-breaking registrations with their Monopoly program by combining iconic peel off game pieces with the ability to scan to win prices in the mobile app. And for the first time, Germany offered loyalty points as prizes, rewarding our customers and driving additional digital customer frequency. And in France, Monopoly drove additional loyalty sales with an interactive redemption experience for our customers. We continue to navigate a difficult operating environment in the market, where results have softened and comp sales were negative for the quarter. Moving forward, we're confident that we have the right leadership team in place with the right experience to reset with our franchisees who I know are committed to restoring our strong foundation. We are acting with a sense of urgency to address our opportunities and maintaining a growth mindset in critical areas like value, core menu and delivery. Our One McDonald's Way approach to marketing extends beyond Monopoly as we continue to drive brand strength building cultural relevance and connecting with our customers and crew in new and exciting ways. This quarter, we once again tapped into the nostalgic McDonald's experience of enjoying a Happy Meal as a kid and recreated it for our adult fans featuring our core menu favorites at the center. Originally launched in the U.S. in 2022, we brought back the campaign to the market in December, partnering with artists and creator, Kerwin Frost, and scaling it to 15 additional markets, including Canada. The excitement for the return of this event was evident, driving a significant social media engagement across many of our channels. And by encouraging our customers to trade up with a full margin promotion, we fueled top line growth with a strong average check lift. In an environment where our customers are looking to familiar favorites, those core menu items have never been more relevant or beloved. At the center of our core menu are an iconic portfolio of brands, $17 billion brands in their own right, including 4 different chicken equities that are each $1 billion brands. We continue to stay aggressive on chicken this quarter, making further progress towards our ambition of developing a reputation for great chicken. Germany rehit the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich with strong results driving a lift in chicken sandwich sales and building additional customer affinity for the product. And the U.K. built on its market leadership in chicken by extending the McCrispy brand with a limited time offering, the McCrispy Smokehouse, combining new and exciting flavors and ingredients with our core chicken offerings. In China, with slowing macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence near record lows, the market continued to build brand equity by combining our delicious food with culture and community through a collaboration with local street wear designer, Verdy. The campaign not only featured access to exclusive merchandise, but put our delicious chicken at the center and drove incremental traffic into our restaurants by offering customers a discount on a second order. Turning to our P&L. Our top line growth drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.95 for the quarter. This is an increase over the prior year of 11% in constant currencies excluding current year charges of almost $140 million for write-offs of impaired software no longer in use and charges related to our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy. Foreign currency translation positively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.07 per share. For the full year, adjusted operating margin was just over 47%, reflecting higher restaurant margin dollars across all segments. Despite the significant P&L pressures that we've discussed throughout the year, top line results generated $14 billion of restaurant margin for the year, an increase of about 10% in constant currency. Lastly, before I hand it back over to Chris, I want to touch briefly on our capital expenditures and free cash flow profile. Our CapEx spend for the year was approximately $2.4 billion with more than half invested in new unit development across our U.S. and IOM segments. After reinvesting in the business, our free cash flow conversion was in the 90% range for the year. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris."", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', ""Thanks, Ian. As we look to 2024 with elevated absolute prices and muted consumer confidence, we believe that consumers will continue to be more discriminating with their dollars. But we expect our focus on our MCDs will continue to drive growth across our business. And from a historical perspective, we know our resilience is rooted in our ability to adapt in any environment. McDonald's is one of the world's most recognized and most beloved brands, providing delicious meals at an affordable price and showing up when and where customers need us. By building a One McDonald's Way approach to marketing and creative excellence, we will continue to scale the best ideas globally through common tools and processes that help us maximize return on investment and that shine a light on what people love about McDonald's. We're creating an environment that embraces bold creative and we're remaining connected to culture by tapping into the moments, memories, rituals and behaviors that people have with our brand. And McDonald's position on value is a competitive advantage. With a strategy rooted in customer behaviors and insights, we are optimizing price while limiting customer resistance. As we continue to attract millions of new loyalty members, we can get even smarter with our pricing methodology and tailor our digital offers to our fans, making them even more personalized. Looking ahead, we'll also continue to make our core menu even more enticing. With initiatives like Best Burger, we've made small changes that are adding up to big differences that our customers are really noticing. Best Burger is now deployed across more than 70 markets, including the U.S., and we're excited about the potential for growth as it deploys to nearly all markets by 2026. And as we look to build on our leadership in beef, we're addressing an unmet customer need across markets for larger, high-quality burgers. We're working horizontally across the system to innovate. As we test and learn, we'll be working to understand how the new offering will complement our already established burgers like the Double QPC or the Big Tasty. We're also excited to further build on our success in chicken by continuing to invest in beloved icons like McNuggets and McChicken while further scaling emerging favorites like McCrispy and McSpicy. These 4 equities are the building blocks of our growing chicken business, and we see the potential to add another point of chicken share by 2026, in part through an expansion of our McCrispy platform into wraps and tenders. We've made incredible progress across our 4Ds by taking the things our customers love about McDonald's from convenience to personal connections with our brand and making them even better. For example, Ready On Arrival will expand across our top 6 markets by the end of 2025. And while we build one of the largest loyalty programs in the world in just a few years, over 150 million active users today represents only a fraction of our total customers. We aim to reach 250 million active users and $45 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales by the end of 2027. And as you heard during our investor update, the world's largest restaurant company is planning to grow even faster over the next 4 years. We know our ambition to reach 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027 is a compelling opportunity, and we've done our homework. We've identified key areas with high population growth and lower store density across both our IOM and U.S. segments, and that's where we're starting. These opportunities before us in the near term are compelling. But as we plan for long-term growth and solidify McDonald's leadership position, we've introduced 3 new platforms that will become part of Accelerating the Arches: to build on our competitive advantages, cement our place in culture and stay one step ahead of the next generation of digital customers. This includes building one of the largest consumer platforms in the world to attract and retain highly valuable digital and loyalty customers. The easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform that puts intuitive technology in the hands of our restaurant teams and drives a better experience for both our customers and our crew and a company platform that unlocks speed and innovation. We believe our biggest opportunity to advance and acquire new customers and build more meaningful customer relationships that result in greater frequency and spending is continuing to aggressively invest in digital and technology as a 3-legged stool. For our customers, we will better leverage the data we have across our loyalty program to provide targeted offers and personalized experiences, building relationships with the customers that we serve every single day and ensuring that they enjoy a more familiar, consistent experience no matter where they go or how they were. For restaurant, it's investing to put the most intuitive technology in the hands of our restaurant teams that makes their jobs easier and empowers them to provide amazing hospitality while serving hot and accurate orders to customers even faster. And for the company, it is building the systems, processes and tools that will enable our people to be more efficient and innovate with speed and agility. As I've said before, these are bold plans, but our success tomorrow has always depended on our ability to stay ahead of our customers' changing needs while reimagining what a restaurant can be. We're building the engine that will power McDonald's ability to unleash the full strength of our global scale where it counts. I'll now turn it back over to Ian to talk through our 2024 financial outlook."", 'Ian Frederick Borden', ""Thanks, Chris. As we've discussed, we continue to operate in a challenging environment with varying levels of headwinds across our markets. Looking ahead to this year, we anticipate these headwinds will continue as the current macro dynamics continue to weigh on both our consumers and our business results along with the war in the Middle East. As we navigate these ongoing challenges, continuing to execute at the highest level with a laser focus towards growing market share will be critical. It's clear that we've had exceptional success over the last 4 years with strong broad-based momentum and global comp sales of over 30% when compared to 2019. It's truly remarkable. But as we've mentioned before, we anticipate 2024 comp sales growth will continue to moderate as we return to a more normalized level of growth with expectations closer to historical averages of between 3% and 4% in our U.S. and IOM segments. And in IDL, we do not expect to see meaningful improvement until there is a resolution in the Middle East. We expect our net restaurant expansion in 2024, along with restaurants we opened in 2023, will contribute nearly 2% to system-wide sales growth as we begin to accelerate our new unit development and make progress against our target of 50,000 restaurants by 2027. With expectations of moderating sales growth and ongoing inflationary headwinds, we expect our company-operated margin percent will remain pressured in the near term and we expect the full year 2024 company-operated margin percent will be relatively in line with 2023. Turning to G&A. The financial strength of our system enables us to invest in areas that will drive long-term efficiencies for our people and for our stakeholders. We expect 2024 G&A as a percentage of system-wide sales to be about 2.2%, which reflects elevated investments in technology, digital and Global Business Services or GBS. Through these investments, we'll look to run the business more efficiently over time and ultimately free up more resource to continue to drive long-term growth. Despite headwinds throughout the P&L, we anticipate an operating margin of mid- to high 40% in 2024, driven primarily by top line growth and franchise margin performance. We're projecting interest expense this year to increase between 9% and 11% compared to 2023 due to higher average debt balances and interest rates. And we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be between 20% and 22%. Transitioning to capital expenditures, we plan to spend between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion this year, more than half of which will be dedicated to new unit openings across our U.S. and IOM segments. Globally, we plan to open more than 2,100 restaurants this year with about 500 of these openings in our U.S. and IOM segments, where we continue to see strong returns. We also expect to open more than 1,600 restaurants in our IDL segment this year, including about 1,000 in China, where we recently completed the acquisition of Carlyle's 28% stake in McDonald's China. We're excited to have increased our minority ownership to 48% in our second largest and fastest-growing market and believe it will enable us to further benefit from the market's long-term potential. Overall, we anticipate about 4% unit growth driven by more than 1,600 net restaurant additions in 2024. And finally, we expect to generate strong cash flow in 2024 with free cash flow conversion in the 90% range. Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, investing in the business to drive growth. This includes both capital expenditures as well as increased cash investments in technology, digital and GBS. Second, returning all remaining free cash flow through dividends and share buybacks over time. While the macro environment remains challenging, we believe that our Accelerating the Arches strategy is the right playbook, and we continue to maximize our M, C and D growth pillars to drive strong results. We have confidence that our competitive strengths and our ability to continue to evolve to stay ahead of the customer positions us to succeed in any economic environment, delivering long-term growth for our system and our shareholders. Now let me turn it back over to Chris to close."", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', 'For nearly 70 years, the McDonald\'s story has been one of growth: a first job for millions, the best franchising opportunity in the world and a familiar beacon of support for the over 40,000 communities we serve. In fact, our U.S. business generated 1.4 million jobs and contributed $108 billion to the U.S. GDP in the last year alone. Even as the world around us continues to change, the power of our brand has stood the test of time. That\'s because McDonald\'s continues to reinvent itself and stay one step ahead of our customers. While our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, we will only keep growing when we\'re continuing to take smart risks and operating with a long-term mindset. Ray Kroc said it best, ""The only way we can advance is by going forward, individually and collectively, in the spirit of the pioneer in the pride of accomplishment."" Even with all that we\'ve accomplished since the launch of Accelerating the Arches, I am confident that there is so much more that we could achieve. I look forward to coming together with all 3 legs of our stool at our upcoming worldwide convention this April to share how we will reimagine our future together. Thank you to our franchisees, suppliers and employees whose passion and dedication is central to bringing the McDonald\'s experience to life for our customers each and every day. With that, we\'ll take questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)', 'Mike Cieplak', 'Our first question is from David Palmer with Evercore.', 'David Sterling Palmer', ""Probably just a two-parter. Quickly, do you think that there's any impact from boycotts to IOM results anywhere even if they're slight? And then separately, the multiyear trends this year have been stable for a lot of the year, basically since the second quarter. I'm really thinking the U.S., very strong multiyear trend. So there's no shame in these remaining stable. I'm just wondering if there -- if you think that there is a reason for those trends to reaccelerate or there's a lesson in that maybe your best play because, obviously, we're dealing through some very noisy months here with weather and whatnot over the fourth quarter and here in January. So I'm wondering how you're viewing that with the goal perhaps being that multiyear trend can reaccelerate into '24 and your best play to make that happen."", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', ""Hey, David, it's Chris. Thanks for the questions. First, on your question about the Middle East, obviously, the place that we're seeing the most pronounced impact is in the Middle East. We are seeing some impact in other Muslim countries like Malaysia, Indonesia. And then as far as IOM impact, it depends on the country. So in a country, for example, like France that has a larger Muslim population, we are seeing some impact in France. It depends very much on where the restaurant is located and if it's in a Muslim area, but we are seeing some impact there. And then in other countries like Spain, like in Italy, we're seeing no impact. So it really depends very much on the country. But as I said, the most pronounced impact that we're seeing is in the Middle East and in Muslim countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. Also, as we said, in our prepared remarks, our outlook is, so long as this conflict, this war is going on, we're not making any plans. We're not expecting to see any significant improvement in this. It's a human tragedy what's going on. And I think that, that does weigh on brands like ours. Back to your other question about potentially a reacceleration, as we also said in the prepared remarks and we also talked about at Investor Day, we're expecting 2024 to be normalizing comp sales growth in that kind of 3% to 4% range, which is where we've been more historically. So we certainly had great performance over whether you look at it on a 2-year horizon, a 4-year horizon, 30-plus percent on a 4-year horizon, call it, 14% or so on a 2-year horizon. So feel great about that. But I think we are moving into a 2024 that's going to look more like what you would have considered a typical year prior to COVID and all the things that have gone on."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.', 'John William Ivankoe', ""The question is on France. And France has obviously been a leading market for McDonald's in a lot of ways for a couple of decades now, and in some cases, has actually been a leading indicator of positive performance in other markets of things that were done in France that were then copied by others quite successfully -- implemented by others quite successfully. So it did sound like you had some self-help in France: value, core menu and delivery. I mean did you find yourself, I guess, kind of catching up from behind in some of those metrics? I wanted to understand a little bit more maybe what you could have done differently in the fourth quarter to improve results. And do you think possibly there could be some leading indicators in France that are happening now within the market, of course, excluding the Middle East sentiment, that maybe we can apply to other markets to ensure those markets don't dip negative in the near term?"", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', ""Sure. Thanks for the question. You're right in pointing out France for us has been historically one of our best markets. We have some of our highest customer satisfaction in that market. We have some of our highest franchising cash flows in that market. We're not happy with our performance in France right now. And if I were to isolate 2 areas that we are focused on to improve in France, the first is we did get offsides on value there. The team has done a very nice job in pivoting and just put in place a new value program there that we're seeing great early success with that. But certainly, that was a reaction and we don't want to see that. And then second, we continue to have operations opportunities in France and that's something that we've been having a lot of engagement on with our franchisees. So as I think about IOM, certainly lessons there. But on the positive side, France is certainly our most pressured market right now in France -- or in IOM, but I also feel very good that we're going to get that business back on track and continue to have the performance that we've become accustomed to in that market over many, many years."", 'Ian Frederick Borden', ""And maybe, John, I'll just build on a bit on Chris' comments. I mean, I think 2 things. One is as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've got almost an entirely new leadership team in place in the market, a team that has a tremendous amount of McDonald's business experience and we have a lot of confidence in that team and the experience they bring, I think, to drive the right catalyst. I think when you have a market that maybe is a little bit off track, what you look to have you got the right people with the right experience to drive change and then do you feel like you have clarity of sight to the kind of underlying issues that you need to address. And I think on both of those fronts, we feel good. Obviously, as Chris spoke about, it's going to kind of take a moment to get momentum going back in the right direction. But I know together with our franchisees in France, we're going to be aggressive to kind of go after the opportunities that we exist. And I think we're very, very aligned in how we're approaching that with them."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.', 'Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein', ""Great. Chris, question as we think about 2024. First, I just wanted to clarify, I think you mentioned 3% to 4% comps in the U.S. and IOM. I'm not used to seeing such specific guidance, so that's encouraging. But I'm wondering if you could share any thoughts on the components of that between pricing, which we get the sense is easing versus traffic.And then just more broadly, the operating margin guidance from mid- to high 40% range, let's say, fairly wide, I guess, 500 basis points or so range. I'm just wondering if you can help narrow or perhaps talk about what would lead margins to be at the upper versus lower end of that wide range."", 'Ian Frederick Borden', ""It's Ian. So let me take that. I think as we talked about on the comps in our opening remarks, I think -- and we've been talking about it, as you know, pretty consistently over the last couple of quarters, as inflation levels have come down and obviously our pricing broadly is coming down in line with kind of inflation getting back to what I'll call more normal levels, I think that's why we talk about comps kind of getting back to more of that historical norm range of 3% to 4% in both the U.S. and IOM this year. I mean I think the only texture I'd give you there is we had a slower start to the year. I think there are a couple of important reasons for that. Firstly, we had a really strong start to 2023. So obviously, we're lapping against that. And then I think you'll remember a year ago, we talked about just the abnormally mild weather that we were dealing with as a tailwind benefit in beginning of '23 in both North America and Europe, and so we're obviously working against that as well. I think if I was to think about the year, I think about the back half of the year probably being slightly stronger -- slightly stronger than probably the front half. Just again, we had an incredibly strong first 2 quarters of 2023 that we're working against. And I think some of the macro factors that were -- are going to impact us in 2024 could, I think, be slightly easing towards the back half of this year versus the front half. On op margin, look, I mean if you go back to 2019, I think we've had a pretty strong demonstration of what we will continue to talk about, which is, over time, certainly believe we continue to be able to drive leverage and op margin as we get the strong top line growth. If you go back to 2019, we were kind of in that 44-ish percent range. We ended last year at just over 47%. I think that's a pretty strong proof point of our ability to continue to grow margins as we look forward on a percentage basis. I think obviously, as Chris talked about 2024, we've got some headwinds to work through, but feel really confident about our ability to continue to grow margins over time."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.', 'David E. Tarantino', ""My question is on the impacts you're seeing in the Middle East. I guess 2 questions. One, could you help to quantify your estimate on how much that impacted your sales in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, could you comment on the health of your franchisees in the areas that have been most impacted and whether you think some temporary assistance will be needed as you move through 2024?"", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', ""Hey, David, it's Chris. Just -- I'll do a couple of things and then let Ian clean up whatever I missed. But we're not going to get into specific numbers on the Middle East. But suffice to say, as you see in our IDL results, you can infer that the impact is meaningful, as I said also in our employee note at the beginning of this year. And then in terms of health of the franchisees, we're really fortunate in that we have some very strong, very well-capitalized franchisees in the Middle East. But as we have historically done, as we work through challenges around the world, you've seen us in partnership with franchisees do things to support them during difficult periods that sometimes can be deferrals, sometimes it can be other forms of support. And so those are ongoing conversations that we'll have with our franchisees. We believe that working in partnership with our franchisees and doing things together through good times and bad is the way that we've been successful over time. So it's going to be very much a situation-by-situation approach that we have in the Middle East, but certainly, the impact right now is significant. And Ian, I'll pass it off to you for anything else you want to add."", 'Ian Frederick Borden', ""Yes. Thanks, Chris. So maybe just a couple of builds to that. I mean, David, you know that, as I've talked about before, I think we've got an incredibly resilient business model. Obviously, if you look back over the last several years, we've had to work through a number of different external challenges, and I think the geographic breadth, the size and scale of our business and our financial strength means we're in a position of strength to kind of work through any of these challenges, including the one that we're currently facing in the Middle East with the war that's going on. In regards to kind of support for franchisees or DL partners, as I've talked about before, I mean, providing support is part of our business model. It's obviously how we work together with our franchisees when conditions outside of their control warrant support. But when we do that, it's always, as you know, targeted and temporary and designed, obviously, to go to owner-operators or partners who are most in need. I think as Chris said, we've got some incredibly strong partners in the Middle East, the majority of those partners have been with us for 20 years or more. We've worked through a variety of challenges over the years. And I think we'll continue to be focused on supporting our team members in the region, working with the communities that we do business in and working closely with the DL partners to get through this together. And I'm very, very confident that we'll do that."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.', 'Eric Andrew Gonzalez', ""I'm wondering maybe if you could comment on China specifically. I know it's not a huge part of your profit today, but you do have some big growth aspirations in that country. So if you could comment on some of the macro challenges that you're seeing and how they're impacting results in that country? And maybe talk about how the brand is positioned to gain share in that market."", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', ""Sure. Well, overall, we had a very good 2023 in China. We were happy with how our business performed in China. We're seeing strong growth there. We also built 1,000 restaurants in China. So we're very much on track from our development aspirations and we would expect to do something similar in 2024 from that standpoint. So overall headline is feel good about what we're seeing in China and the progress in growth. Certainly, in China, as you've read about and seen it with a number of other companies, consumer sentiment in the country is a little bit more under pressure right now. And that is leading to -- in Q4, in particular, we saw the environment get more promotional. We didn't necessarily follow that, but certainly the environment is getting more promotional. And our focus is on making sure that we remain competitive. So we're going to do what we need to do to maintain our competitiveness in that market. But if you think about the overall macro trends in China, I talked about this at Investor Day, we certainly think that we're going to continue to see good comp performance in that market as consumer wealth and GDP continue to grow mid-single digits. We think there's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to build out development and penetration in that market to many places where we don't really have McDonald's presence. So overall outlook on China for us continues to be very robust, which is why we increased our stake, as Ian mentioned."", 'Ian Frederick Borden', ""I might just add on a couple of things to Chris. I mean first, I would just acknowledge the team and our team in China, we opened just over 1,000 restaurants in 2023, which was an all-time high for us. And as Chris mentioned, as we talked about in our remarks, we completed the acquisition of the additional 28% to take our stake to 48% at the end of January. And I think we continue to remain really optimistic about the long-term opportunity there and our ability to have an increased stake in that long-term opportunity with that additional stake acquisition. And we're looking forward to getting that market to 10,000 restaurants by end of 2028, which is, I think, a really important milestone as we look forward."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'Our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.', 'Brian James Harbour', ""Yes. Maybe I'll just ask about the U.S. Are you willing to say kind of where pricing was in the fourth quarter and also into the first quarter? And also any color you can provide by daypart, I think we've heard some other companies talking more about late night or if you perhaps have any comments on breakfast recently?"", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', ""Sure. Well, I'll kind of just give some macro comments. Again, have Ian pick any details. But certainly, we've continued to work through pricing in the U.S. as we were looking to offset inflation. We saw what I would describe as mid- to high single-digit price increases last year. It depends a little bit on where you were in the country, but mid- to high single-digit pricing. We are seeing, as I've talked about on prior calls, that particularly among the low-income consumer, there's some transaction size reduction that we're seeing. We're also seeing some trade down there. So that offset a little bit of the pricing -- the absolute pricing that we took. But I think as you think about 2024, certainly, inflation is going to be less, probably in the low single-digit inflation in '24, and that will be consistent with where we end up on pricing. From a daypart standpoint, I'd say pretty balanced there. But breakfast continues to be a competitive area, a lot of activity going on in breakfast. Our business, as you know, is dominated around particularly lunch. That's our single biggest daypart and that daypart continues to do well. So nothing particularly noteworthy that I would say on dayparts, but Ian, maybe you have any other insights to share there."", 'Ian Frederick Borden', ""Yes. You, I think, covered all the bases, Chris, but maybe just a couple of builds. I mean, I think we did see overall pricing for the year just around 10%. But as Chris noted, in the fourth quarter, that level of pricing came down, obviously, in line with inflation and was in that high single-digit range. I mean, I think we're continuing to see pretty consistent flow through with pricing, which I think is really important because it goes back to what I've spoken about before with just the tools and capabilities that we've put in place to make sure that when we are taking pricing, we're doing that in the most effective way possible. Obviously, as we head into 2024, knowing inflation has come down a fair bit from its peak. I think, as I said earlier, I think our pricing we certainly expect will come down roughly in line with that as we work through the year. We certainly know consumers are more weary or weary of pricing, and we're going to continue to be consumer led in our pricing decisions as we kind of look forward to 2024 and knowing that the environment will continue to be competitive. We'll be thoughtful together with our franchisees, obviously, who make those decisions in their own restaurants as we look forward."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.', 'Dennis Geiger', ""Great. Chris, wanted to just follow up on some of the color you just gave on the U.S. consumer and then some of that lower-income consumer, I think, managing the check a little bit. Just curious if you could elaborate anything more there on the consumer in the U.S. And is that check management largely been consistent with what you've seen in recent quarters? Or are you seeing any of the incidents or intensity there, pick up some? And ultimately, what does that mean as you kind of think about promotions and the evolving value options that you talk about in the U.S. this year."", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', ""Sure. I think consistent with what we talked about on the prior call, where you see the pressure with the U.S. consumer is that low-income consumer. So call it $45,000 and under. That consumer is pressured. From an industry standpoint, we actually saw that cohort decrease in the most recent quarter, particularly I think as eating at home has become more affordable. There's been much less pricing that's been taken more recently on packaged food. So you're seeing that eating at home is becoming more affordable that I think is putting some pressure from a IEO standpoint on that low-income consumer. If you think about middle income, high income, we're not seeing any real change in behavior with those. We continue to gain share with those groups. But the battleground is certainly with that low-income consumer. And I think what you're going to see as you head into 2024 is probably more attention to what I would describe as affordability. So think about that as being absolute price point being probably more important for that consumer in a lower absolute price point to get them into the restaurants than maybe a value message, which is a 2 for $6 or something like that. Those probably are going to resonate a little bit less in '24, particularly we think in the front half with the consumer there may be something that's lower absolute price points. So that's -- we are set up well to be able to go after that. We have our D123 platform, as you know, and I think you're going to see probably some activity there in the U.S. at the local level to make sure we continue to provide good value for that low-income consumer."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.', 'Sara Harkavy Senatore', ""I wanted to ask about G&A and it came in actually just below the 2.2% of system-wide sales you guided to, which is true despite the fact that I suspect that the system-wide sales were lower than you might have expected in the fourth quarter, given the implications in the Middle East. And so I was just curious to what extent are you able to flex your G&A? I know you usually guide to percentage of system-wide sales, but trying to understand whether sort of internally you actually forecast more along the time -- along lines of dollar spend? And are you seeing any of the -- any improvements perhaps because of Accelerating the Arches? I'm curious to what extent you have flex there."", 'Ian Frederick Borden', ""Sara, it's Ian. Let me take that one. Well, look, I think you've heard me talk about this before. But the way we think about G&A is kind of in 2 broad buckets. I mean, firstly, we want to continue to work to run our business as efficiently as we can. We know we've got some opportunities in that area. It's why I talked about in our upfront remarks that we're going to continue to invest in the areas where we think we have strategic opportunities to drive greater efficiency. A lot of that work is going to be led by the Global Business Services organization that we stood up and is driving these transformation efforts in area like HR, finance, tech and getting after spend opportunities in areas like indirect sourcing. So part of what we're focused on is continuing to make those strategic investments so that we can continue to drive greater efficiency in how we operate, which if you go back to the principles of kind of accelerating the organization, which was really what that whole initiative was designed around was how do we get faster, how do we get more innovative and how do we get more efficient in how we're running the business. The second kind of broad area of G&A spend is obviously investing in the areas that we feel like we've got opportunity to drive growth and strong returns for the business. And part of running the business more efficiently is to make sure we have the resources available to invest behind the opportunities that we believe exist, and we continue to believe we've got significant opportunities. I think we've talked previously to the examples of kind of our tech platforms and digital capabilities where we continue to make significant investment. Those, I think, are really strong examples of the type of growth when you look at the growth mix that are coming from those investments and obviously continuing to drive strong returns for us, and we're going to continue obviously to invest behind those growth opportunity areas that we have. And so I think that's -- over time, as you kind of look forward, I do believe we'll continue to be able to gain leverage in G&A as a percentage of sales. But I think certainly in the short term, our focus is going to be in those areas that I highlighted."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.', 'Christopher Emilio Carril', 'So just on McOpCo margins, I believe you mentioned you expect them to be relatively in line this year versus 2023. So can you expand maybe on some of the puts and takes around this outlook? Maybe any detail on U.S. versus IOM, your cost inflation outlook? And maybe finally, if and where you see opportunity for company margin upside?', 'Ian Frederick Borden', ""Well, let me take that. Yes, you're right. I think as you said, in our opening comments, we talked about the fact that we think our '24 company-operated margin percent will be roughly in line with where we ended for 2023. I mean I think there are a few things that are going on, so I'll kind of talk about it, U.S. and then International. I mean I think in the U.S., if you look at kind of commodity inflation for '24, we think that will be in the low single-digit range. I think wage inflation probably in the mid- to higher single-digit range. Part of that is because of the impact of what we're going to have to work through in California, which I know you'll be aware of and the significant wage increases that come into effect there at the beginning of April. I think internationally, on the commodity side, again, I think we expect commodity inflation to be in that low single-digit range. Wage inflation probably in the low to mid-single-digit range. So obviously, we've still got kind of the current inflationary effects. And at the same time, we've got, obviously, carryover from much higher kind of inflation levels that we experienced as we work through 2023. So those are a bit of maybe kind of the -- kind of pressures. Obviously, you've heard us talk about what we think from a sales perspective. So obviously, we're going to get a lift as we continue to grow sales through 2024 landing kind of where I said. But I think we remain really confident that we can continue to drive leverage in margins as we look forward as some of these inflationary pressures begin to settle on a more consistent basis. And we're able to continue to grow sales, which we're obviously really, really confident in our ability to do that with the plans and strategies that we've got in place."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'We have time for one more question from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.', 'Lauren Danielle Silberman', ""Just a follow-up. Given the modest pricing in '24 in the U.S., do you expect positive traffic then? And then my actual question is on the digital side. Can you talk about any changes as it relates to your approach, specifically to value offers as you look ahead into '24 in the U.S.? Have a lot of promotions on the app also driving higher ticket, frequency. So just -- to what extent is digital marketing accretive to franchisees? And just any thoughts there."", 'Christopher J. Kempczinski', ""Sure. Well, as you know, we don't give traffic guidance. So we won't get into kind of a specific what do we expect to see in traffic. But I think it's fair to say that the success in this industry is always about having balance and you need to have both traffic growth and you need to have price growth. That's the long-term formula for success. So that's kind of what we use as our North Star. I think we're set up really well to have that kind of balance. As I look at our business around the world, our brand is in great shape. We are seeing some of our highest customer satisfaction scores around the world. We're seeing our operations in almost every single country around the world get better as we execute our Performance and Customer Excellence program or PACE, as you know it. I think globally, in Q4, we saw service times improve by 10 seconds. And we've got very good alignment with our franchisees. In most of our big markets, we're seeing healthy franchising cash flows. In the U.S., franchising cash flows were up roughly $35,000 last year despite all the price headwinds. So I think we're set up well as a business to have that balance right as part of our long-term focus."", 'Mike Cieplak', 'Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Ian, and thanks, everyone, for joining.

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool analyst Jason Moser. Jason, how was your weekend?"", 'Jason Moser: Hey, Deidre. Just great, how about yours?', 'Deidre Woollard: Watched a lot of football.', ""Jason Moser: Yeah, there was a little bit on TV, wasn't there?"", ""Deidre Woollard: Just a little bit. Well a lot of times I meet with you on Mondays, we're talking about Big M and A deal today we are going the other way we've got a big break up may be a small break up depending on your view of it. But Amazon has called off its acquisition of iRobot, so Amazon doesn't seem to want a Roomba anymore. Why do you think that is?"", ""Jason Moser: No, it's un-deal. Un-deal."", 'Deidre Woollard: Yes un-deal I like that.', ""Jason Moser: Honestly, I'm not surprised it felt like this was something that was almost inevitable given the EU's concerns regarding the deal. I don't know, to me this was a deal that always it just never seemed to make sense. I understand Amazon is just trying to get more and more of data and I think the data argument works to an extent. But, as we've talked about before, data is data at some point it's becoming just unlimited. It's frankly it's very easy to get so then it becomes a matter of like what you do with the data. It's not really a matter of having the data as much as what you can do with it and I think it's fair to say that Amazon does a pretty good job of doing stuff with data. But what they would get from a company like this never really was clear from the start. To me I feel like, listen, I respect they realize there's no path to this still happening. It's going to be more trouble than it's worth. They pay what, a $94 million breakup fee, that's a little bit more than a 10th of a percent of the cash on Amazon's balance sheet. It impacts really nobody on the Amazon's side and so from that perspective, I'm not worked up at all about this deal on happening and frankly. I feel like I'm a little bit more happy that it's not happening because it just never really made sense to begin with."", ""Deidre Woollard: Maybe it was a tech play a little bit, there was that fear about the data. If it's important enough that the European regulators were trying to block it, I don't know what that maybe says about the relationship that companies are having with regulators. We're seeing this all over the place sometimes deals are taking extra long to go through. We know the FDC is looking at companies like Amazon, like Microsoft. It's got its eyes on big tech."", 'Jason Moser: Yeah.', ""Deidre Woollard: Do you think that's part of this for Amazon? It just thought, this is a tiny thing it's not even worth being a blip on the radar at this point with it."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, no question. There's no doubt that giving these things another look is very much involved these days, particularly when it involves big tech. When you look at the numbers its just compare that to the scope of Amazon's business. This is a deal it does not impact Amazon at least. You could look 10, 20 years out and say maybe what could they do with this deal on that data that might come from a deal like that. That is obviously you're speculating very far out and so from that perspective again, to me it just feels like they realize the juice isn't worth a squeeze. This isn't that big of a deal. It's just not worth getting into and I understand the EU regulators, there's a little bit more of a concern over antitrust regulations overseas versus here. But it does feel like over here, domestically speaking, that is becoming more and more of an issue. We're seeing more and more big tech, these types of deals are being put under the microscope and understandably so, it doesn't seem like these are deals that matter as much to the acquirers. For Amazon this just isn't really a big deal, for iRobot obviously it was a very big deal and this was a bit of an exit strategy and perhaps this was something that they were thinking from the moment they went public. Maybe this was part of the exit strategy plan there. I don't know it puts iRobot in a very difficult spot right now whereas with Amazon, just no worries at all. They're going to be able to keep on just going around business as usual so we'll have to see what comes up in regard to iRobot."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, that's the part that's worrisome. This deal has been in the work since August 2022 and when that announcement gets made, it's not that the company goes full stop, but there's always that pause. You don't quite have to push as hard, you know that this thing is coming and then all of a sudden it isn't. They announced they're laying off about a third of their staff. Amazon had already dropped the price on the acquisition, so it already signaled the value here is slipping. The Roomba brand, I was talking to you before the show and you mentioned that you bought a Roomba competitor recently."", 'Jason Moser: Good idea.', 'Deidre Woollard: Does that brand still have value?', ""Jason Moser: Well, there is value there. But I think that what we've seen is very quickly, what was it bit there's that old Warren Buffett quote regarding like the innovators, the imitators and the idiots. You have the innovators that come in there and get things going and then you have companies that come in there and try to imitate and they take part in that growth and then you have idiots that really come in there and don't know what they're doing. We're at this stage, it feels like in this particular market, I'm not talking about just robot vacuum cleaners, but all of these things that iRobot was focused on, we've seen a lot of imitators come in and these imitators have done a very good job. Just anecdotally, I went through and did a lot of research over the holiday season on one of these particular products. The robot vacuum cleaner that goes back to its station and unloads itself. I was just surprised, not really surprised, but I was just a little bit, I took note of the fact that the products that iRobot has, they just weren't getting the greatest reviews. Having had an iRobot, a Roomba from early on when these products really first launched, it was always one of those things where you thought there's potential, but it's not something that's necessary and it's not something that's sufficient. In other words, it doesn't take care of my problem. It's neat to have, but I don't need it and I think we're probably starting to move a little bit past that point where they start to become sufficient. They're not necessary by any means, but there's clearly a lot of competition out there and it does appear that iRobot and their products are playing second fiddle, if not further down the line and that's a big problem. If you're talking about making, a one to $2 billion acquisition of a company. You got to keep that stuff in mind, like is that brand on the up and up or is it something that is, witnessing some competitive pressures there and it certainly feels like iRobot was witnessing a lot of competitive pressures."", 'Deidre Woollard: Yeah, it has the name, but the name alone is not a mode at all.', ""Jason Moser: Yeah, it's not a verb yet."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, it's sort of but it didn't quite get to that status. The other thing I think here that I think a lot about is the promise of the Internet of Things and there's been that trend, the promise of the Internet. Everything's going to talk to each other. Your computer, your refrigerator, and everybody needs to be connected. This is the way of the future. That promise hasn't fully come through, in my opinion. I think that's part of this too, is that we're becoming less entranced with these types of items."", ""Jason Moser: I fully agree, I feel like there's a lot of potential when you consider the Internet of Things, particularly as it relates to consumers. But the promises have not really been fulfilled and I think a lot of that honestly just has to come down to the reliability and having used some of these things I've tried to incorporate certain types of these things into our lives at home. Amazon, Alexa, connecting it to the light switch, being able to just talk and make something happen. It's clever technology, it's really cool and when it works, it's really impressive. The problem is, it's not reliable. You know what's undefeated? Deidre The light switch. The light [laughs] switch is undefeated. When [laughs] I want the lights to come on, I flip the switch and they're on. But it took probably, I don't know, two or three times where I said, hey, Alexa, turn on the lights and she said, can't connect, don't know. I was like, OK, I'm out. It's not reliable. We need to get to that point where this stuff is just reliable and maybe there's a redundancy factor that comes into play here, with Cloud providers, they kind of have that back up to provide that redundancy. If we can get to that point with the Internet of Things and smart home where there's that redundancy and that reliability, then I think we're really onto something. We're just not there yet and it's not to say we won't get there, we're just not there yet."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, I think that's true. I want to move on and talk a little bit about earnings. The big earnings are coming later this week. But the one that we had today was SoFi. SoFi is interesting, this company started off as a SPAC. You have the former CFO of Twitter at the helm, Anthony Noto. But what's interesting is just how fast it's grown. The customer base grew 44% year over year. Now that's only 7.5 million customers total. It's not coming for Bank of America's throwing anytime soon, but this is interesting. Should we be taking SoFi a little more seriously?"", ""Jason Moser: I think so, personally. There are two things I really like about SoFi today. One is, you mentioned Anthony Noto. I think he's the right leader for this company at this stage of his life. He's a great advocate for the brand and I think he's done a wonderful job bringing the business where it is today. But I also think just SoFi was born from student loans. Ultimately it started as a student loan solution. That resonates with a demographic that I think is key to the company's success, and so when we see them getting seven-plus million members, clearly much of that member base skews younger. As we know banking is very sticky. I think this makes a lot of sense for companies like SoFi, you get companies out there like public.com. Any companies that are out there really trying to offer a new way of looking at finance and helping the younger generations approach these issues. There's a lot of potential there because banking can be so sticky. once you get your banking relationship involved, it's just a lot of work really, to unwind it. The longer that relationship pursues, the less inclined you are to really want to unwind it. I told you before like, if you look at me, for example, now I'm an old codger, but $10 of marketing spent toward me on SoFi's part, that's $10 wasted. I'm not going to switch because our banking relationships have been so established for so long, I don't want to unwind that. But for younger generations that don't have to worry about unwinding it, they're just getting started."", ""They're looking at these solutions that SoFi is presenting, and they're thinking this looks like something I could use. This looks like something that's going to be helpful for me. You know we saw in the press release they're offering opportunities in regard to investing in alternative funds. Whether you're a big believer in the alternative funds side thing or not, that's one thing. But then you look at they took that next step in actually offering the educational side of it too as well. For us here at the fool obviously that's a big part of what we do every day. We are big believers in the education side of things, and so I think there are a lot of reasons to believe that SoFi is on the right path here. It's just it's a difficult business, no question, but really it's very understandable. It's a big land grab. They're trying to get those members in and lock them in by giving them more services and making those services a bit more a part of their day to day lives."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, even just the word members that they used to describe their customers I think is interesting. Because part of what they're doing is they're giving it that, I hate to call it like a millennial feel, but there is that like you're part of this club of SoFi and you have this trust with us. We're going to just keep adding products that you might be interested in and we're going to do all of these different things for you. I think when you have that stickiness you can do that pretty quickly. I think it's easier to do with a smaller user base. I think it's going to get a little bit trickier. They're nimble in a way that a big bank can't be. But at some point they have to start playing more with the big boys."", ""Jason Moser: Well, you're right. At some point they'll have to approach that. But I absolutely agree with you on the members side of things. Reminds me very much of what American Express has done through the years. There's just something there, they create that sense of you're part of something a little bit bigger. You're part of something that is, I don't want to say exclusive, but there's something special to it. When you can make people feel good about something in which they are participating well, that typically is going to result in a longer term relationship."", ""Deidre Woollard: I think that's really the case, is that they're building this thing for the future versus just part of it's the land grab and part of it is like we're offering high interest savings and things like that, but it's really building this thing for the long term that matters. Jason, I want to ask you one more question. We talked a little bit briefly about the alternative investing thing that they announced today. Do you feel like the younger generation is interested in this? The sexy part of it of course is you can be part of Kathy Wood is Ark Investment. But the other part of it that's in with that is 6,000 mutual funds. Well, a [laughs] little less attractive. How do you think that's going to land with maybe a younger member base?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, that's a good point. I think that's really where the education part comes in. I think most of us would agree that mutual funds are yesterday's investments, not terribly focused on mutual funds as they're not the most efficient. Most of them tend to underperform the market. We typically don't point people toward mutual funds for the most part. But generally speaking, the alternative investments, I like the idea that they're bringing more options out there for people because ultimately their goal is to bring more people under their umbrella. That's where I think really the education part comes in. I'm happy to see that they built that part of the site out to help educate investors, to at least give them some better understanding as to what they may or may not be getting into. Again, younger generation, they don't know as much just because they haven't been around as long. That'll change quickly, of course. It's nice to see SoFi really focusing on that educational side of things."", 'Deidre Woollard: Absolutely. Well, thanks for breaking it down with me today, Jason.', 'Jason Moser: Thank you.', ""Deidre Woollard: We talk about a lot of stocks on the show, but it's just a peek at the motley fools investing universe.

I talked to Eric Siegel, author of the AI playbook, about the lessons we can learn from big companies pursuing AI objectives. Well, I'm excited to talk about the book because it hit on some anxieties I think I'm having when I see so many companies needing to deploy AI. There's so much hype right now and I worry that a lot of that hype, it turns very quickly to disappointment if things just fail to launch. Tell us a little bit about some of the hurdles that companies encounter."", ""Eric Siegel: Well, there tends to be a big disconnect between the business and tech side. Data scientists make a predictive model that's meant to target fraud detection and marketing and credit, financial credit risk management, etc. Then it doesn't actually get deployed because the business stakeholders just aren't quite ready the get wet feet. They weren't involved enough in the project. Taking a step back there is a lot of hype right now. Generative AI products like ChatGPT that generate text in an almost seemingly human like manner are extremely impressive. Something I never thought I'd see in my lifetime. I've been in the field for more than 30 years, but the value of them is probably overblown. There's a lot of value for having it write first drafts of English, of natural language, and of code, but I'd like to sort, pivot the listeners. Let's not forget the established enterprise use cases of the underlying technology which is machine learning. Learning from data to predict, which is used to improve all the large scale operations. The Holy Grail for improving operational decisions is prediction, whether you're going to click by lie or die, the outcome or behavior that will directly inform whether to contact you for marketing, which add to display, whether to issue a credit card, whether to audit you for fraud. This is where the established track record is. This is older than generative, let's call it predictive. But it's not old school, it's where the vast majority of established opportunities still exist. Its potential has only barely begun to be tapped. There's a lot of industry leaders, but there's far more that are behind and aren't quite making that connection between BizInTech, so there's a lot of initiatives that actually fail to deploy, and what's needed is a couple of things, an established industry process or practice, and that's what I talk about in the book. But perhaps more importantly, and first and foremost, is some ramping up. That's what I'd like to espouse. There's nothing intimidating about the basic idea of learning from data to predict and then using those predictions. What all business stakeholders need to learn about the use case, about any particular project that's meant to deliver value is three things, what's predicted, how well, and what's done about it. You might predict who's going to click by lie or die, commit an act of fraud, turn out to be a bad credit risk, etc, whatever behavior and outcome there would be to predict. Then what's done about it is, let's act on that in order to drive individual decisions. How well is, what are the metrics? How well does it predict? What kind of ROI would the project potentially deliver?"", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I like that you made that distinction between the generative AI that we're currently experiencing and playing with and the machine learning that has been existing in our lives for years. Some of the challenges with machine learning are there's the tech side and the deployment side, but there's a mindset issue there as well. How do you help businesses wrap their brain around that?"", ""Eric Siegel: Well, the mindset is basically something we've been talking about since the big data movement and well before that, which is, you need to be data driven, you need to be empirical. There's a place where computers trump the gut. I trust my GPS to tell me exactly where to drive. Every time I try to outguess it and think I know the residential streets better, I often get the sense that I was wrong and it knew where the traffic was and it optimizes. There are certain things machines are just better at, including learning from a large number of historical examples to predict, and prediction is the Holy Grail. This is what it means to apply science to the improvement of business, to be a specific, the improvement of our large-scale business operations, all the main things we do as organizations. The trust thing is moving along. But part of what's going to make a big difference with the trust, and also ultimately the antidote to hype is to focus on concrete use cases and get the stakeholders, for example, people who are in charge of the large-scale operations consisting of many decisions, that stand to potentially be improved by the predictions delivered by machine learning, because that's what it does, it learns from data to predict, and by getting everybody on the same page, and ramping up in detail on what's predicted, how well, what's done about it. This is driver's ed, not auto-mechanics school. You don't have to pop the car and see where those park plugs are to drive a car, but you need a lot of expertise about how cars operate and the rules of the road. Likewise, you need this expertise to run machine learning projects, and in that way, take the best practices in applying science to business and get the thing successfully through to deployment."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, all of these driving and auto-metaphors are leading me perfectly to your example of UPS in the book, which makes perfect sense. You've got 16 million deliveries a day using machine learning to optimize. Sure, that makes a lot of sense. But it was not that simple at all. Tell us about the story of Jack Levis and how he got machine learning into UPS and some of the challenges he faced."", ""Eric Siegel: An incredible story. Jack Levis was the lead, he's more recently retired, but he completely revolutionized the way they actually optimize that delivery of the 16 million packages, and the way they do it is they optimize delivery by predicting delivery. In particular, what they optimize is exactly the allocation of packages to delivery trucks at all the different shipping centers around the US. The end result of doing this, by the way, in conjunction with also prescribing driving routes, which I just mentioned a moment ago, which also helped, together this produces an annual savings for UPS of 185 million miles of driving a year, $350 million, eight million gallons of fuel, 185,000 metric tons of emissions. But the only way to make that improvement was not just the number crunching, it was the deployment, it was the actual integration of the predictions of what's learned from data to actually change existing operations. Today, we're so fascinated with the core technology. As a data scientist, I've been in the field more than 30 years. I was, and in some ways still am the same as your typical data scientist, we love that idea, it's the best of science, learn from data to predict. It's amazing, you're making discoveries that hold in general, in that sense you've actually learned a truth from historical data, and in that way, data is experience."", ""But what matters is actually getting it to deployment. It's like right now we're more excited about the rocket science than the launch of the rocket. Jack Levis very much faced that, and had to go up the organizational chain and then down. I cover that in a couple stories in the book, pretty much the opening of the book and then the closing, I circle back to the UPS story. Because first he had to convince an executive, and he literally took him for a ride and showed them what happens and how it's counter-intuitive and potentially more valuable. Then he had to convince the people actually implementing integrating the new process change, namely the staff workers who are loading the packages following the prescribed instructions on the loading dock, loading them into the trucks. They were resistant to change. Change is a hard thing, but if you're going to get an improvement, you need to implement change. That's why these projects need to be seen as business operation and improvement projects that involve change management rather than just being tech projects. The tech is important, the analytics are extremely important, that's what we're leveraging, but first and foremost, it's a business project."", ""Deidre Woollard: In the book, you also talk about the FICO score, you call it the most famous deployed model. It's amazing. It receives 20 billion records, which is just like terabytes of raw data every month, a petabyte every five years, so it's got all of this data coming in. How did they wrangle all of that?"", 'Eric Siegel: Well, actually, those stats that you just listed pertain to FICO\'s fraud detection model, which stands in contrast with the FICO\'s score. There are two different products that FICO has, and that\'s the funny thing, is that, FICO is so famous for the credit score, but probably a bigger part of their business, and something that affects you and I much more frequently is the fraud detection model. Doing what I just mentioned, in real time, banks are using it to decide whether to authorize your payment card transaction. In fact, FICO had very much as the corner on that market. For two-thirds of the world\'s payment cards, 90% in the US and the UK, every single transaction is determined on the fly, in real time based on the prediction of that very model that\'s delivered by FICO, whether or not to authorize and allow that charge. The reason they\'ve got so much data to work with, is that, every single bank that\'s using it has to have also agreed to participate in this consortium of banks that all provide the data from which to learn which transactions did or didn\'t turn out to be fraudulent. Greatly informed, of course, by, when customers complain because they\'re like, ""Hey, I didn\'t buy that."" You see that. That\'s the source of learning. That\'s what\'s called the training data, the positive and negative experience from which to learn. Each one is basically just a row of data. They accumulate this incredible amount of data, they literally provide an updated model exactly once a year to all the banks that are using it. That means even small and medium banks get to make use of the best in class fraud detection model, which is great. I mean, it\'s great for society. This is the very integrity of transactions. We need to make sure criminals aren\'t conducting unauthorized transactions too often. Yet we can\'t have too many safeguards because that\'ll really decrease the usability of e-commerce and in person bricks-and-mortar commerce as well. It\'s an amazing showcase of deployed machine learning.', ""Deidre Woollard: Also one of the things that you talk about in talking about that is how much prep has to go into making this model work. I think about it like painting a room. I mean, it's like no one wants to do the hard part of taping down everything, but really that's what you have to do with a large language model. Is, there's so much training. I feel like you've studied this thing, like you said, for 30 years. All of us are just learning right now about large language models. What do we need to know?"", ""Eric Siegel: Well, when we go to large language models, Generative AI, by the way, refers to all these large language models that power chat bots like ChatGPT and many other competitors as well as generating image, video, sound, music, so like DALL-E 2. Either way, you're leveraging the same core technology that I've been talking about for these enterprise projects. It's learning from data to predict. It's just that you're applying that technology in a very different way. It's literally predicting what should the next word be as I'm writing this sentence or this paragraph. Well, technically, it's the next token, but it's basically on that level of detail per word. In the case of rendering an image, it's how should I change this one pixel as I'm continually iteratively going through phases to iterate this incredible image. The capacity for it to generate these images and generate text and computer code is just unbelievable."", ""I mean, before I was a professor at Columbia, I got my PhD there, during which for six years, I was in the Natural Language Processing Research Group. I've seen it fail a lot, and seeing what it can do now is definitely something I never thought I'd see during my lifetime. I mean, they really ramped up the underlying core technology in order to actually leverage this unfathomable amount of data points from which to learn. But just the same as you learn, hey, transactions with these characteristics done by this type of cardholder, this situation, and this time of day, and all the attributes that might inform the chances that it's fraudulent, just the same as that. It's saying, hey, look, I've written these three-and-a-half sentences so far, given that I should predict what's the next most likely word. It's the same idea, same core technology, just being applied in a different way. The question is, how far can we get? What it's done is extremely impressive and definitely valuable in terms of first drafts that are then used by a human. Measuring the absolute enterprise business value of that endeavor, well, that's something people haven't been talking about enough."", ""There's been some initiatives to that end. Of course, the value is going to totally depend on the particular writing, let's say, you have to write 200 letters a day to customer service or something. It depends on the particular language model you're using. It's experimental. You can only try it out and see how well it works. But the overarching question is, how far is it going to get in terms of helping and even replicating what humans can do? I say, well look, how much can we actually reverse engineer, the incredible abilities of the human mind, just based on that one part language? That one behavior of humans recorded as all the words that we've written. Well, you can get pretty far, but you're not going to get all the way as far as the general capabilities of humans. I think that's a red herring when we talk about what they call artificial general intelligence; computers that can do anything people can do. But as far as improving writing tasks, coding tasks, drawing tasks, there's a whole new level of capabilities, and there's a lot of creativity coming down the line in terms of the way it could be used. But as far as everyone's waiting for the big value to strike oil, to discover that killer app, people who code say, hey, that is a code killer app, for me, it's really helping me. It makes me code 50% faster, maybe twice as fast but depending on the task in maybe the best case. In a sense, that's a killer app. But I think in terms of the public narrative on the world stage, there's no killer app. It's like waiting for it do. The killer app that's implied in the story is an artificial person, and I do not think we're headed there."", ""Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have core recommendations for or against, sod don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

Investors were probably excited about the guidance that was given."", 'This momentum is part of the reason why shares are up 71% in the last three years (as of Feb. 2). This gain far outpaces the 30% rise of the S&P 500.', ""Can the good times keep rolling for this top financial stock? Find out what the bulls and bears say about AmEx before figuring out if it's a smart buying opportunity today."", ""Going back to American Express's latest results, the business reported revenue (net of interest expense) and diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% and 27%, respectively, in Q4 on a year-over-year basis. This is a company that continues to post solid gains regardless of the macroeconomic environment."", ""In 2023, AmEx added 12.2 million net new card members, just slightly fewer than it did last year. During the last quarter, 32% of the company's U.S. payment volume was from the millennial and Gen Z demographics, showcasing how the business is successful at attracting younger customers who could be lifelong members. This group is also registering the fastest growth in spending."", 'Management provided an upbeat outlook. They expect revenue to rise between 9% and 11% this year, with diluted EPS slated to jump 13% to 17%.', ""The sign of a marvelous business is the presence of an economic moat. Thanks to its powerful network effects, AmEx's competitive position faces minimal threats of disruption. The company operates a closed-loop system, which means it not only issues cards to customers, it also operates the communications channel that merchants use to accept payments. As more card holders come on, the network becomes increasingly valuable to merchants, and vice versa. This positive feedback loop is what makes the business special."", 'American Express also stands out from the crowd because of its ability to target higher-income customers who are generally a lower credit risk for the company. Instead of trying to mainly earn interest income on card balances, AmEx focuses on a spend-centric model. This means most of its revenue comes from people using their cards, and from annual fees.', ""Having more affluent card members has resulted in much lower default rates for AmEx. In Q4, it reported a net charge-off rate of 2%. To be fair, this has ticked higher in the last few quarters, but it's still below pre-pandemic levels -- and it's much lower than other major credit card issuers'."", ""To gain a more holistic view, investors also need to understand some reasons why AmEx might not be a good business. It's always smart to know both sides of the story."", ""For starters, we can't ignore the competitive landscape. I discussed above how AmEx's network effects protect it in a cutthroat industry. But this is still something that should be on your radar."", 'When it comes to attracting new card members, American Express faces intense competition from the likes of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Capital One, to name just three companies. All offer card products with top-notch rewards and perks, which can diminish the high-end status that AmEx tries to exude.', ""American Express might target wealthier clients, but it's still fully exposed to the macroeconomic environment. Changes in interest rates and inflationary pressures have a profound effect on consumer behavior and spending patterns. If a severe recession happens, the business could see its charge-offs shoot up. Consequently, there is some cyclicality here."", 'Taking all the above factors into account, I think the bullish arguments are far more compelling than the bearish. This makes AmEx a fantastic stock to buy right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?', 'Before you buy stock in American Express, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and American Express wasn’t one of them.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Ulta Beauty, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.43 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$5.6b - US$1.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""Thus, Ulta Beauty has an ROCE of 43%.

So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Ulta Beauty thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital."", ""To sum it up, Ulta Beauty has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And with a respectable 70% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist."", 'If you want to continue researching Ulta Beauty, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.', ""If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We've delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2023, established a strong foundation for continued growth, and started off 2024 with tremendous momentum with additional approvals for CASGEVY, positive Phase 3 results for VX-548 in acute pain last week, and positive results for the vanzacaftor triple program in CF, this afternoon. In 2023, Vertex continued to reach more CF patients and achieved full year CF product revenues of $9.87 billion, representing 11% growth versus 2022. Following the historic approvals of CASGEVY, the first-ever CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy, our launch is off and running globally as we are now approved in both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia in the U.S., Great Britain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain."", ""CASGEVY is a one-time precise durable CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is generating strong enthusiasm from physicians and patients and excellent support from payers. We're also working toward multiple additional near term commercial opportunities driving toward our five launches in five years goal. The recent approvals for CASGEVY in both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia deliver the first two. Now with the positive Phase 3 results from VX-548 in acute pain and for the vanzacaftor triple therapy in CF, these are potentially the next two, and with a strong clinical-stage pipeline with first-in-class or best-in-class assets, we are well on our way to our goal of five launches by 2028. In addition to the rapidly advancing clinical-stage pipeline, the next wave of innovation also continues to make progress, and as we announced last month, we are pleased to be advancing two new disease areas into the clinic."", 'First, myotonic dystrophy type 1 or DM1, a serious disease with high unmet need and no approved therapies. This disease affects approximately 110,000 patients in North America and Europe. Our DM1 program represents our nineth disease area to advance into the clinic. We already initiated a Phase 1/2 study in patients that is to state a study that will be able to assess both safety and efficacy late last year. And second, we expect to advance into our 10th disease area in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease or ADPKD, the most common genetic kidney disease that affects approximately 250,000 patients in the U.S. and EU alone, into the clinic with a healthy volunteer study in the first half of this year. With that overview, let me now turn to a more detailed pipeline review.', 'This quarter, I will limit my comments to the programs with significant recent updates, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and pain, so as to leave time for your questions. Starting with cystic fibrosis and our next-in-class vanzacaftor triple combination therapy. This afternoon we reported positive results from the Phase 3 program, including the SKYLINE 102 and 103 studies in patients 12 years and above, and the RIDGELINE study in patients ages six to 11. We are very pleased with these results and the arc of progress in treating patients with CF, as we continue to advance our ultimate goal of bringing all eligible patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. Treatment with the vanza triple met all primary and secondary endpoints in the three Phase 3 studies, and once again, our proprietary HBE assays were both qualitatively and quantitatively predictive.', 'In the SKYLINE 102 and 103 trials, the vanzacaftor triple combination met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority versus TRIKAFTA on ppFEV1, consistent with our expectations. The difference in ppFEV1 in the TRI and vanza-treated groups was negligible. In SKYLINE 102, the LS mean difference was 0.2, numerically favoring vanza, and meeting non-inferiority with a p-value of less than 0.0001. And in the SKYLINE 103 study, again, the difference in ppFEV1 in the TRI and vanza-treated groups was negligible, and numerically favored vanzacaftor with LS mean difference of 0.2, meeting non-inferiority with a p-value of less than 0.0001. Recall, the improvement in ppFEV1 in treatment-naive patients in the original TRI Phase 3 program was approximately 14%.', 'In addition, all key secondary endpoints were met across SKYLINE 102 and 103, and showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in sweat chloride. The sweat chloride results were measured in three key secondary endpoints. First, the overall achieved sweat chloride levels in the two RCTs were lower in the vanza-treated group versus the TRIKAFTA-treated group. The LS mean difference was minus 8.4 with a p-value of less than 0.0001 in SKYLINE 102. The LS mean difference was minus 2.8 with a p-value of 0.0034 in SKYLINE 103. The key difference of course in SKYLINE 102 and 103 was the genotype studied. SKYLINE 102 included [FMF] (ph) patients, who have more severe disease and therefore higher sweat chloride levels at baseline and SKYLINE 103 included FF and other responsive mutations with lower baseline sweat chloride levels.', 'Next, the second key secondary endpoint of proportion of sweat chloride less than 60 mmol pooled across two studies, 86% of patients in the vanza-treated groups and 77% of patients in the TRIKAFTA-treated groups achieved sweat chloride levels below 60 mmol, leading to an odds ratio of 2.21 and a p-value of 0.0001. This means about two times greater likelihood in the odds of achieving sweat chloride less than 60 with vanza versus TRIKAFTA. Last, the third key secondary endpoint of proportion of sweat chloride less than 30 mmol pooled across the two studies, 31% of patients in the vanza-treated groups versus 23% of patients in the TRIKAFTA-treated groups achieved sweat chloride levels below 30 mmol, leading to an odds ratio of 2.87 and a p-value of 0.0001.', 'This means about three times greater likelihood in the odds of achieving sweat chloride less than 30 with vanzacaftor versus TRIKAFTA. The results were even more pronounced in the RIDGELINE study evaluating children ages six to 11. The primary endpoint in the single-arm study was safety, which I will come to in a minute. On efficacy, 95% of patients achieved sweat chloride below 60 mmol, the diagnostic threshold for cystic fibrosis, and more than half reached sweat chloride levels below the carrier level threshold of 30 mmol. These sweat chloride results with the vanza triple are both impressive and important. Let me take a step back to frame the significance of these results. While CF is a systemic multi-organ disease, historically, the focus has been primarily on lung function as measured by ppFEV1, given it is the most visible symptom and typically the cause of death in CF patients.', ""ppFEV1 is also the regulatory enabling endpoint. Given the strides we've made with TRIKAFTA, we believe we may have reached the maximum potential benefit in lung function from CFTR modulators, thus, our objective was vanzacaftor moves beyond the focus on lung function to a broader, more ambitious goal to improve CFTR protein function as measured by lower sweat chloride levels and deliver even greater systemic benefit than TRIKAFTA. To be clear, the goal with the vanza pivotal development program was to show that lung function benefit was non-inferior to TRIKAFTA and over and above that to deliver additional benefit on sweat chloride, the direct marker of CFTR protein function. A note on CFTR protein. CFTR protein dysfunction is the underlying pathophysiology in CF, and while CF is often diagnosed by a genetic test at birth, it is confirmed via a sweat chloride test, because it is the direct measure of CFTR protein dysfunction."", ""Simply put, higher levels of sweat chloride associated with more severe disease. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to restore CFTR protein function as measured by sweat chloride, back to normal or as close to normal as possible so that there is no manifestation of disease. And more specifically, sweat chloride values below 60 mmols are associated with improved outcomes, such as better and more stable lung function, fewer pulmonary exacerbations, better quality of life, and improved survival. Vertex's ultimate treatment goal is to restore sweat chloride levels to below 30, which is considered normal and are typical of CF carriers who do not have the disease, for instance, the parents of children with CF. Thus, our goal in designing the vanzacaftor triple therapy studies was to test if even more patients treated with vanza could achieve those sweat chloride thresholds of less than 60 and less than 30 than those treated with TRIKAFTA."", 'Switching to safety, the vanza triple was generally safe and well-tolerated in all three studies. The adverse events seen in the vanza triple pivotal development program are consistent with the underlying disease and with the incidents and nature of adverse events we have seen with previous CFTR modulators. As a reminder and to round out the profile of the vanzacaftor triple, this therapy offers the convenience of once-daily dosing for patients and a substantially lower royalty burden. In summary, we set a goal to establish a new and higher bar in the treatment of CF with CFTR modulators, and with these Phase 3 vanza triple results, we have the first evidence that we have done so, and with these results, we now know that the vanza triple has indeed surpassed the very high bar set by TRIKAFTA in people with CF, ages six and older.', 'And by treating patients early with the vanza triple, we have the potential to possibly prevent systemic manifestations of CF in more people. These results also reaffirm our conviction that continued investment in scientific and serial innovation will allow us to complete our journey to transform CF by bringing all eligible CF patients down to carrier levels of sweat chloride, where there are no manifestations of disease. I want to acknowledge the CF patients in our clinical trials, who put their trust in us as well as the Vertex San Diego team and the CF R&D teams, some of whom have worked on CF for more than 20 years to deliver yet another potentially transformative medicine. We are working rapidly to compile the regulatory submissions and anticipate filing in both the U.S. and Europe for patients ages six and older by the middle of 2024.', ""We will be using one of our priority review vouchers entitling us to designate the vanza NDA for priority review, which provides an expedited six-month review versus a standard 10-month review timeline. I'll close on CF with VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna, for the more than 5,000 CF patients who do not make any CFTR protein and therefore cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Late last year, we completed enrollment in dosing in the single-ascending dose portion of our study for VX-522 and initiated the multiple-ascending dose portion of the study. This study continues to screen, enroll, and dose patients and we expect data late this year or early next. Turning now to CASGEVY, our precise durable CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that delivers a potential one-time functional cure for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia."", 'CASGEVY represents an enormous advancement for the estimated 35,000 people living with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia across the U.S. and Europe, as well as thousands of patients in other regions such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. CASGEVY represents a significant commercial opportunity as well, and Stuart will discuss the strong start to the launch following the rapid approvals in multiple countries. While these launches are underway, we are awaiting approval in the EU, where CASGEVY has received CHMP positive opinion for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. CASGEVY is also under review in Switzerland and we anticipate filing in Canada this quarter. Lastly on CASGEVY, recognizing the importance of treating patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia early in life to minimize organ damage and other complications of the disease, we are conducting studies in both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia to expand the label to younger age groups.', 'To that end, we recently completed enrollment in our two global Phase 3 studies in patients five to 11 years of age, and dosing in these studies is underway. Moving to the Pain program and VX-548, our novel highly selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor. With VX-548, we finally have the possibility of a medicine that has the compelling combination of both strong efficacy and strong safety that can be used for multiple moderate-to-severe pain types across multiple settings of care. Last week, we detailed the positive results from the three Phase 3 trials that comprise our pivotal program for VX-548 in acute pain, including randomized placebo-controlled trials in two different pain models, abdominoplasty, a soft-tissue pain model, and bunionectomy, a hard tissue pain model, and a single-arm safety and effectiveness trial in a broad range of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.', 'Both the abdominoplasty and bunionectomy RCTs met the primary endpoint with statistically significant improvement in pain compared to placebo on the primary endpoint of SPID48. The SPID48 is derived from a change in the numeric pain rating scale or NPRS. Practicing physicians tell us that in addition to SPID48 they focus on this reduction in the NPRS from baseline and this change in baseline in NPRS score is also how clinical meaningfulness is assessed in the field. In acute post-operative pain studies, clinical meaningfulness is defined by at least a two-point change in NPRS from baseline or at least a 30% reduction in NPRS from baseline. In that context, both RCTs demonstrated that treatment with VX-548 led to rapid, clinically meaningful reductions on the NPRS with more than three points of pain reduction or roughly a 50% reduction from baseline in the VX-548 arms.', 'The single-arm safety and effectiveness trial was conducted in a broad range of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions and supported longer-term safety and effectiveness. VX-548 was safe and well-tolerated across all three studies, including multiple acute pain types and settings. Of importance, with respect to safety in the two RCTs, the incidence of adverse events in the VX-548 arms was lower than placebo, an uncommon and noteworthy finding. We believe the results of this comprehensive Phase 3 program support a broad, moderate-to-severe acute pain label, and if approved, should enable prescribing and usage across multiple care settings. VX-548 has already secured Fast Track and Breakthrough designations and we are working with urgency to file the NDA by mid-2024.', 'Moving now to neuropathic pain. Two months ago, we also reported positive results from our Phase 2 study of VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, one type of peripheral neuropathic pain, and another area of high unmet need. We look forward to our end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA towards the end of this quarter and starting our Phase 3 program thereafter. We also continue to enrol and dose our second Phase 2 neuropathic pain study of VX-548 in lumbosacral radiculopathy or LSR. Ultimately, we seek a broad neuropathic pain label and believe by studying two of the largest pain segments, DPN and LSR, which together represent more than 60% of all peripheral neuropathic pain, we have a pathway to that broad indication. Just as we transform the treatment of CF, we believe we have the potential to transform the treatment of pain, both acute and neuropathic, based on the compelling and consistent results we have seen with VX-548.', ""We now have results in hand from the Phase 3 program in acute pain as well as the Phase 2 results in DPN. We are underway with the Phase 2 study in LSR and we are continuing to execute our portfolio approach of serial innovation. We are well on our way to helping address the unmet need of 90 million patients suffering with pain. With that, I'll now turn it over to Stuart."", 'Stuart Arbuckle: Thanks, Reshma. With the recent approvals of CASGEVY in sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia in multiple countries and the recent positive results in our pivotal trials for VX-548 in acute pain and for the vanzacaftor triple combination in CF, we are well and truly entering a new era of commercial diversification. As Reshma noted, we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year commercial results in CF. As we continue to grow the number of eligible patients receiving our CFTR modulators, fourth quarter U.S. growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA including in patients ages two to five-years-old, following the approval for these patients in April. Outside the U.S., we saw continued growth from both label expansions and new reimbursement agreements.', 'In the near term, we will continue to focus on reaching more eligible patients including younger age groups, which will provide revenue growth, and then we expect to drive further growth with the vanzacaftor triple combination. Given the positive Phase 3 data we released today that demonstrates a strong benefit-risk profile and the ability to deliver greater restoration of CFTR function than even TRIKAFTA, we believe the vanzacaftor triple combination will be widely welcomed by the CF community, both as a new treatment option for the greater than 6,000 patients who have discontinued one of our current CFTR modulators and as an opportunity for TRIKAFTA patients to achieve even greater levels of CFTR function. Longer term, we see additional growth from our mRNA program, VX-522, that we are developing in partnership with Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients with mutations that do not respond to CFTR modulators.', 'In addition, we recently updated our estimates of the number of people living with CF in North America, Europe, and Australia to 92,000 from the previous estimate of 88,000. This increase is in large part due to patients living longer as a result of improvements in CF care, including the advent of CFTR modulators. We expect this trend to continue based on the real-world evidence we have generated on the clinical benefits of CFTR modulators and this will also drive long-term growth. Now, turning to CASGEVY and launches in sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. Enthusiasm from patients, physicians, and payers is very high around the globe and we are focused on translating the scientific and medical innovation that CASGEVY represents into transformative patient benefit in the real-world.', 'In countries where CASGEVY has been approved, our sales, reimbursement, and access teams, as well as patient engagement teams have hit the ground running. Let me provide some insights on the early days of the launch. Starting with physicians. There is tremendous interest in CASGEVY and what it can do for their patients. And we see the impact of that in the rapid activation of authorized treatment centers. Less than two months post-approval, we already have 12 ATCs in the U.S., three in the EU, and one in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia already to receive patients. Reaction from payers has also been very positive. In the U.S., across commercial and government payers, all eligible CASGEVY patients have case-by-case coverage through single-case agreements.', ""We continue to see excellent progress from payers on the development of their formal medical policies and reimbursement pathways. We have a contract in place with Synergy for up to 100 million lives and are actively engaged with other commercial payers to finalize medical policies, which would bring the total percentage of covered lives to over 80%. In the government sector, Medicaid state agencies representing over 60% of sickle cell disease lives have established reimbursement pathways for CASGEVY, with an additional 25% of Medicaid sickle cell disease lives in states actively progressing their reimbursement methodologies. In addition, we're pleased to have received the January approval in the U.S. for CASGEVY for transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients, two and a half months early, and are working to achieve a similarly fast trajectory for gaining reimbursement and access for these patients."", ""Last week, there was an important update by the Biden administration on the CMMI Cell & Gene Therapy access demonstration model, that was originally announced in February of 2023, and was recently accelerated for implementation from 2026 to 2025. We believe the CMMI CGT access model could be an important additional path to access and we now have greater clarity on the scope and process to be employed in the model. The model is intended to provide a comprehensive strategy to address barriers to equitable access to cell and gene therapies for Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as the longstanding inequities of care in the sickle cell disease community. Last week's update also confirmed additional federal funding to support access and included a defined scope of manufacturer-provided fertility support in the model."", 'In recognition that for patients choosing to embark on the treatment journey, the cost of fertility preservation are a barrier to access. In the meantime, we continue to actively engage with state Medicaid agencies to finalize medical policies for CASGEVY, even in advance of the CGT access model to ensure patient access without delay. Outside the U.S., we are pleased that the French National Authority for Health has approved our request for the implementation of an early access program or EAP for TDT patients ages 12 years to 35 years. We are delighted to have secured a path to access and payment in France ahead of a national reimbursement agreement and are also in an EAP review process for sickle cell disease patients. In the U.K., CASGEVY will be reviewed by the Highly Specialized Technology Committee in February and we are advancing our reimbursement discussions in other European countries as well.', ""We also see strong progress in the Middle East, which is especially important for CASGEVY given the high prevalence of these diseases in the region and the government's clear focus on elevating the health of their citizens. We are working with local healthcare authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to refine our estimates of the exact number of eligible patients, but there are thousands of patients we could serve and we are focused on securing access and reimbursement for them. We have established a local presence in the region, have already activated our first ATC and are working with local healthcare professionals to expand the number of ATCs and establish the required infrastructure to meet patient demand. As we have previously outlined, the CASGEVY patient journey can be broken down into three key phases, each of which can take several months, pre-treatment, cell collection and manufacturing, and then infusion of the edited cells."", 'We are pleased with the early days of what will be a foundational year for CASGEVY, as we work to deliver transformative patient outcomes with the possibility of a lifetime of benefit. We look forward to updating you on the CASGEVY launch over the course of this year. To help track our progress, our expectation is to provide quarterly updates on the number of activated ATCs as well as the number of patients in the cell collection phase. ATCs have begun assessing their patients for the ability to be treated with CASGEVY and we expect that the first commercial patients will start the journey in the coming weeks. Shifting now to VX-548. We are very excited about the potential for this highly selective NaV1.8 inhibitor to provide a transformative treatment option for the millions of patients suffering from acute and peripheral neuropathic pain.', ""This quarter, I will limit my comments to acute pain. As we discussed last week when we share the results from the pivotal program, we are very excited about VX-548's compelling combination of efficacy and safety and the demonstration that it can be used for moderate-to-severe pain across a range of pain conditions, both surgical and non-surgical, and across a range of settings. If approved, VX-548 will be the first of a new class of medicines that inhibit the pain signal and represent the first new class of medicines for acute pain in over 20 years. The reason we're so excited about the potential for VX-548 to positively impact patient care is because we estimate approximately 80 million patients are prescribed a medicine for moderate-to-severe acute pain every year in the U.S., representing over one billion calendar days of treatment."", ""Given this massive patient population, acute pain is a multi-billion dollar market today despite the fact that essentially all prescriptions are generic. We also see upside to this market opportunity given the significant unmet need that stems from the suboptimal benefit-risk profiles of existing agents, such as the limited efficacy but acceptable side effects of NSAIDs or the adverse effects and addiction potential of opioids, all of which leads to suboptimal pain management. What physicians and patients seek is a medicine that combines effective relief of moderate-to-severe pain with a clear safety and tolerability profile, and VX-548 delivers on that profile. We've previously shared our go-to-market strategy and we are now actively recruiting our field force in anticipation of our regulatory filing and approval."", 'The commercial team will focus on the roughly 2,000 hospitals and institutions, where a majority of acute pain patients are seen and prescriptions are written. We continue to see a multi-billion dollar opportunity for VX-548 in acute pain alone. The well-known risks of opioids have led to widespread restrictions and limitations on their use over the years. Increasingly, we are seeing a paradigm shift in policy initiatives across various stakeholders to encourage consideration and use of non-opioid alternatives and to remove financial barriers to choosing a branded non-opioid. As an example, late last month, Congress introduced the Bipartisan Alternatives to Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act or the alternatives to pain Act. If enacted, Medicare Part D plans would be required to set co-pays for non-opioids like VX-548 in line with co-pays for generic opioids, which are typically between [$0] (ph) and $15.', 'The bill would also prohibit Medicare Part D plans from requiring seniors to step through opioids first or requiring prior authorization for non-opioids. In addition, the NOPAIN Act or Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act, which was enacted in late 2022, provides for an add-on payment for non-opioids in the outpatient and ambulatory surgery center settings, and remains on track to go into effect in 2025. And just recently, seven states, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have pending legislation that would require education on non-opioid options and would remove financial barriers to patient access within state-based health insurance programs like Medicaid. We expect additional states to introduce similar legislation later this year.', ""We believe that these advances in federal and state legislation represent further momentum in Congress and across the U.S. to encourage adoption of and remove any financial barriers to using non-opioid therapies like VX-548. In conclusion, it's an incredibly exciting time at Vertex. We continue to treat more CF patients around the world, and with the vanza triple, now have visibility to provide an option for the patients who have discontinued CFTR modulators as well as the possibility to bring even more patients below diagnostic levels and even to carrier levels of sweat chloride. We're entering a new era of commercial diversification with the launch of CASGEVY, the first-ever gene-edited therapy that brings a potential functional cure to patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia across multiple regions, and we are preparing for additional near-term launches with significant market potential, including VX-548 in acute pain."", ""I'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials."", ""Charlie Wagner: Thanks, Stuart. Vertex's excellent results in the fourth quarter of 2023 demonstrate once again our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. Fourth quarter 2023 revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $2.52 billion and was nicely balanced with revenue growth of 8% in the U.S. and 12% outside the U.S. Full year revenue of $9.87 billion represents 11% growth versus 2022, our nineth consecutive year of at least double-digit growth. Overall, the primary drivers of revenue growth in 2023 were in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses were $1 billion, compared to $872 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Included in Q4 '23 results are $18 million of acquired IPR&D charges, compared to $23 million of such charges in the fourth quarter of 2022."", 'Note, that with the approval of CASGEVY in the fourth quarter cost for manufacturing capacity for CASGEVY are now being recorded in cost of goods sold rather than in R&D. Full year 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses were $4.24 billion compared to $3.07 billion in 2022. Fourth quarter and full year operating expense growth was driven as expected by continued investment in research and our pipeline as we have now advanced assets into the clinic in nine different disease areas. In the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, the most significant areas of increased investment versus prior year included the pivotal studies for VX-548 in acute pain and the vanzacaftor triple in CF, the Phase 1/2 study for Type 1 diabetes as well as the build-out of capabilities for both our expanding pipeline and our anticipated near-term commercial launches.', 'In addition, approximately $400 million of the year-over-year increase in operating expenses was the result of increased AIPR&D costs from new business development. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $1.15 billion, consistent with $1.15 billion in non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $4.37 billion compared to $4.79 billion in 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 effective tax rate of 16.3% reflects an increase in our 2023 U.S. R&D tax credits. This benefit lowered the Q4 rate and brought the full year 2023 effective tax rate to 19.4%, slightly below our guidance range of 20% to 21%. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.20, representing 12% growth compared to $3.76 in the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'Full year 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share were $15.23 compared to $14.88 in 2022. We ended the quarter with $13.7 billion in cash and investments. Our priorities for cash deployment remain unchanged as we continue to prioritize investment in innovation including external innovation via business development. During 2023, we completed 10 transactions and recognized over $500 million of AIPR&D. We also deployed over $400 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares over the course of 2023. Now switching to guidance. For 2024, we expect total product revenue in a range of 10.55% to $10.75 billion, representing revenue growth of 8% at the midpoint at current exchange rates. Included in this outlook is our expectation for continued growth in CF as we continue to reach more patients including younger ones in core markets and select other countries.', 'Guidance also includes contribution from the commercial launch of CASGEVY in approved indications and geographies. We continue to expect a foundational year for CASGEVY in 2024, as we ramp up patient initiations and build toward a multi-billion dollar market opportunity overtime. We are providing total product revenue guidance rather than specifics by disease area or product given the inherent uncertainty of new launches as well as the significant disparity in size of our established CF business relative to other revenues. As a reminder, on the accounting for CASGEVY and the CRISPR profit share arrangement, Vertex will book 100% of revenues for CASGEVY. The profit share with CRISPR calculated after product and commercial costs will be recorded in cost of goods sold.', ""Any ongoing research and development costs will be recorded in operating expenses net of CRISPR's share. For total Vertex operating expenses, we project $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion in full year 2024 combined non-GAAP SG&A, R&D, and acquired IPR&D. This operating expense range includes approximately $125 million in currently anticipated IPR&D charges. We continue to invest a majority of our operating expenses into R&D given the momentum in our multiple mid and late-stage clinical development programs. Note, that the costs for multiple Phase 3 studies have been a significant driver of our growth in our total operating expenses in recent years. Given that a number of Phase 3 studies were completed as we entered 2024, we were able to fund new additional Phase 3 studies without the same rate of growth in operating expenses."", 'While we have substantially completed our commercial investments for CASGEVY, we are also funding the expansion of our commercial capabilities in anticipation of other multi-billion dollar opportunities represented by our programs with near-term launch potential, while continuing to leverage an attractive business model afforded by our focus in specialty markets. With a more normalized impact from U.S. R&D tax credits in 2024, our full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. In closing, Vertex delivered excellent results yet again in 2023, achieving strong revenue growth, important regulatory approvals and commercial launches, and positive pivotal trial results that will enable additional near-term launches.', ""We also made progress in our earlier-stage pipeline with proof-of-concept for VX-548 in neuropathic pain and anticipated advancement of two additional disease areas into the clinic. We also made substantial investments behind our programs and commercial capabilities for near-term launches. As we head into 2024, we anticipate further important milestones as highlighted on Slide 20 to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls, and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&A period."", ""Susie Lisa: Thanks, Charlie.

Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We've delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2023, established a strong foundation for continued growth and started off 2024 with tremendous momentum, with additional approvals for CASGEVY, positive Phase III results for VX-548 in acute pain last week and positive results for the vanzacaftor triple program in CF this afternoon.In 2023, Vertex continued to reach more CF patients and achieved full year CF product revenues of $9.87 billion, representing 11% growth versus 2022. Following the historic approvals of CASGEVY, the first-ever CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy, our launch is off and running globally as we are now approved in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in the U.S., Great Britain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.CASGEVY is a onetime precise, durable CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is generating strong enthusiasm from physicians and patients and excellent support from payers. We're also working toward multiple additional near-term commercial opportunities driving toward our 5 launches in 5 years ago.The recent approvals for CASGEVY in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia deliver the first 2. Now with the positive Phase III results from VX-548 in acute pain and from the vanzacaftor triple therapy in CF, these are potentially the next 2. And with a strong clinical stage pipeline with first-in-class or best-in-class assets, we are well on our way to our goal of 5 launches by 2028.In addition to the rapidly advancing clinical stage pipeline, the next wave of innovation also continues to make progress. And as we announced last month, we are pleased to be advancing 2 new disease areas into the clinic. First, myotonic dystrophy type 1 or DM1, a serious disease with high unmet need and no approved therapies.This disease affects approximately 110,000 patients in North America and Europe. Our DM1 program represents our ninth disease area to advance into the clinic. We already initiated a Phase I/II study in patients, that is to say a study that will be able to assess both safety and efficacy, late last year.And second, we expect to advance into our tenth disease area in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease or ADPKD, the most common genetic kidney disease that affects approximately 250,000 patients in the U.S. and EU alone, into the clinic, with a healthy volunteer study in the first half of this year.With that overview, let me now turn to a more deep pipeline review. This quarter, I'll limit my comments to the programs with significant recent updates: cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia and pain, so as to leave time for your questions.Starting with cystic fibrosis and our next-in-class vanzacaftor triple combination therapy. This afternoon, we reported positive results from the Phase III program, including the SKYLINE 102 and 103 studies in patients 12 years and above and the RIDGELINE study in patients ages 6 to 11. We are very pleased with these results and the arc of progress in treating patients with CF as we continue to advance our ultimate goal of bringing all eligible patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride.Treatment with the vanza triple met all primary and secondary endpoints in the 3 Phase III studies, and once again, our proprietary HBE assays were both qualitatively and quantitatively predictive. In the SKYLINE 102 and 103 trials, the vanzacaftor triple combination met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority versus TRIKAFTA on ppFEV1, consistent with our expectations. The difference in ppFEV1 in the TRI and vanza treated groups was negligible.In SKYLINE 102, the LS mean difference was 0.2, numerically favoring vanza and meeting non-inferiority with a p-value of less than 0.0001. And in the SKYLINE 103 study, again, the difference in ppFEV1 in the TRI and vanza treated groups was negligible and numerically favored vanzacaftor, with LS mean difference of 0.2, meeting non-inferiority with a p-value of less than 0.0001.Recall the improvement in ppFEV1 in treatment-naive patients in the original TRI Phase III program was approximately 14%. In addition, all key secondary endpoints were met across SKYLINE 102 and 103 and showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in sweat chloride.The sweat chloride results were measured in 3 key secondary endpoints. First, the overall achieved sweat chloride levels in the 2 RCTs were lower in the vanza-treated group versus the TRIKAFTA-treated group. The LS mean difference was minus 8.4 with a p-value of less than 0.0001 in SKYLINE 102. The LS mean difference was minus 2.8 with a p-value of 0.0034 in SKYLINE 103.The key difference of course in SKYLINE 102 and 103 was the genotype studied. SKYLINE 102 included F/MF patients who have more severe disease and therefore higher sweat chloride levels at baseline, and SKYLINE 103 included F/F and other responsive mutations with lower baseline sweat chloride levels.Next, the second key secondary endpoint, a proportion of sweat chloride less than 60 millimoles pooled across 2 studies. 86% of patients in the vanza-treated groups and 77% of patients in the TRIKAFTA-treated groups achieved sweat chloride levels below 60 millimoles, leading to an odds ratio of 2.21 and a p-value of 0.0001. This means about 2x greater likelihood in the odds of achieving sweat chloride less than 60 with vanza versus TRIKAFTA.Last, the third key secondary endpoint, a proportion of sweat chloride less than 30 millimoles pooled across the 2 studies. 31% of patients in the vanza-treated groups versus 23% of patients in the TRIKAFTA-treated groups achieved sweat chloride levels below 30 millimolars, leading to an odds ratio of 2.87 and a p-value of 0.0001. This means about 3x greater likelihood in the odds of achieving sweat chloride less than 30 with vanzacaftor versus TRIKAFTA.The results were even more pronounced in the RIDGELINE study evaluating children ages 6 to 11. The primary endpoint in this single-arm study was safety, which I will come to in a minute. On efficacy, 95% of patients achieved sweat chloride below 60 millimole, the diagnostic threshold for cystic fibrosis, and more than half reached sweat chloride levels below the carrier level threshold of 30 millimoles. These sweat chloride results with the vanza triple are both impressive and important.Let me take a step back to frame the significance of these results. While CF is a systemic multi-organ disease, historically, the focus has been primarily on lung function as measured by ppFEV1, given it is the most visible symptom and typically the cause of death in CF patients. ppFEV1 is also the regulatory enabling endpoint.Given the strides we have made with TRIKAFTA, we believe we may have reached the maximum potential benefit in lung function from CFTR modulators. Thus, our objective with vanzacaftor moves beyond the focus on lung function to a broader, more ambitious goal to improve CFTR protein function as measured by lower sweat chloride levels and deliver even greater systemic benefit than TRIKAFTA.To be clear, the goal with the vanza pivotal development program was to show the lung function benefit was non-inferior to TRIKAFTA, and over and above that, to deliver additional benefit on sweat chloride, the direct marker of CFTR protein function. A note on CFTR protein. CFTR protein dysfunction is the underlying pathophysiology in CF. And while CF is often diagnosed by a genetic test at birth, it is confirmed via a sweat chloride test because it is the direct measure of CFTR protein dysfunction.Simply put, higher levels of sweat chloride associated with more severe disease. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to restore CFTR protein function, as measured by sweat chloride, back to normal or as close to normal as possible so that there is no manifestation of disease. And more specifically, sweat chloride values below 60 millimoles are associated with improved outcomes such as better and more stable lung function, fewer pulmonary exacerbations, better quality of life and improved survival.Vertex' ultimate treatment goal is to restore sweat chloride levels to below 30, which is considered normal and are typical of CF carriers who do not have the disease, for instance, the parents of children with CF. Thus, our goal in designing the vanzacaftor triple therapy studies was to test if even more patients treated with vanza could achieve those sweat chloride thresholds of less than 60 and less than 30 than those treated with TRIKAFTA.Switching to safety. The vanza triple was generally safe and well tolerated in all studies. The adverse events seen in the vanza triple pivotal development program are consistent with the underlying disease, and with the incidence and nature of adverse events we have seen with previous CFTR modulators. As a reminder and to round out the profile of the vanzacaftor triple, this therapy offers the convenience of once-daily dosing for patients and a substantially lower royalty burden.In summary, we set a goal to establish a new and higher bar in the treatment of CF with CFTR modulators, and with these Phase III vanza triple results, we have the first evidence that we have done so. And with these results, we now know that the vanza triple has indeed surpassed the very high bar set by TRIKAFTA in people with CF ages 6 and older. And by treating patients early with the vanza triple, we have the potential to possibly prevent systemic manifestations of CF in more people.These results also reaffirm our conviction that continued investment in scientific and serial innovation will allow us to complete our journey to transform CF by bringing all eligible CF patients down to carrier levels of sweat chloride where there are no manifestations of disease. I want to acknowledge the CF patients in our clinical trials who put their trust in us as well as the Vertex San Diego team and the CF R&D teams, some of whom have worked on CF for more than 20 years to deliver yet another potentially transformative medicine.We are working rapidly to compile the regulatory submissions and anticipate filing in both the U.S. and Europe for patients ages 6 and older by the middle of 2024. We will be using one of our priority review vouchers entitling us to designate the vanza NDA for priority review, which provides an expedited 6-month review versus a standard 10-month review time line.I'll close on CF with VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients who do not make any CFTR protein and therefore cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Late last year, we completed enrollment in dosing in the single ascending dose portion of our study for VX-522 and initiated the multiple ascending dose portion of the study. This study continues to screen and roll in dose patients, and we expect data late this year or early next.Turning now to CASGEVY, our precise durable CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that delivers a potential onetime functional cure for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. CASGEVY represents an enormous advancement for the estimated 35,000 people living with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia across the U.S. and Europe, as well as thousands of patients in other regions, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.CASGEVY represents a significant commercial opportunity as well, and Stuart will discuss the strong start to the launch following the rapid approvals in multiple countries. While these launches are underway, we are awaiting approval in the EU, where CASGEVY has received CHMP positive opinion for both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. CASGEVY is also under review in Switzerland, and we anticipate filing in Canada this quarter.Lastly on CASGEVY, recognizing the importance of treating patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia early in life to minimize organ damage and other complications of the disease, we are conducting studies in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia to expand the label to younger age groups. To that end, we recently completed enrollment in our 2 global Phase III studies in patients 5 to 11 years of age, and dosing in these studies is underway.Moving to the pain program and VX-548, our novel, highly selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor. With VX-548, we finally have the possibility of a medicine that has the compelling combination of both strong efficacy and strong safety that can be used for multiple moderate to severe pain types across multiple settings of care.Last week, we detailed the positive results from the 3 Phase III trials that comprise our pivotal program for VX-548 in acute pain, including randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 2 different pain models: abdominoplasty, a soft tissue pain model; and bunionectomy, a hard tissue pain model, and a single-arm safety and effectiveness trial in a broad range of surgical and nonsurgical pain conditions. Both the abdominoplasty and bunionectomy RCTs met the primary endpoint with statistically significant improvement in pain compared to placebo on the primary endpoint of SPID48.The SPID48 is derived from a change in the numeric pain rating scale or NPRS. Practicing physicians tell us that in addition to SPID48, they focus on this reduction in the NPRS from baseline, and this change in baseline in NPRS score is also how clinical meaningfulness is assessed in the field. In acute post-operative pain studies, clinical meaningfulness is defined by at least a 2-point change in NPRS from baseline or at least a 30% reduction in NPRS from baseline.In that context, both RCTs demonstrated that treatment with VX-548 led to rapid clinically meaningful reductions on the NPRS, with more than 3 points of pain reduction or roughly a 50% reduction from baseline in the VX-548 arms. The single arm safety and effectiveness trial was conducted in a broad range of surgical and nonsurgical pain conditions and supported longer-term safety and effectiveness. VX-548 was safe and well tolerated across all 3 studies, including multiple acute pain types and settings.Of importance, with respect to safety, in the 2 RCTs, the incidence of adverse events in the VX-548 arms was lower than placebo, an uncommon and noteworthy finding. We believe the results of this comprehensive Phase III program support a broad, moderate-to-severe acute pain label, and if approved, should enable prescribing and usage across multiple care settings. VX-548 has already secured Fast Track and Breakthrough designations, and we are working with urgency to file the NDA by mid-2024.Moving now to neuropathic pain. Two months ago, we also reported positive results from our Phase II study of VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, one type of peripheral neuropathic pain and another area of high unmet need. We look forward to our end of Phase II meeting with the FDA towards the end of this quarter and starting our Phase III program thereafter. We also continue to enroll and dose our second Phase II neuropathic pain study of VX-548 in lumbosacral radiculopathy or LSR.Ultimately, we seek a broad neuropathic pain label and believe by studying 2 of the largest pain segments, DPN and LSR, which together represent more than 60% of all peripheral neuropathic pain, we have a pathway to that broad indication. Just as we transform the treatment of CF, we believe we have the potential to transform the treatment of pain, both acute and neuropathic, based on the compelling and consistent results we have seen with VX-548.We now have results in hand from the Phase III program in acute pain as well as the Phase II results in DPN. We are underway with the Phase II study in LSR, and we are continuing to execute our portfolio approach of serial innovation. We are well on our way to helping address the unmet need of 90 million patients suffering with pain.With that, I'll now turn it over to Stuart."", 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Thanks, Reshma. With the recent approvals of CASGEVY in sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia in multiple countries and the recent positive results in our pivotal trials for VX-548 in acute pain and for the vanzacaftor triple combination in CF, we are well and truly entering a new era of commercial diversification.As Reshma noted, we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year commercial results in CF as we continue to grow the number of eligible patients receiving our CFTR modulators. Fourth quarter U.S. growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA, including in patients ages 2 to 5 years old following the approval for these patients in April. Outside the U.S., we saw continued growth from both label expansions and new reimbursement agreements.In the near term, we will continue to focus on reaching more eligible patients, including younger age groups, which will provide revenue growth, and then we expect to drive further growth with the vanzacaftor triple combination. Given the positive Phase III data we released today that demonstrates a strong benefit risk profile and the ability to deliver greater restoration of CFTR function than even TRIKAFTA, we believe the vanzacaftor triple combination will be widely welcomed by the CF community, both as a new treatment option for the greater than 6,000 patients who have discontinued one of our current CFTR modulators, and as an opportunity for TRIKAFTA patients to achieve even greater levels of CFTR function.Longer term, we see additional growth from our mRNA program, VX-522, that we are developing in partnership with Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients with mutations that do not respond to CFTR modulators. In addition, we recently updated our estimate of the number of people living with CF in North America, Europe and Australia to 92,000 from the previous estimate of 88,000. This increase is in large part due to patients living longer as a result of improvements in CF care, including the advent of CFTR modulators. We expect this trend to continue based on the real-world evidence we have generated on the clinical benefits of CFTR modulators, and this will also drive long-term growth.Now turning to CASGEVY and our launches in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Enthusiasm from patients, physicians and payers is very high around the globe, and we are focused on translating the scientific and medical innovation that CASGEVY represents into transformative patient benefit in the real world. In countries where CASGEVY has been approved, our sales, reimbursement and access teams as well as patient engagement teams have hit the ground running. Let me provide some insights on the early days of the launch.Starting with physicians. There is tremendous interest in CASGEVY and what it can do for their patients, and we see the impact of that in the rapid activation of authorized treatment centers. Less than 2 months post approval, we already have 12 ATCs in the U.S., 3 in the EU and 1 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, all ready to receive patients.Reaction from payers has also been very positive. In the U.S., across commercial and government payers, all eligible CASGEVY patients have case-by-case coverage through single case agreements. We continue to see excellent progress from payers on the development of their formal medical policies and reimbursement pathways. We have a contract in place with Synergie for up to 100 million lives and are actively engaged with other commercial payers to finalize medical policies, which would bring the total percentage of covered lives to over 80%.In the government sector, Medicaid state agencies representing over 60% of sickle cell disease lives have established reimbursement pathways for CASGEVY, with an additional 25% of Medicaid sickle cell disease lives in states actively progressing their reimbursement methodologies. In addition, we were pleased to have received the January approval in the U.S. for CASGEVY for transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients 2.5 months early and are working to achieve a similarly fast trajectory for gaining reimbursement and access for patients.Last week, there was an important update by the Biden administration on the CMMI Cell and Gene Therapy Access Demonstration Model that was originally announced in February of 2023 and was recently accelerated for implementation from 2026 to 2025. We believe the CMMI CGT Access Model could be an important additional path to access, and we now have greater clarity on the scope and process to be employed in the model. The model is intended to provide a comprehensive strategy to address barriers to equitable access to cell and gene therapies for Medicaid beneficiaries as well as the long-standing inequities of care in the sickle cell disease community.Last week's update also confirmed additional federal funding to support access and included a defined scope of manufacturer-provided fertility support in the model in recognition that for patients choosing to embark on the treatment journey, the costs of fertility preservation are a barrier to access. In the meantime, we continue to actively engage with state Medicaid agencies to finalize medical policies for CASGEVY even in advance of the CGT Access Model to ensure patient access without delay.Outside the U.S., we are pleased that the French National Authority for Health has approved our request for the implementation of an early access program or EAP for TDT patients ages 12 to 35 years. We are delighted to have secured a path to access and payment in France ahead of a national reimbursement agreement and are also in an EAP review process for sickle cell disease patients. In the U.K., CASGEVY will be reviewed by the highly specialized technology committee in February, and we are advancing our reimbursement discussions in other European countries as well.We also see strong progress in the Middle East, which is especially important for CASGEVY, given the high prevalence of these diseases in the region and the government's clear focus on elevating the health of their citizens. We are working with local health care authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to refine our estimates of the exact number of eligible patients, but there are thousands of patients we could serve, and we are focused on securing access and reimbursement for them. We have established a local presence in the region, have already activated our first ATC and are working with local health care professionals to expand the number of ATCs and establish the required infrastructure to meet patient demand.As we have previously outlined, the CASGEVY patient journey can be broken down into 3 key phases, each of which can take several months: pretreatment; cell collection and manufacturing; and then infusion of the edited cells. We are pleased with the early days of what will be a foundational year for CASGEVY as we work to deliver transformative patient outcomes with the possibility of a lifetime of benefit. We look forward to updating you on the CASGEVY launch over the course of this year.To help track our progress, our expectation is to provide quarterly updates on the number of activated ATCs as well as the number of patients in the cell collection phase. ATCs have begun assessing their patients for the ability to be treated with CASGEVY, and we expect that the first commercial patients will start the journey in the coming weeks.Shifting now to VX-548. We are very excited about the potential for this highly selective NaV1.8 inhibitor to provide a transformative treatment option for the millions of patients suffering from acute and peripheral neuropathic pain. This quarter, I'll limit my comments to acute pain. As we discussed last week, when we shared the results from the pivotal program, we are very excited about VX-548's compelling combination of efficacy and safety and the demonstration that it can be used for moderate to severe pain across a range of pain conditions, both surgical and nonsurgical and across a range of settings.If approved, VX-548 will be the first of a new class of medicines that inhibit the pain signal and represent the first new class of medicines for acute pain in over 20 years. The reason we're so excited about the potential for VX-548 to positively impact patient care is because we estimate approximately 80 million patients are prescribed a medicine for moderate to severe acute pain every year in the U.S., representing over 1 billion calendar days of treatment.Given this massive patient population, acute pain is a multibillion dollar market today despite the fact that essentially all prescriptions are generic. We also see upside to this market opportunity, given the significant unmet need that stems from the suboptimal benefit risk profiles of existing agents such as the limited efficacy but acceptable side effects of NSAIDs or the adverse effects and addiction potential of opioids, all of which leads to suboptimal pain management.What physicians and patients seek is a medicine that combines effective relief of moderate to severe pain with a clear safety and tolerability profile, and VX-548 delivers on that profile. We've previously shared our go-to-market strategy, and we are now actively recruiting our field force in anticipation of our regulatory filing and approval. The commercial team will focus on the roughly 2,000 hospitals and institutions where a majority of acute pain patients are seen and prescriptions are written. We continue to see a multibillion dollar opportunity for VX-548 in acute pain alone.The well-known risk of opioids have led to widespread restrictions and limitations on their use over the years. Increasingly, we are seeing a paradigm shift in policy initiatives across various stakeholders to encourage consideration and use of non-opioid alternatives and to remove financial barriers to choosing a branded non-opioid. As an example, late last month, Congress introduced the bipartisan alternatives to Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act or the alternatives to pain act.If enacted, Medicare Part D plans would be required to set co-pays for non-opioids like VX-548 in line with co-pays for generic opioids, which are typically between $0 and $15. The bill would also prohibit Medicare Part D plans from requiring seniors to step through opioids first or requiring prior authorization for non-opioids. In addition, the NOPAIN Act or Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act, which was enacted in late 2022, provides for an add-on payment for non-opioids in the outpatient and ambulatory surgery center settings and remains on track to go into effect in 2025.And just recently, 7 states: Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia, have pending legislation that would require education on non-opioid options and would remove financial barriers to patient access within state-based health insurance programs like Medicaid. We expect additional states to introduce similar legislation later this year. We believe that these advances in federal and state legislation represent further momentum in Congress and across the U.S. to encourage adoption of and remove any financial barriers to using non-opioid therapies like VX-548.In conclusion, it's an incredibly exciting time at Vertex. We continue to treat more CF patients around the world, and with the vanza triple, now have visibility to provide an option for the patients who have discontinued CFTR modulators as well as the possibility to bring even more patients below diagnostic levels and even to carrier levels of sweat chloride.We're entering a new era of commercial diversification with the launch of CASGEVY, the first ever gene-edited therapy that brings a potential functional cure to patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia across multiple regions, and we are preparing for additional near-term launches with significant market potential, including VX-548 in acute pain.I'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials."", 'Charles F. Wagner', ""Thanks, Stuart. Vertex' excellent results in the fourth quarter of 2023 demonstrate once again our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. Fourth quarter 2023 revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $2.52 billion and was nicely balanced with revenue growth of 8% in the U.S and 12% outside the U.S. Full year revenue of $9.87 billion represents 11% growth versus 2022, our ninth consecutive year of at least double-digit growth. Overall, the primary drivers of revenue growth in 2023 were in line with our expectations.Fourth quarter 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1 billion compared to $872 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Included in Q4 '23 results are $18 million of acquired IP R&D charges compared to $23 million of such charges in the fourth quarter of 2022. Note that with the approval of CASGEVY in the fourth quarter, cost for manufacturing capacity for CASGEVY are now being recorded in cost of goods sold rather than in R&D. Full year 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $4.24 billion compared to $3.07 billion in 2022.Fourth quarter and full year operating expense growth was driven as expected by continued investment in research and our pipeline as we have now advanced assets into the clinic in 9 different disease areas. In the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, the most significant areas of increased investment versus prior year included the pivotal studies for VX-548 in acute pain and the vanzacaftor triple in CF, the Phase I/II study for type 1 diabetes as well as the build-out of capabilities for both our expanding pipeline and our anticipated near-term commercial launches.In addition, approximately $400 million of the year-over-year increase in operating expenses was the result of increased AIP R&D costs from new business development. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $1.15 billion consistent with $1.15 billion in non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $4.37 billion compared to $4.79 billion in 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 effective tax rate of 16.3% reflects an increase in our 2023 U.S. R&D tax credits. This benefit lowered the Q4 rate and brought the full year 2023 effective tax rate to 19.4%, slightly below our guidance range of 20% to 21%.Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.20, representing 12% growth compared to $3.76 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share were $15.23 compared to $14.88 in 2022. We ended the quarter with $13.7 billion in cash and investments. Our priorities for cash deployment remain unchanged as we continue to prioritize investment in innovation, including external innovation via business development. During 2023, we completed 10 transactions and recognized over $500 million of AIP R&D. We also deployed over $400 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares over the course of 2023.Now switching to guidance. For 2024, we expect total product revenue in a range of $10.55 billion to $10.75 billion, representing revenue growth of 8% at the midpoint at current exchange rates. Included in this outlook is our expectation for continued growth in CF as we continue to reach more patients, including younger ones, in core markets and select other countries. Guidance also includes contribution from the commercial launch of CASGEVY in approved indications and geographies.We continue to expect a foundational year for CASGEVY in 2024 as we ramp up patient initiations and build toward a multibillion dollar market opportunity over time. We are providing total product revenue guidance rather than specifics by disease area or product given the inherent uncertainty of new launches as well as the significant disparity and size of our established CF business relative to other revenues.As a reminder, on the accounting for CASGEVY and the CRISPR profit share arrangement, Vertex will book 100% of revenues for CASGEVY. The profit share with CRISPR calculated after product and commercial costs will be recorded in cost of goods sold. Any ongoing research and development costs will be recorded in operating expenses net of CRISPR's share.For total Vertex operating expenses, we project $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion in full year 2024 combined non-GAAP SG&A, R&D and acquired IP R&D. This operating expense range includes approximately $125 million in currently anticipated IP R&D charges. We continue to invest a majority of our operating expenses into R&D given the momentum in our multiple mid- and late-stage clinical development programs.Note that the costs for multiple Phase III studies have been a significant driver of our growth in our total operating expenses in recent years. Given that a number of Phase III studies were completed as we entered 2024, we were able to fund new additional Phase III studies without the same rate of growth in operating expenses.While we have substantially completed our commercial investments for CASGEVY, we're also funding the expansion of our commercial capabilities in anticipation of other multibillion dollar opportunities represented by our programs with near-term launch potential while continuing to leverage an attractive business model afforded by our focus in specialty markets. With a more normalized impact from U.S. R&D tax credits in 2024, our full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%.In closing, Vertex delivered excellent results yet again in 2023, achieving strong revenue growth, important regulatory approvals and commercial launches and positive pivotal trial results that will enable additional near-term launches. We also made progress in our earlier stage pipeline, with proof of concept for VX-548 in neuropathic pain and anticipated advancement of 2 additional disease areas into the clinic. We also made substantial investments behind our programs and commercial capabilities for near-term launches.As we head into 2024, we anticipate further important milestones as highlighted on Slide 20, to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls, and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&A period."", 'Susie Lisa', ""Thanks, Charlie. Just to note, given the multiple positive updates this quarter and thus the longer duration of our prepared remarks, we'll plan to go to about 5:40 this evening, so as to allow 30 minutes for your questions. Chuck, please go ahead and assemble the queue."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Ms. Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.', 'Salveen Jaswal Richter', ""Congratulations on the data. Two questions for me. One is, with regard to the initial patient you'll be targeting with the next-generation CF program, could you just elaborate whether it's switch patients or patients who have discontinued, naive patients here and where you anticipate the most demand?And then secondly, on the CASGEVY launch, in light of the Innovation Cell and Gene Therapy Access Demonstration Model, how do you work that into the launch at this point? And is there an overhang as you have to determine how these outcome-based agreements may play out?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', 'Sure thing, Salveen. Let me turn it over to Stuart for both the question on vanza commercialization and on the CASGEVY launch with the focus on the CMMI question.', 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Yes, Salveen. So in answer to your first question on vanzacaftor, the answer is both. I think vanzacaftor is going to be an attractive treatment option, both for patients who are currently being treated who might want superior control of their CFTR function, because both patients and physicians know that CFTR function and dysfunction is the underlying cause of CF, and so if you can further improve CFTR function, you're going to get better clinical outcomes down the line.So I think we're going to see interest from those who are currently being treated, but I also think we're going to see a lot of interest from patients who previously discontinued one of our CFTR modulators, given the profile that we've demonstrated today. And then on CASGEVY, a couple of comments, really. The first one I would make is we're very excited about the demo and the opportunity to work with CMS for those states who are interested in working with CMS and are interested in outcomes-based agreements. I don't particularly see that being a delay for a couple of reasons.One, we're already working with many state Medicaid agencies. We're not waiting for the demo before we secure access for patients who are covered by Medicaid. And then secondly, in terms of do I think it's going to be complex and be a delay to negotiate outcomes-based agreements? I don't, really.If you look at the profile of CASGEVY, it is so incredibly strong that really we're talking about an outcomes-based agreement, which is looking at whether a very, very small number of patients may not respond. And so I don't think it's an outcomes-based agreement where there's lots of uncertainty and difficulty with the outcomes and metrics and endpoints. And so I don't expect that to be particularly challenging."", 'Operator', 'Next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.', 'Geoffrey Christopher Meacham', ""Congrats on the data. On vanza, I just have a couple of questions. Can you follow SKYLINE or RIDGELINE in an extension? I'm just trying to think if you can pick up more differentiation versus TRIKAFTA just in terms of maybe exacerbations or measuring pancreatic sufficiency over a longer period. I guess ultimately, where I'm going is that sweat chloride isn't readily used in the clinic for treatment decisions, so I'm trying to see rationale for maybe switching a patient away from TRIKAFTA if they're stable."", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Yes. Thanks, Geoff. This is Reshma. Let me take that one. When we think about the patients who were enrolled in both the SKYLINE trial, so the 12-year olds and above, and the RIDGELINE patients, 6 to 11, there are already extension studies. So those patients have the opportunity to roll over into open-label extended studies just like we did with TRIKAFTA.And I do suspect you're right about the ability to evaluate and document the overall improvements in patients with CF lives over time. And just to give you a sense for what I'm looking at and why I say that, if you look in the safety tables that were one of the slides, unsurprisingly, the most common or one of the most common AEs in this patient population is pulmonary exacerbation.And if you look, there are less pulmonary exacerbations numerically in those safety tables in the patients on vanza than on the patients who are on TRIKAFTA. And TRIKAFTA is an amazing drug that has already documented improvements in pulmonary exacerbation and other longer-term outcomes.So I do think you're very correct that we'll be able to pick up these long-term outcomes as these patients are followed in the open-label extension studies and then as they are followed in registries, and we are very fortunate in CF that the registries already exists and the vast majority of patients with cystic fibrosis are followed in registries."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.', 'Mohit Bansal', ""Just following up on Geoff's question. So how commonly doctors check sweat chloride levels as part of -- I know it is for diagnostic purposes, but do they check it for -- do they test it for prescribing as well? Or it is something that you will have to educate these adopters on that?And then my follow-up is actually on the COGS for Charlie, cost of goods sold. As you think about 2024, what happened in 2023 fourth quarter was a onetime movement from R&D to COGS which drove it? Or is this something that we to continue more going forward?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Let me ask Charlie to tackle the COGS question first, and I'll come back and tell you about sweat chloride in clinical practice."", 'Charles F. Wagner', 'Yes, Mohit. In the fourth quarter, because CASGEVY was approved in the U.S., we started treating it as a commercial product, and therefore we took some of the manufacturing costs that previously had been recorded in R&D and moved them up to cost of goods sold. Those manufacturing costs will remain in cost of goods sold going forward.', 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Mohit, with regard to sweat chloride measurement in clinical practice, you're very correct. In terms of diagnosis, patients in the Western world are diagnosed by a gene test, a genetic test, when -- oftentimes when patients are born or when people are born, and then that's confirmed with the sweat chloride test. If the number is above 60, that diagnosis of CF, if it's between 30 and 60 millimoles for sweat chloride, that's indeterminate and if it's less than 30, that is not diagnosed as CF.This is not a metric. Sweat chloride is not a measure that's followed routinely in clinical practice. But what physicians understand very well, especially pulmonologists who are CF experts, is that the underlying cause of disease in CF is dysfunction of the CFTR protein. That's very well understood. And further, that a direct readout of that CFTR protein function is sweat chloride. So I think the concepts are very well understood, but sweat chloride other than the diagnosis is not a commonly used test in the clinic."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Phil Nadeau with TD Cowen.', 'Philip M. Nadeau', ""Let us add our congratulations on another positive pivotal program. One on sweat chloride, then one actually on the pain data that you released last week. First, on the sweat chloride, it does look like TRIKAFTA gets a decent proportion of patients to below 60 millimole per liter and below 30 millimole per liter.Do you have data following the patients who've been on TRIKAFTA for a long time to show better outcomes for those TRIKAFTA patients who got to low levels of sweat chloride, which then presumably you could extrapolate to the vanza triple and show a higher proportion of patients would have good outcomes? That's the first question.And then the second question on the pain data released last week. It does seem like the bunionectomy Phase III trial underperformed the Phase IIs that you had previously released as well as the abdominoplasty Phase III released last week. Was there anything different about that trial which would have caused 548 to act less potently there than it had in the prior studies?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Yes. Phil, let me take bunionectomy, abdominoplasty, VX-548 first, and then we'll come back to sweat chloride. You know what I actually find remarkable, Phil, is the -- how consistently 548 has performed. That, to me, is more striking than the smaller differences in bunionectomy readout Phase II to Phase III or across from bunionectomy to abdominoplasty.So if I look at the totality of the VX-548 evidence, and it's easy enough to do because the structure of the study design was very similar in Phase II as Phase III and we have the same dose, the high dose from Phase II, you'll see that bunionectomy and abdominoplasty performed virtually identically. Like the SPID48 was something like 40 points or something like that. I think that was the actual number.And then when you move to Phase III, again, positive studies against placebo. In the grand scheme of things, this is remarkable because as you know, the conduct of clinical trials in the pain field is notoriously difficult. Placebo effects move around significantly. The effect of any comparator group moves around significantly.So when I look at the totality of the data, and for me, that means looking at the data from Phase II to Phase III, and it also means looking at the SPID48, let's focus on bunionectomy, in bunionectomy, and connecting that with the NPRS. Remember, the NPRS is the actual score that feeds the SPID48, which is an integration of NPRS over time.So if you look at the NPRS data, it's -- the decrease in the NPRS is 3.4 points in bunionectomy, it's 3.4 points in abdominoplasty start to hour 48. And it's about a 50% decrease in terms of the relative decrease. And when you look at that in comparison to Norco, the opioid we used in the trial, that number is 3.2 in abdominoplasty, 3.6 in bunionectomy and it's approximately a 50% reduction in terms of the relative change. So I put that all together, and I see quite a bit of consistency and very good therapeutic effectiveness and efficacy.On sweat chloride. So it's a really, really great question. And in order to sort of really understand this, you have to triangulate a couple of different data points. One data point is around just the natural history and the genetics of this disease. So take, for example, patients who are F/MF versus those who are F/RF, F/MF patients have very high sweat chlorides and have more severe disease. F/RF patients, the residual function patients, have relatively better sweat chloride levels and relatively less severe disease. That's one set of data.And then to your point, if you look at interventional data, the data that we have, the greatest reduction in ppFEV1, sweat chloride and long-term evidence is TRIKAFTA. And if you compare that to KALYDECO, for example, you can see where TRIKAFTA does even better than KALYDECO. And the best example I can give you is on rate of decline. The TRIKAFTA real-world data on rate of decline shows there is no decline.And until we got to TRIKAFTA, what we could show is we slowed the rate of decline. And so I have every reason in the world to believe as the vanzacaftor triple is used over a longer time point and we get CFTR protein function to higher levels, and the Vanza triple has given us the best, highest achieved CFTR protein levels, I do think we're going to see long-term benefit. And yes, you can do all of that math and triangulation from the available data."", 'Operator', 'Next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.', 'Robyn Kay Shelton Karnauskas', ""So commercialization, I know it's really hard switching from one drug to the next. Can you walk me through switching from TRIKAFTA to the next drug. And like given that people are stable, their lung functions are great, how would you think about what motivates commercial Europe as well as U.S. to allow people to stay on drug and like move to a next-generation drug?And I think -- I'm coming from the point of like I remember from a long time ago, the people had a hard time switching from one drug to the other. And I want to understand like more like how you actually help people, help commercial organizations switch from one to the next."", 'Reshma Kewalramani', 'Stuart?', 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Yes, Robyn, thanks. So I must confess our experience is a little bit different to that. We've seen very rapid transitions from our medicines as we've serially innovated and delivered better and better medicines. And even, for instance, when we introduced TRIKAFTA and patients who had been on KALYDECO, for instance, for a very long time, and obviously, KALYDECO had set a very, very high bar for efficacy. We did see rapid adoption with TRIKAFTA, even in those patients, given that it had a clear benefit/risk profile.So I think we've seen relatively rapid transitions for our medicines as we've serially innovated. And interestingly, the design of the study actually gives a proof for the fact that patients can effectively transition from TRIKAFTA to vanzacaftor because, as Reshma mentioned in her remarks, the design of the study was to have people stable on 4 weeks of TRIKAFTA therapy to establish a baseline, and they were then randomized to either continue on TRIKAFTA or transition to vanzacaftor. So we have, within the study, real-world evidence of people being able to transition.And then you'll ask me what do I think is going to motivate people to want to consider the vanzacaftor triple combination? I think it's the benefit/risk profile that we've been able to demonstrate here. We're achieving higher levels of sweat chloride reduction than with any of our previous medicines, including now TRIKAFTA, and the fact that this is a once-a-day therapy. So as I've said a number times, I think with this profile, we're going to see a lot of enthusiasm from the CF community."", 'Robyn Kay Shelton Karnauskas', ""So follow-up question for you is what about the payers and the governments in Europe? Do they believe -- and like you've had very stable levels of lung function with TRIKAFTA, do you think that people will focus on like that? Or do they need more data moving forward?"", 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Well, I mean, I think we've had a long track of working with payers on cystic fibrosis for again of well over a decade now. So I think there's a significant amount of understanding about the disease. Obviously, we'll be presenting the data to vanzacaftor to payers in a compliant manner at the right time.The one other thing would I note about the vanzacaftor triple combination is it's likely to be indicated for a very similar population of patients to TRIKAFTA, which I do think is going to make this launch, from a payer perspective, a bit different to previous launches, as you will recall, because you've been on this journey with us for a while.When we launched ORKAMBI, we were moving from kind of single-digit numbers of eligible patients to a medicine that could potentially treat up to 50% of CF patients. When we then brought TRIKAFTA forward, we were moving it towards being able to treat 90% of patients. Vanza is going to likely have a very similar label to TRIKAFTA, and so it's not likely to be as scary, I would suggest to payers, in terms of a big budget impact hit."", 'Operator', 'Next question will come from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.', 'Jessica Macomber Fye', 'Great. Can you set expectations around how you see the cadence of patients initiating the CASGEVY journey for us?', 'Reshma Kewalramani', 'Sure thing. Stuart?', 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Yes, Jess. So I think we've described the patient journey for CASGEVY. It has kind of these multiple phases from patients being evaluated by their physician and deciding with their physician that this is the journey that they want to go on. You then have to go through the cell collection and manufacturing process and then the cells are infused. Each of those steps can take a number of months. And as you know, we've said that we'll be recognizing revenue at the point of infusion.So in contrast to our cystic fibrosis launches, which have really seen incredibly rapid uptake, we have said that we are expecting this launch to be more like a traditional biopharma launch, but we are expecting this, and we have said we are expecting this, to be a foundational year for us as we build momentum around CASGEVY. Having said that, in terms of the destination, we continue to believe that the destination for CASGEVY is going to be used in thousands of patients and represents a multibillion dollar opportunity."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital.', 'Evan David Seigerman', ""I know there's a lot on the vanza triple, but kind of -- can you maybe walk us through some of the clinical considerations as you would get to maybe have a physician switch patient? And then thinking about kind of potential TRIKAFTA quitters returning on drug, what does that conversation look like? And I guess, maybe more specifically, why would a patient discontinue TRIKAFTA and why would they want to reinitiate with the vanza triple?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Sure thing, Evan. I think Stuart has talked about this, and maybe I'll shorthand it by saying we have the approximately 6,000 patients who are in the system. They are known to have CF. They are seen by a CF provider. They used to be on TRIKAFTA. So they're not lost, they simply have discontinued it either because of an adverse event or perhaps because of compliance. TRIKAFTA (inaudible). Vanza is, of course, once a day.So we see those 6,000 patients potentially coming back, and the short version of the conversation would be they're coming to see their doctor, usually CF patients are seen by their doctor once a quarter, so when they return, the conversation might be something like, if and when vanza is approved, there's a new drug. It has this safety. It has this efficacy. Do you want to try it? You had tried a medicine before. This is a new one. And the doctor and patient would have a communication about that.So the patients who are already on TRIKAFTA and are doing well, I suspect it's going to be just like it was from SYMDEKO and ORKAMBI to TRIKAFTA or from KALYDECO to TRIKAFTA. Our CF patients are very educated patients. They know what clinical trials are going on. They know what potential medicines might be coming down the pipe, and they are interested in being treated with the most effective medicine, the medicine with the best benefit/risk.And they do this because it is a disease that starts at birth and is with them their entire life. Now with the life expectancy, based on modeled data, being in the 80s, I do think the idea is that we can get patients to as close to normal as possible, at least we're on that journey with vanza is an attractive option for physicians and patients. And I suspect that's what that conversation is going to be about."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.', 'Christopher Joseph Raymond', ""Congrats from us as well on the data. Just 2 questions, if possible. First maybe on CASGEVY. We've gotten some physician feedback that, of course, access is a barrier to uptake. But maybe a surprise that we got from some of the questions we've asked is that transplant center capacity and prioritization of non-oncology patients is also sort of a consideration.Just curious, as you activate these ATCs, maybe talk about transplant capacity. Does this factor into the discussions as you're activating these sites? And then maybe on vanzacaftor, I know you guys have described the royalty differential. I think TRIKAFTA is in the low double digits, and you've described vanzacaftor as down in the single digits. But are there plans to put some guardrails around this leverage improvement as you get closer to launch of the vanza triple?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""I'm sorry, Chris, I didn't follow the question on the vanza triple. I got you on CASGEVY. Is it about the royalties?"", 'Christopher Joseph Raymond', 'Yes, sorry. On -- yes, just on the leverage and the royalty differential. I think you guys described the difference, but are there plans to put guardrails around that leverage as people model that?', 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Yes. Yes. Sure thing. Let me take CASGEVY quickly, turn it over to Stuart and then we'll just do one minute real quick with Charlie, and he'll tell you about the royalty structure for vanza.Real quickly on CASGEVY, we have not heard of there being a center capacity issue. And honestly, we have not heard about challenges for reimbursement. We've actually had very positive reception from payers. But I'll turn it over to Stuart to make a quick comment on activation and his perspective."", 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Yes. And we're making great progress, Chris, I would say, activating authorized treatment centers just here in the U.S. We're now up to 12, and I don't think those centers would be going through the effort of becoming an activated treatment center if they weren't fully intending to treat patients with CASGEVY. And then as Reshma said, the reaction we've had from payers has been really positive.I think they're incredibly impressed with the clinical data. They are well aware of the unmet need in sickle cell disease and indeed transfusion-dependent thalassemia and the burden that places on patients and indeed the health care system. They like the label that we've got, and they like our value-based price. And so I've been very encouraged by the conversations we've been having with payers, and I'm fully expecting us to be able to secure great access for sickle cell disease and TDT patients."", 'Reshma Kewalramani', 'Charlie, a word on royalties.', 'Charles F. Wagner', ""Yes, just briefly on the royalties bit, Chris. The blended royalty rate on our current CF portfolio is just under 10%. And so high single digit, call it. And we expect with the vanza triple, that royalty burden will be meaningfully lower in the single digits. No additional color to add today. And then, of course, if you want to model the impact of that, you have to factor in the rate of switching from TRI and other medicines again. So as we get closer to commercialization, we'll have more to say."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Colin Bristow with UBS.', 'Colin Nigel Bristow', ""Congrats on all the data. Maybe first on the vanza triplet. Can you say if there are any cases of AST or ALT elevations greater than 3 or 5x the upper limit of normal? And then secondly, I see that you've now got 3 follow-on pain assets in clinic: 993, 973 and 708. Could you just give us more color on how you expect them to be differentiated and just elaborate a bit more on the strategy from here?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Yes. Sure thing, Colin. Quickly on LFT elevations with the vanzacaftor triple. As with all of the CFTR modulators, there are some elevations in LFTs. They're approximately the same with the vanzacaftor triple as with TRIKAFTA.On the pain program, Colin, this is exactly what you saw us do in CF and frankly, what you should expect from us across the portfolio. And that is to say a portfolio approach to every disease in our sandbox. If there is a way to improve on our assets, we aim to be the ones who do so.So a couple of examples of what we're doing with 993, for example. 993 is a medicine that may be able to be dosed both oral and IV, and we're pursuing both. We believe that there is a real opportunity here for a patient to come into hospital and have 993 or one of our NaV1.8 inhibitors be the medicine that they get for pain relief, let's say, intraoperatively. And then when they can take by mouth, then they can switch to 548, 993, as an example.Another example that we're working on, you know that we also have a pipeline of NaV1.7 inhibitors. Those are still in preclinical development, but they are making good progress. So one of the other elements we're working on is formulations in terms of drug-drug interactions and the possibility to combine. So NaV1.7 could be a molecule as a single agent therapy or it could also be a therapy in combination with the NaV1.8. That's kind of a sense for what we're doing with our follow-on approach."", 'Operator', 'Our last question for the evening will come from Myles Minter with William Blair.', 'Myles Robert Minter', ""You just mentioned the first commercial patients on CASGEVY are expected to start the journey in the coming weeks. Can you clarify what geographies they are in? And do you have a sense of how many patients you've screened out at those ATCs to identify those first patients?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Sure thing.

The company's gene-editing therapy for a duo of blood-related disorders, Casgevy, earned the nod in several countries. This development capped off another excellent year for the drugmaker, one during which -- as usual -- it crushed the market."", ""However, at least on the clinical front, Vertex isn't exactly starting 2024 with a bang. The company recently released positive but somewhat disappointing data from a phase 3 clinical trial for one of its otherwise promising drug candidates. Let's take a closer look at this news and what it means for investors."", ""There is no shortage of medications for acute pain on the market, including some that can easily be acquired over the counter. Still, many of them, particularly those that contain opioids, come with severe potential side effects, not to mention the possibility of abuse. Vertex's goal is to develop pain meds that can be as effective as opioid-based ones but without similarly detrimental side effects."", ""In a phase 3 study for its top candidate in this area, VX-548, the biotech reported that the investigational medicine delivered positive results. That is, it was able to help patients with moderate or severe acute pain who had undergone abdominoplasty surgery (better known as a tummy tuck) or bunionectomy surgery (to remove foot bumps). But there's a catch."", 'Besides the placebo group, the study also compared VX-548 with a combination of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen (hydrocodone is an opioid). VX-548 did not perform nearly as well as the opioid pain treatment it was pitted against in managing acute pain in patients following bunionectomy surgery.', ""What do these results mean for Vertex Pharmaceuticals? Although the company still plans on seeking approval for VX-548 in acute pain, it may no longer be the exciting opportunity the biotech thought it would be. However, that means very little for Vertex's future. Let's consider three reasons why."", ""First, Vertex's signature cystic fibrosis (CF) franchise continues to perform well. The drugmaker reported revenue of $7.4 billion through Sept. 30, equaling an 11% year-over-year increase. Vertex's net income grew by 6% to $2.7 billion. The company has yet to start treatment on about 20,000 patients (out of 92,000) eligible for its current CF medicines."", ""Second, Casgevy's recent approval is an important one. Although Vertex will have to share the profits and costs associated with Casgevy with CRISPR Therapeutics, its partner on this project, the therapy's potential is huge.\xa0It carries a price tag of $2.2 million and has an initial target market of about 35,000 patients."", 'Third, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has plenty of other exciting candidates. VX-548 is also being developed to treat neuropathic pain. The biotech has a CF medicine in the pipeline that is supposed to report data from late-stage studies this year, and that could be even more effective than its current drugs.', ""Vertex is also developing VX-864 and inaxaplin to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and APOL1-mediated kidney disease, respectively. There are no treatments that address the underlying causes of either disease, and both have patient populations of about 100,000 people. That's how the company made a fortune in CF -- it created medicines that targeted the underlying causes of the disease when nobody else could."", ""Vertex's pipeline has other intriguing candidates, including one that could be a functional cure for type 1 diabetes. Since VX-548 was still effective at treating pain, it should earn regulatory approval. But the company could launch at least a couple more products in the next five years."", ""In short, the biotech's prospects remain bright despite VX-548's somewhat mixed results. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is still a top biotech stock to buy."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

In 2023, Vertex continued to reach more CF patients and achieved full year CF product revenues of 9.87 billion, representing 11% growth versus 2022."", ""Following the historic approvals of CASGEVY, the first ever CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy. Our launches off and running globally as we are now approved in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in the U.S., Great Britain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. CASGEVY is a one-time, precise, durable CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing therapy that is generating strong enthusiasm from physicians and patients and excellent support from payers. We're also working toward multiple additional near-term commercial opportunities, driving toward our five launches in five-years goal."", 'The recent approvals for CASGEVY in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia delivered the first two. Now, with the positive phase 3 results from VX-548 in acute pain and for the vanzacaftor triple therapy in CF, these are potentially the next two. And with a strong clinical stage pipeline with first-in-class or best-in-class assets, we are well on our way to our goal of five launches by 2028. In addition to the rapidly advancing clinical stage pipeline, the next wave of innovation also continues to make progress.', 'And as we announced last month, we are pleased to be advancing two new disease areas into the clinic. First, myotonic dystrophy type 1, or DM1, a serious disease with high unmet need and no approved therapies. This disease affects approximately 110,000 patients in North America and Europe. Our DM1 program represents our ninth disease area to advance into the clinic.', 'We already initiated a phase 1/2 study in patients, that is to say a study that will be able to assess both safety and efficacy late last year. And second, we expect to advance into our 10th disease area in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, or ADPKD, the most common genetic kidney disease that affects approximately 250,000 patients in the U.S. and E.U. alone into the clinic with a healthy volunteer study in the first half of this year.', ""With that overview, let me now turn to a more detailed pipeline review. This quarter, I'll limit my comments to the programs with significant recent updates: cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and pain, so as to leave time for your questions. Starting with cystic fibrosis and our next-in-class vanzacaftor triple combination therapy. This afternoon, we reported positive results from the phase three 3, including the SKYLINE 102 and 103 studies in patients 12 years and above and the RIDGELINE study in patients ages 6 to 11."", 'We are very pleased with these results and the arc of progress in treating patients with CF as we continue to advance our ultimate goal of bringing all eligible patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. Treatment with the vanzacaftor triple met all primary and secondary endpoints in the three phase 3 studies. And once again, our proprietary HBE assays were both qualitative and quantitatively predictive. In the SKYLINE 102 and 103 trials, the vanzacaftor triple combination met its primary endpoint of noninferiority versus TRIKAFTA on ppFEV1, consistent with our expectations.', 'The difference in ppFEV1 in the TRI- and vanza-treated groups was negligible. In SKYLINE 102, the LS mean difference was 0.2, numerically favoring vanza and meeting noninferiority with a P value of less than 0.0001. And in the SKYLINE 103 study, again, the difference in ppFEV1 in the TRI- and vanza-treated groups was negligible and numerically favored vanzacaftor with LS mean difference of 0.2, meeting noninferiority, with a P value of less than 0.0001. Recall the improvement in ppFEV1 in treatment-naive patients in the original TRI phase 3 program was approximately 14%.', 'In addition, all key secondary endpoints were met across SKYLINE 102 and 103 and showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in sweat chloride. The sweat chloride results were measured in three key secondary endpoints. First, the overall achieved sweat chloride levels in the two RCTs were lower in the vanza-treated group versus the TRIKAFTA-treated group. The LS mean difference was negative 8.4 with a P value of less than 0.0001.', 'In SKYLINE 102, The mean difference was minus 2.8 with a P value of 0.0034 in SKYLINE 103. The key difference, of course, in SKYLINE 102 and 103 was the genotype studied. SKYLINE 102 included FMF patients who have more severe disease and, therefore, higher sweat chloride levels at baseline. And SKYLINE 103 included FF and other responsive mutations with lower baseline sweat chloride levels.', 'Next, the second key secondary endpoint of proportion of sweat chloride, less than 60 millimoles pooled across two studies. Eighty-six percent of patients in the vanza-treated groups and 77% of patients in the TRIKAFTA-treated groups achieved sweat chloride levels below 60 millimoles, leading to an odds ratio of 2.21 and a P value of 0.0001. This means about two times greater likelihood in the odds of achieving sweat chloride less than 60 with Vanza versus TRIKAFTA. Last, the third key secondary endpoint of proportion of sweat chloride, less than 30 millimoles, pooled across the two studies.', 'Thirty-one percent of patients in the vanza-treated groups versus 23% of patients in the TRIKAFTA treated groups achieved sweat chloride levels below 30 millimoles, leading to an odds ratio of 2.87 and a P value of 0.0001. This means about three times greater likelihood in the odds of achieving sweat chloride less than 30 with vanzacaftor versus TRIKAFTA. The results were even more pronounced in the RIDGELINE study, evaluating children ages 6 to 11. The primary endpoint in this single-arm study was safety, which I will come to in a minute.', 'On efficacy, 95% of patients achieved sweat chloride below 60 millimoles, the diagnostic threshold for cystic fibrosis. And more than half reached sweat chloride levels below the carrier level threshold of 30 millimoles. These sweat chloride results with the vanza triple are both impressive and important. Let me take a step back to frame the significance of these results.', 'While CF is a systemic, multi-organ disease, historically, the focus has been primarily on lung function as measured by ppFEV1, given it is the most visible symptom and typically the cause of death in CF patients. ppFEV1 is also the regulatory enabling endpoint. Given the strides we have made with TRIKAFTA, we believe we may have reached the maximum potential benefit in lung function from CFTR modulators. Thus, our objective with vanzacaftor moves beyond the focus on lung function to a broader, more ambitious goal to improve CFTR protein function as measured by lower sweat chloride levels and deliver even greater systemic benefit than TRIKAFTA.', 'To be clear, the goal with the vanza of Pivotal Development Program was to show the lung function benefit was noninferior to TRIKAFTA and, over and above that, to deliver additional benefit on sweat chloride, the direct marker of CFTR protein function. A note on CFTR protein, CFTR protein dysfunction is the underlying pathophysiology in CF. And while CF is often diagnosed by a genetic test at birth, it is confirmed via a sweat chloride test because it is the direct measure of CFTR protein dysfunction. Simply put, higher levels of sweat chloride associated with more severe disease.', ""Therefore, the ultimate goal is to restore CFTR protein function as measured by sweat chloride, back to normal or as close to normal as possible, so that there is no manifestation of disease. And more specifically, sweat chloride values below 60 millimoles are associated with improved outcomes such, as better and more stable lung function, fewer pulmonary exacerbations, better quality of life, and improved survival. Vertex's ultimate treatment goal is to restore sweat chloride levels to below 30, which is considered normal and are typical of CF carriers who do not have the disease, for instance, the parents of children with CF. Thus, our goal in designing the vanza after triple therapy studies was to test if even more patients treated with vanza could achieve those sweat chloride thresholds of less than 60 and less than 30 than those treated with TRIKAFTA."", 'Switching to safety, the vanza triple was generally safe and well tolerated in all three studies. The adverse events seen in the vanza triple pivotal development program are consistent with the underlying disease and with the incidence and nature of adverse events we have seen with previous CFTR modulators. As a reminder and to round out the profile of the vanzacaftor triple, this therapy offers the convenience of once-daily dosing for patients and a substantially lower royalty burden. In summary, we set a goal to establish a new and higher bar in the treatment of CF with CFTR modulators.', 'And with these phase 3 vanza triple results, we have the first evidence that we have done so. And with these results, we now know that the vanza triple has indeed surpassed the very high bar set by TRIKAFTA in people with CF ages 6 and older. And by treating patients early with the vanza triple, we have the potential to possibly prevent systemic manifestations of CF in more people. These results also reaffirm our conviction that continued investment in scientific and serial innovation will allow us to complete our journey to transform CF by bringing all eligible CF patients down to carrier levels of sweat chloride where there are no manifestations of disease.', 'I want to acknowledge the CF patients in our clinical trials who put their trust in U.S., as well as the Vertex San Diego team and the CF R&D teams, some of whom have worked on CF for more than 20 years to deliver yet another potentially transformative medicine. We are working rapidly to compile the regulatory submissions and anticipate filing in both the U.S. and Europe for patients ages 6 and older by the middle of 2024. We will be using one of our priority review vouchers entitling us to designate the vanza NDA for priority review, which provides an expedited six-month review versus a standard 10-month review timeline.', ""I'll close on CF with VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients who do not make any CFTR protein and therefore cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Late last year, we completed enrollment and dosing in the single ascending dose portion of our study for VX-522 and initiated the multiple ascending dose portion of the study. This study continues to screen and roll in dosed patients, and we expect data late this year or early next. Turning now to CASGEVY, our precise, durable CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing therapy that delivers a potential one-time functional cure for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia."", 'CASGEVY represents an enormous advancement for the estimated 35,000 people living with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia across the U.S. and Europe, as well as thousands of patients in other regions such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. CASGEVY represents a significant commercial opportunity as well. And Stuart will discuss the strong start to the launch following the rapid approvals in multiple countries.', 'While these launches are underway, we are awaiting approval in the E.U., where CASGEVY has received CHMP positive opinion for both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. CASGEVY is also under review in Switzerland, and we anticipate filing in Canada this quarter. Lastly, on CASGEVY, recognizing the importance of treating patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia early in life to minimize organ damage and other complications of the disease, we are conducting studies in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia to expand the label to younger age groups. To that end, we recently completed enrollment in our two global phase 3 studies in patients 5 to 11 years of age, and dosing in these studies is underway.', 'Moving to the pain program and VX-548, our novel highly selective NaV 1.8 pain signal inhibitor. With VX-548, we finally have the possibility of a medicine that has the compelling combination of both strong efficacy and strong safety that can be used for multiple moderate to severe pain types across multiple settings of care. Last week, we detailed the positive results from the three phase 3 trials that comprise our pivotal program for VX-548 in acute pain, including randomized placebo-controlled trials in two different pain models: abdominoplasty, a soft tissue pain model; and bunionectomy, a heart tissue pain model; and a single-arm safety and effectiveness trial in a broad range of surgical and nonsurgical pain conditions. Both the abdominoplasty and bunionectomy RCTs met the primary endpoint with statistically significant improvement in pain compared to placebo on the primary endpoint of SPID48.', 'The SPID48 is derived from a change in the numeric pain rating scale, or NPS. Practicing physicians tell us that in addition to SPID48, they focus on this reduction in the NPS from baseline. And this change in baseline in NPRS score is also how clinical meaningfulness is assessed in the field. In acute post-operative pain studies, clinical meaningfulness is defined by at least a two-point change in NPRS from baseline, or at least a 30% reduction in NPRS from baseline.', 'In that context, both RCTs demonstrated that treatment with VX-548 led to rapid clinically meaningful reductions on the NPRS with more than three points of pain reduction or roughly a 50% reduction from baseline in the VX-548 arms. The single-arm safety and effectiveness trial was conducted in a broad range of surgical and nonsurgical pain conditions and supported longer-term safety and effectiveness. VX-548 was safe and well-tolerated across all three studies, including multiple acute pain types and settings of importance. With respect to safety, in the two RCTs, the incidence of adverse events in the VX-548 arms was lower than placebo, an uncommon and noteworthy finding.', 'We believe the results of this comprehensive phase 3 program support a broad moderate to severe acute pain label and, if approved, should enable prescribing and usage across multiple care settings. VX-548 has already secured fast-track and breakthrough designations, and we are working with urgency to file the NDA by mid 2024. Moving now to neuropathic pain. Two months ago, we also reported positive results from our phase 2 study of VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, one type of peripheral neuropathy pain, and another area of high unmet need.', 'We look forward to our end of phase 2 meeting with the FDA toward the end of this quarter and starting our phase 3 program thereafter. We also continue to enroll on dose our second phase 2 neuropathic pain study of VX-548 in lumbosacral ridiculous radiculopathy, or LSR. Ultimately, we seek a broad neuropathic pain label and believe by studying two of the largest pain segments, DPN and LSR, which, together, represent more than 60% of all peripheral neuropathy pain, we have a pathway to that broad indication. Just as we transform the treatment of CF.', 'We believe we have the potential to transform the treatment of pain, both acute and neuropathic, based on the compelling and consistent results we have seen with VX-548. We now have results in hand from the phase 3 program in acute pain, as well as the phase 2 results in DPN. We are underway with the phase 2 study in LSR, and we are continuing to execute our portfolio approach of serial innovation. We are well on our way to helping address the unmet need of 90 million patients suffering with pain.', ""With that, I'll now turn it over to Stuart."", 'Stuart Arbuckle -- Chief Operating Officer', 'Thanks, Reshma. With the recent approvals of CASGEVY in sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia in multiple countries and the recent positive results in our pivotal trials for VX-548 in acute pain and for the vanzacaftor triple combination in CF, We are well and truly entering a new era of commercial diversification. As Reshma noted, we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year commercial results in CF as we continue to grow the number of eligible patients receiving our CFRT modulators. Fourth quarter U.S.', 'growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA, including in patients ages 2 to 5 years old following the approval for these patients in April. Outside the U.S., we saw continued growth from both label expansions and new reimbursement agreements. In the near term, we will continue to focus on reaching more eligible patients, including younger age groups, which will provide revenue growth. And then, we expect to drive further growth with the vanzacaftor triple combination.', 'Given the positive phase 3 data we released today that demonstrates a strong benefit risk profile and the ability to deliver greater restoration of CFTR function than even TRIKAFTA, we believe the vanzacaftor triple combination will be widely welcomed by the CF community, both as a new treatment option for the greater than 6000 patients who have discontinued one of our current CFTR modulators, and as an opportunity for TRIKAFTA patients to achieve even greater levels of CFTR function. Longer term, we see additional growth from our mRNA program VX-522 that we are developing in partnership with Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients with mutations that do not respond to CFTR modulators. In addition, we recently updated our estimate of the number of people living with CF in North America, Europe, and Australia to 92,000 from the previous estimate of 88,000. This increase is in large part due to patients living longer as a result of improvements in CF care, including the advent of CFTR modulators.', 'We expect this trend to continue based on the real world evidence we have generated on the clinical benefits of CFTR modulators. And this will also drive long-term growth. Now, turning to CASGEVY and our launches in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Enthusiasm from patients, physicians, and payers is very high around the globe, and we are focused on translating the scientific and medical innovation that CASGEVY represents into transformative patient benefit in the real world.', 'In countries where CASGEVY has been approved, our sales, reimbursement and access teams, as well as patient engagement teams have hit the ground running. Let me provide some insights on the early days of the launch. Starting with physicians. There is tremendous interest in CASGEVY and what it can do for their patients, and we see the impact of that in the rapid activation of authorized treatment centers.', 'Less than two months post-approval, we already have 12 ADCs in the U.S. and three in the E.U. and one in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, all ready to receive patients. Reaction from payers has also been very positive.', 'In the U.S. across commercial and government payers, all eligible CASGEVY patients have case-by-case coverage through single case agreements. We continue to see excellent progress from payers on the development of their formal medical policies and reimbursement pathways. We have a contract in place with synergy for up to 100 million lives and are actively engaged with other commercial payers to finalize medical policies, which would bring the total percentage of covered lives to over 80%.', 'In the government sector, Medicaid state agencies representing over 60% of sickle cell disease lives have established reimbursement pathways for CASGEVY with an additional 25% of Medicaid sickle cell disease lives in states actively progressing their reimbursement methodologies. In addition, we were pleased to have received the January approval in the U.S. for CASGEVY for transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients two and a half months early and are working to achieve a similarly fast trajectory for gaining reimbursement and access for these patients. Last week, there was an important update by the Biden administration on the CMMI cell and gene therapy access demonstration model that was originally announced in February of 2023 and was recently accelerated for implementation from 2026 to 2025.', ""We believe the CMMI CGT access model could be an important additional path to access, and we now have greater clarity on the scope and process to be employed in the model. The model is intended to provide a comprehensive strategy to address barriers to equitable access to cell and gene therapies for Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as the long-standing inequities of care in the sickle cell disease community. Last week's update also confirmed additional federal funding to support access and included a defined scope of manufacturer-provided fertility support in the model. In recognition that for patients choosing to embark on the treatment journey, the costs of fertility preservation are a barrier to access."", 'In the meantime, we continue to actively engage with state Medicaid agencies to finalize medical policies for CASGEVY even in advance of the CGT access model to ensure patient access without delay. Outside the U.S., we are pleased that the French National Authority for Health has approved our request for the implementation of an early access program, or EAP, for patients ages 12 to 35 years. We are delighted to have secured a path to access and payment in France, ahead of a national reimbursement agreement, and are also in an EAP review process for sickle cell disease patients. In the U.K., CASGEVY will be reviewed by the highly specialized technology committee in February.', ""And we are advancing our reimbursement discussions in other European countries as well. We also see strong progress in the Middle East, which is especially important for CASGEVY given the high prevalence of these diseases in the region and the government's clear focus on elevating the health of their citizens. We are working with local healthcare authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to refine our estimates of the exact number of eligible patients. But there are thousands of patients we could serve, and we are focused on securing access and reimbursement for them."", 'We have established a local presence in the region, have already activated our first ATC, and are working with local healthcare professionals to expand the number of ATCs and establish the required infrastructure to meet patient demand. As we have previously outlined, the CASGEVY patient journey can be broken down into three key phases, each of which can take several months: pretreatment, cell collection and manufacturing, and then infusion of the edited cells. We are pleased with the early days of what will be a foundational year for CASGEVY as we work to deliver transformative patient outcomes with the possibility of a lifetime of benefit. We look forward to updating you on the CASGEVY launch over the course of this year.', 'To help track our progress, our expectation is to provide quarterly updates on the number of activated ATCs, as well as the number of patients in the cell collection phase. ATCs have begun assessing their patients for the ability to be treated with CASGEVY, and we expect that the first commercial patients will start the journey in the coming weeks. Shifting now to VX-548. We are very excited about the potential for this highly selective NaV 1.8 inhibitor to provide a transformative treatment option for the millions of patients suffering from acute and peripheral neuropathic pain.', ""This quarter, I'll limit my comments to acute pain. As we discussed last week when we shared the results from the pivotal program, we are very excited about VX-548's compelling combination of efficacy and safety and the demonstration that it can be used for moderate to severe pain across a range of pain conditions, both surgical and nonsurgical, and across a range of settings. If approved, VX-548 will be the first of a new class of medicines that inhibit the pain signal and represent the first new class of medicines for acute pain in over 20 years. The reason we're so excited about the potential for VX-548 to positively impact patient care is because we estimate approximately 80 million patients are prescribed a medicine for moderate to severe acute pain every year in the U.S., representing over 1 billion calendar days of treatment."", 'Given this massive patient population, acute pain is a multi-billion dollar market today, despite the fact that essentially all prescriptions are generic. We also see upside to this market opportunity, given the significant unmet need that stems from the suboptimal benefit risk profiles of existing agents, such as the limited efficacy but acceptable side effects of NSAIDs, or the adverse effects and addiction potential of opioids. All of which leads to suboptimal pain management. What physicians and patients seek is a medicine that combines effective relief of moderate to severe pain with a clear safety and tolerability profile, and VX-548 delivers on that profile.', ""We've previously shared our go-to-market strategy and we are now actively recruiting our field force in anticipation of our regulatory filing and approval. The commercial team will focus on the roughly 2,000 hospitals and institutions where a majority of acute pain patients are seen and prescriptions are written. We continue to see a multibillion dollar opportunity for VX-548 in acute pain alone. The well known risks of opioids have led to widespread restrictions and limitations on their use over the years."", 'Increasingly, we are seeing a paradigm shift in policy initiatives across various stakeholders to encourage consideration and use of nonopioid alternatives and to remove financial barriers to choosing a branded nonopioid. As an example, late last month, Congress introduced the bipartisan Alternatives to Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act, or the Alternatives to PAIN Act. If enacted, Medicare Part D plans would be required to set copays for nonopioids, like the VX-548, in line with copays for generic opioids, which are typically between 0 and $15. The bill would also prohibit Medicare Part D plans from requiring seniors to step through opioids first or requiring prior authorization for nonopioids.', 'In addition, the NOPAIN Act, or Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act, which was enacted in late 2022, provides for an add-on payment for nonopioids in the outpatient and ambulatory surgery center settings and remains on track to go into effect in 2025. And just recently, seven states, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia, have pending legislation that would require education on nonopioid options and would remove financial barriers to patient access within state-based health insurance programs like Medicaid. We expect additional states to introduce similar legislation later this year. We believe that these advances in federal and state legislation represent further momentum in Congress and across the U.S.', ""to encourage adoption of and remove any financial barriers to using nonopioid therapies like the VX-548. In conclusion, it's an incredibly exciting time at Vertex. We continue to treat more CF patients around the world and with the vanza triple now have visibility to provide an option for the patients who have discontinued CFTR modulators, as well as the possibility to bring even more patients below diagnostic levels, and even to carry a levels Of sweat chloride. We're entering a new era of commercial diversification with the launch of CASGEVY, the first-ever gene edited therapy that brings a potential functional cure to patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia across multiple regions."", ""And we are preparing for additional near-term launches with significant market potential, including VX-548 in acute pain. I'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials."", 'Charlie Wagner -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Stuart. Vertex's excellent results in the fourth quarter of 2023 demonstrate once again our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. Fourth quarter 2023 revenue increased 9% year over year to 2.52 billion and was nicely balanced with revenue growth of 8% in the U.S. and 12% outside the U.S."", ""Full year revenue of 9.87 billion represents 11% growth versus 2022, our ninth consecutive year of at least double-digit growth. Overall, the primary drivers of revenue growth in 2023 were in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IPR&D, and SG&A expenses were 1 billion compared to $872 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Included in Q4 '23 results are 18 million of acquired IPR&D charges compared to 23 million of such charges in the fourth quarter of 2022."", 'Note that with the approval of CASGEVY in the fourth quarter, cost for manufacturing capacity for CASGEVY are now being recorded in cost of goods sold rather than in R&D. Full year 2023 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IPR&D, and SG&A expenses were 4.24 billion compared to 3.07 billion in 2022. Fourth quarter and full year operating expense growth was driven as expected by continued investment in research and our pipeline as we have now advanced assets into the clinic in nine different disease areas. In the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, the most significant areas of increased investment versus prior year included the pivotal studies for VX-548 in acute pain and the vanzacaftor triple in CF, the phase 1/2 study for type 1 diabetes, as well as the buildout of capabilities for both our expanding pipeline and our anticipated near-term commercial launches.', 'In addition, approximately 400 million of the year-over-year increase in operating expenses was the result of increased AIPR&D costs from new business development. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income was 1.15 billion, consistent with 1.15 billion in non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 non-GAAP operating income was 4.37 billion compared to 4.79 billion in 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 effective tax rate of 16.3% reflects an increase in our 2023 U.S.', 'R&D tax credits. This benefit lowered the Q4 rate and brought the full year 2023 effective tax rate to 19.4%, slightly below our guidance range of 20% to 21%. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.20, representing 12% growth compared to $3.76 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share were $15.23 compared to $14.88 in 2022.', 'We ended the quarter with $13.7 billion in cash and investments. Our priorities for cash deployment remain unchanged as we continue to prioritize investment in innovation, including external innovation, via business development. During 2023, we completed 10 transactions and recognized over $500 million of AIPR&D. We also deployed over $400 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares over the course of 2023.', 'Now, switching to guidance. For 2024, we expect total product revenue in a range of 10.55 billion to 10.75 billion, representing revenue growth of 8% at the midpoint at current exchange rates. Included in this outlook is our expectation for continued growth in CF as we continue to reach more patients, including younger ones, in core markets and select other countries. Guidance also includes contribution from the commercial launch of CASGEVY and approved indications and geographies.', 'We continue to expect a foundational year for CASGEVY in 2024 as we ramp up patient initiations and build toward a multibillion dollar market opportunity over time. We are providing total product revenue guidance rather than specifics by disease area or product, given the inherent uncertainty of new launches, as well as the significant disparity in size of our established CF business relative to other revenues. As a reminder, on the accounting for CASGEVY and the CRISPR profit share arrangement, Vertex will book 100% of revenues for CASGEVY. The profit share with CRISPR, calculated after product and commercial costs, will be recorded in cost of goods sold.', 'Any ongoing research and development costs will be recorded in operating expenses, net of CRISPR share. For total Vertex operating expenses, we project 4.3 to 4.4 billion in full year 2024 combined non-GAAP, SG&A, R&D, and acquired IPR&D. This operating expense range includes approximately 125 million in currently anticipated IPR&D charges. We continue to invest a majority of our operating expenses into R&D, given the momentum in our multiple mid and late-stage clinical development programs.', ""Note that the costs for multiple phase 3 studies have been a significant driver of our growth in our total operating expenses in recent years. Given that a number of phase 3 studies were completed as we entered 2024, we were able to fund new additional phase 3 studies without the same rate of growth in operating expenses. While we have substantially completed our commercial investments for CASGEVY, we're also funding the expansion of our commercial capabilities in anticipation of other multi-billion dollar opportunities represented by our programs with near-term launch potential, while continuing to leverage an attractive business model afforded by our focus in specialty markets. With a more normalized impact from U.S."", 'R&D tax credits in 2024, our full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. In closing, Vertex delivered excellent results yet again in 2023, achieving strong revenue growth, important regulatory approvals and commercial launches, and positive pivotal trial results that will enable additional near-term launches. We also made progress in our earlier-stage pipeline with proof of concept for VX-548 in neuropathic pain and anticipated advancement of two additional disease areas into the clinic. We also made substantial investments behind our programs and commercial capabilities for near-term launches.', ""As we head into 2024, we anticipate further important milestones as highlighted on Slide 20 to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls, and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&A period."", 'Susie Lisa -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations', ""Thanks, Charlie. Just a note, given the multiple positive updates this quarter and thus the longer duration of our prepared remarks, we'll plan to go to about 5:40 this evening to allow 30 minutes for your questions. Chuck, please go ahead and assemble the queue."", '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] And the first question will come from Ms. Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Salveen Richter -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the data. Two questions for me.', ""One is with regard to the initial patient you'll be targeting with the next-generation CF program, could you just elaborate whether it's switch patients or patients who have discontinued naive patients here and where you anticipate the most demand? And then, secondly, on the CASGEVY launch, in light of the innovation cell and gene therapy access demonstration model, how do you work that into the launch at this point? And is there an overhang if you have to determine how these outcome-based agreements may play out? Thank you."", 'Reshma Kewalramani -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. Thanks, Salveen. Let me turn it over to Stuart for both the question on vanza commercialization and on the CASGEVY launch with a focus on the CMMI question.', 'Stuart Arbuckle -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Yes, Salveen, so in answer to your first question on vanzacaftor, the answer's both. I think vanzacaftor is going to be an attractive treatment option, both for patients who are currently being treated, who might want superior control of their CFTR function because both patients and physicians know that CFTR function and dysfunction is the underlying cause of CF. And so, if you can further improve CFTR function, you're going to get better clinical outcomes down the line. So, I think we're going to see interest from those who are currently being treated."", ""But I also think we're going to see a lot of interest from patients who previously discontinued one of our CFTR modulators, given the profile that we've demonstrated today. And then, on CASGEVY, a couple of comments, really. The first one I would make is we're very excited about the demo and the opportunity to work with CMS for those states who are interested in working with CMS and are interested in outcomes-based agreements. I don't particularly see that being a delay for a couple of reasons."", ""One, we're already working with many state Medicaid agencies. We're not waiting for the demo before we secure access for patients who are covered by Medicaid. And then, secondly, in terms of do I think it's going to be complex and be a delay to negotiate outcome-based agreements, I don't, really. If you look at the profile of CASGEVY, it is so incredibly strong that, really, we're talking about an outcomes-based agreement, which is looking at whether a very, very small number of patients may not respond."", ""And so, I don't think it's an outcome-based agreement where there's lots of uncertainty and difficulty with the outcomes and metrics and endpoints. And so, I don't expect that to be particularly challenging."", 'Salveen Richter -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Geoff Meacham -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question, and congrats on the data. On vanza, I just have a couple of questions. Can you follow SKYLINE or RIDGELINE in an extension? I'm just trying to think if you can pick up more differentiation versus TRIKAFTA just in terms of maybe exacerbations or measuring pancreatic sufficiency over a longer period."", ""I guess, ultimately, where I'm going is that, you know, sweat chloride isn't regularly used in the clinic for treatment decisions, so I'm trying to see rationale for maybe switching a patient away from TRIKAFTA if they're stable. Thank you."", 'Reshma Kewalramani -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Hey, thanks, Geoff. This is Reshma. Let me take that one.', ""When we think about the patients who were enrolled in both the SKYLINE trial, so the 12-year-olds and above and the RIDGELINE patients, 6 to 11, there are already extension studies, so those patients have the opportunity to roll over into open-label extension studies just like we did with TRIKAFTA. And I do suspect you're right about the ability to evaluate and document the overall improvements in patients with CF lives over time. And just to give you a sense for what I'm looking at and why I say that, if you look in the safety tables that were one of the slides, unsurprisingly, the most common -- or one of the most common AEs in this patient population is pulmonary exacerbation. And if you look, there are less pulmonary exacerbations numerically in those safety tables in the patients on vanza than on the patients who are on TRIKAFTA."", ""And TRIKAFTA is an amazing drug that has already documented improvements in pulmonary exacerbation and other longer-term outcomes. So, I do think you're very correct that we'll be able to pick up these long-term outcomes as these patients are followed in the open-label extension studies and then as they are followed in registries. And we are very fortunate in CF that the registries already exist and the vast majority of patients with cystic fibrosis are followed in registries."", 'Geoff Meacham -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Mohit Bansal -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Great, thank you very much for taking my question. Just following up on Geoff's question, so how commonly doctors check sweat chloride levels as part of -- I know it is for diagnostic purposes, but do they check it for -- retest it for prescribing as well? Or is it something that you'll have to educate these doctors on that? And then, my follow-up is actually on the COGS for Charlie, cost of goods sold. As you think about 2024, what happened in the fourth quarter, was it one-time movement from R&D to COGS, which drove it? Or is it something that we need to continue modeling going forward? Thank you."", 'Reshma Kewalramani -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey. Hi, Mohit. Let me ask Charlie to tackle the COGS question first, and I'll come back and tell you about sweat chloride in clinical practice."", 'Charlie Wagner -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah, Mohit, in the fourth quarter, because CASGEVY was approved in the U.S., we started treating it as a commercial product, and, therefore, we took some of the manufacturing costs that previously had been recorded in R&D and moved them up to cost of goods sold. Those manufacturing costs will remain in cost of goods sold going forward.', 'Reshma Kewalramani -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Mohit, with regard to sweat chloride measurement in clinical practice, you're very correct. In terms of diagnosis, patients in the Western world are diagnosed by a gene test, a genetic test, oftentimes, when patients are born or when people are born. And then, that's confirmed with a sweat chloride test. If the number is above 60, that's a diagnosis of CF."", ""If it's between 30 and 60 millimoles for sweat chloride, that's indeterminate. If it's less than 30, that is not diagnosed as CF. This is not a metric. Sweat chloride is not a measure that's followed routinely in clinical practice."", ""But what physicians understand very well, especially pulmonologists who are CF experts, is that the underlying cause of disease in CF is dysfunction of the CFTR protein. That's very well understood. And further, that a direct readout of that CFTR protein function is sweat chloride. So, I think the concepts are very well understood."", 'But sweat chloride, other than the diagnosis, is not a commonly used test in the clinic.', 'Mohit Bansal -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Got it.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Phil Nadeau with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'Phil Nadeau -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Good afternoon. Let us add our congratulations on another positive pivotal program. One on sweat chloride and then one actually on the pain data that you released last week. First, on the sweat chloride, it does look like TRIKAFTA gets a decent proportion of patients to below 60 millimoles per liter and below 30 millimoles per liter.', ""Do you have data following the patients who have been on TRIKAFTA for a long time to show better outcomes for those TRIKAFTA patients who got to low levels of sweat chloride, which then, presumably, you could extrapolate to vanza triple and show a higher proportion of patients would have good outcomes? That's the first question. And then, the second question, on the pain data released last week, it does seem like the bunionectomy phase 3 trial underperformed the phase 2 that you had previously released, as well as the abdominoplasty phase 3 released last week. Was there anything different about that trial which would have caused 548 to act less potently than it had in the prior studies. Thanks."", 'Reshma Kewalramani -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, Phil, let me take bunionectomy, abdominoplasty, VX-548 first, and then we'll come back to the sweat chloride. You know what I actually find remarkable, Phil, is the -- how consistently 548 has performed. That to me is more striking than the smaller differences in bunionectomy readout phase 2 to phase 3, or across from bunionectomy to abdominoplasty. So, if I look at the totality of the VX-548 evidence, and it's easy enough to do because the structure of the study design was very similar in phase 2 as phase 3, and we have the same dose, the high dose from phase 2, you'll see that bunionectomy and abdominoplasty performed virtually identically."", 'Like the SPID48 was something like 40 points or something like that. I think that was the actual number. And then, when you move to phase 3, again, positive studies against placebo. In the grand scheme of things, this is remarkable because, as you know, the conduct of clinical trials in the pain field is notoriously difficult.', ""Placebo effects move around significantly. The effect of any comparator group moves around significantly. So, when I look at the totality of the data, and for me, that means looking at the data from phase 2 to phase 3, and it also means looking at the SPID48, let's focus on bunionectomy, in bunionectomy, and connecting that with the NPRS. Remember the NPRS is the actual score that feeds the SPID48, which is an integration of NPRS over time."", ""So, if you look at the NPRS data, the decrease in the NPRS is 3.4 points in bunionectomy. It's 3.4 points in abdominoplasty start to hour 48. And it's about a 50% decrease in terms of the relative decrease. And when you look at that in comparison to NORCO, the opioid we use in the trial, that number is 3.2 in abdominoplasty, 3.6."", ""in bunionectomy, and it's approximately a 50% reduction in terms of the relative change. So, I put that all together, and I see quite a bit of consistency and very good therapeutic effectiveness and efficacy. On sweat chloride, so it's a really, really great question. And in order to sort of really understand this, you have to triangulate a couple of different data points."", 'One data point is around just the natural history and the genetics of this disease. So, take, for example, patients who are FMF versus those who are FRF. FMF patients have very high sweat chloride and have more severe disease. FRF patients, the residual function patients, have relatively better sweat chloride levels and relatively less severe disease.', ""That's one set of data. And then, to your point, if you look at interventional data, the data that we have the greatest reduction in ppFEV1, sweat chloride, and long-term evidence is TRIKAFTA. And if you compare that to KALYDECO, for example, you can see where TRIKAFTA does even better than KALYDECO. And the best example I can give you is on rate of decline."", ""The TRIKAFTA real-world data on rate of decline shows there is no decline. And until we got to TRIKAFTA, what we could show is we slowed the rate of decline. And so, I have every reason in the world to believe as the vanzacaftor triple is used over a longer time point and we get CFTR protein function to higher levels and the vanza triple has given us the best, highest-achieved CFTR protein levels, I do think we're going to see long-term benefit. And, yes, you can do all of that math and triangulation from the available data."", 'Phil Nadeau -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Perfect. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Please go ahead.', 'Robyn Karnauskas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""Hi. Thank you. So, commercialization, I know it's really hard switching from one drug to the next. Can you walk me through switching from TRIKAFTA to the next drug? And like, given that people are stable, their lung functions are great."", ""How would you think about what motivates commercial, Europe, as well as U.S. to allow people to stay on drug and like move to a next-generation drug? And I think I'm coming from the point of like, I remember from a long time ago, the people had a hard time switching from one drug to the other. And I want to understand like more like how you actually help people, help commercial organizations switch from one to the next."", 'Reshma Kewalramani -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Stuart?', 'Stuart Arbuckle -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Yeah, Robyn, thanks. So, I must confess, our experience is a little bit different to that. We've seen very rapid transitions from our medicines as we've serially innovated and delivered better and better medicines and even, for instance, when we introduced TRIKAFTA and patients who had been on KALYDECO for instance for a very long time, and, obviously, Kalydeco had set a very high bar for efficacy, we did see rapid adoption with TRIKAFTA even in those patients, given that it had a clear benefit risk profile. So, I think we've seen relatively rapid transitions for our medicines as we've serially innovated."", ""And interestingly, the design of the study actually gives a proof for the fact that patients can effectively transition from TRIKAFTA to vanzacaftor because, as Reshma mentioned in her remarks, the design of the study was to have people stable on four weeks of TRIKAFTA therapy to establish a baseline and they were then randomized to either continue on TRIKAFTA or transition to vanzacaftor. So, we have, within the study, real-world evidence of people being able to transition. And then, you'll ask me, what do I think is going to motivate people to want to consider the vanzacaftor triple combination? I think it's the benefit risk profile that we've been able to demonstrate here with achieving higher levels of sweat chloride reduction than with any of our previous medicines, including now TRIKAFTA, and the fact that this is a once-a-day therapy. So, as I've said a number of times, I think with this profile, we're going to see a lot of enthusiasm from the CF community."", 'Robyn Karnauskas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""So, follow-up question for you, what about the pairs of the government in Europe? Do they believe in like, you've had very stable levels of lung function with TRIKAFTA. Do you think that people focus on like that? Or do they need more data going forward?"", 'Stuart Arbuckle -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Well, I mean, I think we've had a long track of working with payers on cystic fibrosis for, again, well over a decade now. So, I think there's a significant amount of understanding about the disease. Obviously, we'll be presenting the data to vanzacaftor to payers in a compliant manner at the right time. The one other thing I would note about the vanzacaftor triple combination is it's likely to be indicated for a very similar population of patients to TRIKAFTA, which I do think is going to make this launch, from a payer perspective, a bit different to previous launches, as you will recall, because you've been on this journey with us for a while."", ""When we launched ORKAMBI, we were moving from kind of single-digit numbers of eligible patients to a medicine that could potentially treat up to 50% of CF patients. When we then brought TRIKAFTA forward, we were moving it toward being able to treat 90% of patients. Vanza is going to likely have a very similar label to TRIKAFTA, and so it's not likely to be as scary, I would suggest, to payers in terms of a big budget impact hit."", 'Robyn Karnauskas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.

You then have to go through the cell [Technical difficulty] manufacturing process. And then, the cells are infused. Each of those steps can take a number of months."", ""And as you know, we've said that we'll be recognizing revenue at the point of infusion. So, in contrast to our cystic fibrosis launches, which have really seen incredibly rapid uptake, we have said that we are expecting this launch to be more like a traditional biopharma launch. But we are expecting this -- and we have said we are expecting this to be a foundational year for us as we build momentum around CASGEVY.

I know there's a lot on the vanza triple, but kind of can you maybe walk us through some of the clinical considerations as you would get to maybe have a physician switch patient?

And I guess maybe, more specifically, why would a patient discontinue TRIKAFTA, and why would they want to reinitiate with the vanza triple? Thank you."", 'Reshma Kewalramani -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure thing, Evan. I think Stuart has talked about this. And maybe I'll shorthand it by saying we have the approximately 6,000 patients who are in the system. They are known to have CF."", ""They are seen by a CF provider. They used to be on TRIKAFTA, so they're not lost. They simply have discontinued it, either because of an adverse event or, perhaps, because of compliance [Technical difficulty] vanza, of course, once a day. So, we see those 6,000 patients potentially coming back."", ""And the short version of the conversation would be they're coming to see their doctor. Usually CF patients are seen by their doctor once a quarter. So, when they return, the conversation might be something like if and when vanza approved, there's a new drug. It has this safety, it has this efficacy, do you want to try it? You had tried a medicine before."", ""This is a new one. And the doctor and patient would have a communication about that. For the patients who are already on TRIKAFTA and are doing well, I suspect it's going to be just like it was from SYMDEKO and ORKAMBI to TRIKAFTA, or from KALYDECO to TRIKAFTA. Our CF patients are very educated patients."", 'They know what clinical trials are going on. They know what potential medicines might be coming down the pike.

Just curious, as you activate these ATCs, maybe talk about transplant capacity. Does this factor into the discussions as you're activating these sites? And then, maybe on vanzacaftor, I know you guys have described the royalty differential."", ""I think, you know, TRIKAFTA is in the low double digits, and you've described vanzacaftor as down in the single digits.

And then, as Reshma said, the reaction we've had from payers has been really positive. I think they're incredibly impressed with the clinical data."", ""They are well aware of the unmet need in sickle cell disease and indeed transfusion-dependent thalassemia and the burden that places on patients and, indeed, the healthcare system.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at Waste Management's (NYSE:WM) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Waste Management:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.13 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$32b - US$4.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Waste Management has an ROCE of 13%.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 13% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 42% in that time. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders."", 'The main thing to remember is that Waste Management has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 108% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.', ""Waste Management does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Waste Management  that you might be interested in."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.46%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Waste Management will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Waste Management would post earnings of $1.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.63, delivering a surprise of +1.24%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Waste Management appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

But cheap car insurance is out there, and there are ways to lower your costs, like bundling coverage, improving your credit and maximizing discounts. You can also collect multiple auto insurance quotes and compare average rates to find which is cheapest for you.', 'Below is our guide to help you learn how to get lower rates. After all, the last thing you want to do is let your policy lapse and go without car insurance.', ""Before you can accurately start shopping for affordable auto insurance, take stock of how much car insurance you need. If you're looking to lower your minimum coverage, make sure you're aware of your needs. You can then compare your current coverage and see if what you have aligns with your needs."", 'Are you paying for more coverage than you need? Or are you underinsured to the point where you might be financially vulnerable in the event of an accident?', ""As a policyholder, it’s important to have a clear understanding of the different types of auto insurance and the amount of each type of coverage you need for your situation. For example, if you're financing or leasing a car, you may be required to carry extra coverage. High-risk drivers can expect to face additional requirements. You can find all this information with free car insurance quotes."", 'Here are some common insurance options:', 'Liability: Required in nearly every state, liability insurance covers property damage liability and bodily injury for other drivers and passengers for accidents you cause.', 'Collision: Collision coverage can help you pay to repair or replace your personal vehicle if you’re in an accident.', 'Comprehensive: Comprehensive coverage can help protect you if your vehicle is damaged in ways that don’t involve a collision. Theft, vandalism, and storm damage are examples of potential losses that comprehensive insurance may cover.', ""Personal injury protection, aka PIP: PIP helps with your medical bills (along with your passengers' medical bills) in the event of an accident."", 'Full coverage: Full coverage is an unofficial term for a car insurance policy that includes liability insurance, collision, comprehensive, and sometimes more.', ""You may also want to explore other kinds of niche coverage, including parts and equipment insurance if you've add custom features to your vehicle; emergency roadside assistance for extra peace of mind; rideshare insurance if you drive for a food delivery or car sharing app; or auto glass coverage to pay for a cracked windshield."", 'You can also examine your deductible amounts and determine whether adjusting them may be in order. (Later, when you shop around and get quotes from other insurers, these details will empower you to make sure you’re comparing apples to apples rather than getting prices for different products and different levels of coverage.)', 'Adjusting the types and amount of coverage you purchase can lower your car insurance costs overall.

Shopping around for quotes from multiple providers has the potential to reduce your auto insurance rates in a meaningful way.', 'You might get quotes for comparable policies with annual premiums that are hundreds of dollars apart. In addition to locking in an affordable rate, you want coverage with the best car insurance company for the money, meaning one with a history of doing business in your state and a record of covering claims in a timely and fair way.', 'Read more: Finding affordable car insurance for teens', 'As you’re searching for quotes from different auto insurance companies, online comparison tools can make the shopping process easier. Many insurance websites will also provide you with quotes from competitors alongside their own rates so you can see how the premiums measure up.', 'Online insurance comparison tools can save you time by eliminating the need to input your personal details over and over again. Plus, as you select the coverage options you desire, these tools ensure you’re comparing quotes for similar policies.', 'Searching for car insurance discounts that different providers offer can be another great way to save on your premiums. There are many different discount options and incentives available. Below are some of the most common.', 'Bundling discounts, also known as multi-policy discounts. You’re often rewarded with better rates when you purchase multiple policies, such as auto, life, homeowners or renters insurance, from one company.', 'Low mileage discounts', 'Defensive driving course discounts', 'Safe driver discounts for maintaining good driving habits', 'Good student discounts for young drivers who earn good grades', 'Military discounts', 'Loyalty discounts for staying with a company for several years', 'Autopay discounts', 'Security discount for installing an anti-theft device', 'Paid-in-full insurance premium discounts for paying your premium six months or a year at a time instead of monthly', 'Paperless statement discount', 'There are three main avenues for buying car insurance — direct insurers, independent agents and captive agents. Here’s what those terms mean:', 'Direct insurers: With direct insurers, you typically buy your insurance straight from the company’s website or app. There’s no intermediary between you and the insurance provider (and no separate agent to offer you personalized advice or answers either). Examples include Geico, Esurance and Progressive.', 'Captive agents: Captive insurance agents only sell the products their company offers and cannot provide you with quotes from competitors. Examples in the auto insurance space include Farmers, Nationwide, State Farm, and Farm Bureau.', 'Independent agents: Independent insurance agents work with numerous providers. As a result, they can sell products from multiple insurance companies and help you shop around for the cheapest rates and hidden discounts. Yet it’s still important to check rates on your own since insurance agents often get paid on commission and may have financial motivation to sell you certain policies over others.', 'Everyone loves to save money. But certain types of discount insurance can come with pitfalls that you’re better off avoiding.', 'For example, some discounted or cheap insurance policies may not cover permissive drivers (aka someone you gave permission to use your vehicle) or they might provide only reduced coverage. With other policies, your coverage level might drop when you drive outside of your state of residence.', ""It’s important to read the fine print of your auto policy to understand any coverage restrictions. And check out the online reviews and complaints for different insurers you’re considering. Once you've made a selection, be sure to obtain proof of insurance and ID cards — which you can either print out or save to your phone."", 'Switching your insurance provider can be a hassle; you have to consider their policies, apply, and much more. If you want to stay with your current auto insurance provider, there are ways you can save money on your current policy:', 'Ask for discounts: Watching your premiums increase for the same coverage gets old fast. Call your insurance agent or insurance company and ask if you’re eligible for any of those discounts listed above. If you’re considering changing insurers or you’ve found a lower rate with a competitor, mention that.', 'Increase your deductibles: If you have a solid emergency fund, setting a higher deductible could lower your car insurance premiums. In return, however, you’d have to pay more out of pocket for accident repairs before your coverage kicks in.', ""Adjust coverage amounts: It's a good idea to take a look once a year or so at how much car insurance you need. If you have an older vehicle that’s paid in full, you might consider reducing your coverage or even switching to liability only. But you should go this route only if you’re financially able to fix your own vehicle in an accident."", 'While premiums vary among insurers, there are some common factors that affect the car insurance quotes you receive from different providers, including the following.', 'Vehicle make and model: Certain types of cars cost more money than others to insure. As a rule, new cars and more expensive cars have higher repair costs, which will lead to higher insurance rates. If you’re considering buying a new or used vehicle, it’s wise to research the cost of insurance before you make your purchase. If you drive an electric vehicle, that can affect your rates, and classic cars require their own kind of insurance.', ""Age, gender, and marital status: Younger drivers typically pay more for auto insurance due to a lack of experience behind the wheel. Historically, men have paid more for car insurance than women because insurance companies view them as a higher risk to cover. What's more, married car insurance policyholders tend to have lower insurance premiums than their single counterparts."", 'Coverage selections and limits: The types of insurance you choose and your coverage limits have a significant impact on your car insurance rates.', 'Credit score: Your credit-based insurance score helps predict how likely you are to file an insurance claim. Good credit has the potential to save you money on your premiums, although some states limit or don’t allow insurance providers to use credit when pricing auto insurance policies.', 'Where you live: Insurers also use your ZIP code when issuing car insurance policies because where you live is associated with a particular level of risk. Areas with heavy congestion or bad road conditions can lead to increased car accidents.', 'Driving record: A clean driving record should save you money on your car insurance. On the other hand, if you have a history of speeding tickets, DUIs, at-fault accidents or other black marks, you should expect to pay higher premiums.', 'According to J.D. Power, close to one-third (31%) of auto insurance customers in the U.S. have experienced a rate increase in the past year. During that same time period, auto insurance premiums have gone up more than 20% to compensate for the record-high losses that insurers have experienced.', 'Some insurers offer loyalty discounts to discourage customers from changing providers. However, it’s still wise to review offers from competitors at least once every 12 months to confirm you’re getting the best AND cheapest car insurance coverage.', 'Read more: How to switch car insurance companies']"

Over the last year, Progressive has gained 32%. Here's why it's not too late to buy."", ""Last July, Progressive stock plummeted 13% following its second-quarter earnings announcement, its largest decline in two decades. On the surface, things weren't too bad. Net premiums were up 18%, while it turned a net profit of $345 million. However, the profitability of its insurance policies was a point of concern."", ""For insurers, the combined ratio is an important measure of profitability. This ratio takes the insurer's expenses plus claims losses divided by premiums collected.

Halfway through the year, Progressive's combined ratio was 99.7, and its 23-year streak of a ratio below 96 appeared to be in jeopardy."", 'A few factors weighed on Progressive in the first half of last year, including a flood of last-minute lawsuits in Florida and lingering impacts of inflation that increased repair and replacement costs, leading to the worst first-quarter underwriting loss for property and casualty insurers in 12 years.', ""One of Progressive's greatest strengths is its ability to underwrite profitable insurance policies consistently. From the first day it went public in 1971, Progressive's goal has been to underwrite profitable policies that earn it $4 for every $100 in premiums written. At the time, it was common practice that insurance businesses would break even on their underwriting while generating profits from their investment portfolios."", ""Progressive's focus on profitable underwriting has helped it focus on finding the customers who best fit its risk profile and adjusting premiums as necessary to account for changes in the operating environment. For example, the cost of repairs and replacement vehicles has risen dramatically. Because of Progressive's pricing power, net written premiums have increased by 52% over the past three years."", 'Progressive management adjusted to the challenging operating environment and finished 2023 in a strong way. In the fourth quarter, the company increased its net written premiums by 21% year over year while its net income was $303 million. It also accomplished a combined ratio of 88.7 and finished the year with an annual ratio of 94.9 -- its 23rd consecutive year of a 96 combined ratio or better.', 'For investors in Progressive, the fourth quarter was a good sign that the company has a handle on rising costs and has adjusted well. The company has faced challenges over the past few years, including rising interest rates and inflation, and has proven once again that it stands alone regarding underwriting profitability.', ""On a valuation basis, Progressive is a little expensive, trading at 27.3 times earnings for the year. This is slightly above its 10-year average. However, its one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio is around 17.3. The stock also trades at a premium to peers, but that's to be expected as long as it continues to achieve industry-beating profitability."", ""Progressive has an excellent track record of success, which was on full display in 2023. Its fourth-quarter earnings reaffirmed the company's position as one of the country's top insurance writers.

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\xa0isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter\xa0(see the details here).', 'Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Estée Lauder Company’s fiscal 2024 second quarter conference call. Today’s call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.', 'Rainey Mancini: Hello. On today’s call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you’ll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures, and the impact of foreign currency translation.', 'You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers’ websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. Now I’ll turn the call over to Fabrizio.', 'Fabrizio Freda: Thank you Rainey and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. For the second quarter, we delivered our outlook for organic sales decline of 8% and exceeded expectations for adjusted diluted EPS. Organic sales in our global travel retail business decreased 28% with retail sales trends better than organic performance, reflecting both the execution of our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers and efforts by various local authorities to contain structured market activity. We made meaningful progress with trade inventory levels in Asia travel retail and continue to expect to be a normalized trade inventory levels by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year. The entire rest of our global business decreased 3% organically.', 'This decline was primarily driven by the slow-down of overall prestige beauty in mainland China, although our retail sales trends were much better than our organic performance. Our global retail sales growth excluding travel retail in mainland China rose mid-single digits. The markets of EMEA delivered mid-single digit retail sales growth, and Asia-Pacific excluding mainland China rose double digits, as did Latin America, showcasing strong fundamentals for brand desirability and the success of our consumer engagement initiatives. Encouragingly, we made progress across several strategic priorities in the first half. Beyond reducing inventories of Asia travel retail, we improved working capital, realized higher levels of strategic pricing, and managed expenses with discipline.', 'For the full year, we are revising our outlook as we have tightened the growth range for organic sales primarily to account for risk of macroeconomic volatility in some areas around the world and updated adjusted diluted EPS for an anticipated higher tax rate. In this revised outlook, we have maintained our prior outlook for full year operating profitability. Looking ahead, we are at an inflection point. First, we are positioned to return organic sales growth for the total company in the third quarter, and we expect organic sales growth to sequentially accelerate in the fourth quarter. Second, we are positioned for stronger profitability in the second half of this fiscal year compared to the first half. Third, we are preparing to meaningfully accelerate the rebuild of our profitability in fiscal years 2025 and 2026.', 'Indeed, since we spoke with you in late November, our teams have been actively engaged to operationalize the profit recovery plan. In doing so, we have identified further opportunities to enhance profitability while also generating more resources to be invested in consumer-focused areas to drive long term growth. As a result, we are expanding the profit recovery plan to include a restructuring program. While this is a difficult decision, we believe this now larger plan will better position the company to restore stronger and more sustainable profitability while also supporting sales growth acceleration and increasing agility and speed to market. For the consumer, we anticipate faster product and commercial innovation supported by strategic brand-building distribution and go-to-market advancement, where digital leadership is at the core.', 'Moreover, we intend to increase our speed and agility as an organization, enabling quicker and more localized decision making to better create and respond to consumer trends. The profit recovery plan is now expected to deliver incremental operating profit of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, up from $800 million to $1 billion previously. In terms of timing, this incremental profit is anticipated to be realized in fiscal year 2025 and ’26, with more than half in fiscal year 2025. We are confident that our multiple engines of growth strategy will be enhanced by the profit recovery plan, enabling our company to more fully capture promising long term growth opportunities and remain a leader in global prestige beauty, and to reinforce our commitment to execute this larger plan with excellence, we have engaged global consulting firm, Alvarez & Marsal.', 'They will provide strategic advisory services, partnering with us on our restructuring program as part of the profit recovery plan to drive the realization of a sustainable rebuild of profitability. For the second half of the fiscal year, we have strategic initiatives and exciting innovation to drive in North America, re-accelerate growth in mainland China, and drive momentum in markets that are thriving across developed and emerging markets in EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Let me begin with the Clinique brand. The brand will be doubling down on its authentic dermatologist brand heritage of over 55 years, deepening its relationship with the scientific community, strengthening its derma messaging and engaging new consumers. First, Clinique will be dialing up its derma education and consumer communications, including on social media, brand.com and in-store with new dermatologist partnerships and ingredient communication.', 'Clinique has also announced the establishment of the new Mt. Sinai Clinique Healthy Skin Dermatology Center. The Center’s research is expected to produce breakthrough advancement in the study of allergic skin and premature aging. Next month, Clinique will return to the American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting to showcase its derm level science formulations, as well as its unique eye safety promise. All of this is coupled with Clinique’s continued innovation of allergy tested and 100% [indiscernible] products evidenced by Clinique’s new post-procedure relevant claim on powerful products, including Smart Clinical Repair lifting face and neck crème. Turning to the Estée Lauder brand, for over 50 years it has been a pioneer in longevity age reversal research, a frontier of skin biology for its Re-Nutriv luxury franchise.', 'Last August, I spoke with you about how Re-Nutriv should be standing upon its successful Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliant Serum with compelling innovation. The franchise breakthrough, Soft Clean with cutting edge patented SIRTIVITY-LP technology for visible age reversal is now launching globally. In [indiscernible], there is a companion serum crème foundation amplifying the franchise skin longevity science across categories. We are encouraged by the global appeal of this innovation from China to Japan to the U.S. While early, the franchise is welcoming new consumers at compelling rates, and we look forward to all that is to come for Re-Nutriv as launch events continue around the world. Moreover, the brand is collaborating with the Stanford Center of Longevity as the inaugural sponsor of a new program of esthetics and culture.', 'Beyond Re-Nutriv’s striking innovation, we have more standout launches across brands in the third quarter, led by MAC and Tom Ford. The new MACximal Silky Matte lipstick modernizes the MAC icon with a new silky matte finish, lip conditioning benefits, and elevated packaging. For Tom Ford, Oud Minerale is primed to carry forward the brand’s winning streak of innovation from Café Rose in the first half. In the second half, we expect these initiatives and new product launches to build upon the strong momentum of several brands. Indeed, The Ordinary, La Mer and Le Labo, among others achieved terrific performance in the second quarter. The Ordinary delivered an excellent first half as the brand again realized double-digit organic sales growth in the quarter.', 'Its new soothing and barrier support serum, which launched during the first quarter, is the brand’s most successful launch ever and is already among the top 10 ranked products in the U.S. prestige serum category. The Ordinary continue to excel in specialty multi globally and is also realizing very promising uptake on the new Tiktok shop in the United States through engaging live streaming and creator content. La Mer further contributed to our strong underlying fundamentals in skin care. The brand’s luxurious high quality product from the iconic crème, De La Mer to the new lifting firming serum, along with its exceptional services proved highly sought after by discerning consumers around the world. In mainland China, La Mer grew double digits at retail to realize strong share gains in prestige skin care.', 'Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances also performed quite well. Le Labo led the broad-based trends as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, Kilian Paris, and Editions de Parfum Frederic Malle each rose organically, fueling double-digit organic sales growth in Asia Pacific and gains in the Americas. For the second half, we expect to return to organic sales growth in mainland China driven by a rich innovation pipeline for a greater contribution to sales from new products in the second half than the first half, and we are investing in exciting go-to-market initiatives across brick and mortar and online. Impressively, we entered the third quarter in mainland China with momentum in brick and mortar, having expanded our prestige beauty share offline in the second quarter, driven by strong double-digit retail sales growth in each of department stores, specialty multi, and freestanding stores.', 'For online, while the channel was especially pressured by softness in overall prestige beauty and the 11/11 global shopping festival, our brands performed strongly [indiscernible] rising triple digits organically to partially offset lower sales for the event. The Estée Lauder brand ranked number one in prestige beauty [indiscernible], and it also ranked number one for store live streaming. For the fiscal year, we remain focused on North America returning to organic sales growth and are encouraged by the low single digit growth delivered in the first half. While makeup was pressured in the second quarter by the cadence of major new product launches, we are very excited by the innovation coming to market across the second half, beginning with MAC’s MACximal Silky Matte lipstick we launched last week.', 'Moreover, skin care grew for the second consecutive quarter in North America, driven by The Ordinary and Estée Lauder. Our luxury [indiscernible] fragrances rose double digits in the quarter as our strategic initiative from expanded consumer reach with Kilian Paris to strong engagement on Tiktok by [indiscernible] are proving successful. In closing, we are at an inflection point, poised to return to organic sales growth in the second half and deliver sequentially stronger profitability than the first half, as well as expansion from the year ago. We are well positioned to deliver stronger profitability in fiscal year 2025 and ’26, given the initial progress we have made from our profit recovery plan as well as its new restructuring program, and we are well positioned to invest in consumer-facing areas to capture exciting growth opportunities in global prestige beauty.', 'I wish to extend my gratitude to our leaders and their amazing teams for the hard work and dedication which has taken us to this inflection point on a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. I will now turn the call over to Tracey.', 'Tracey Travis: Thank you Fabrizio, and hello everyone. I’ll start by reviewing our second quarter financial results, followed by a third quarter and full year outlook. I’ll also provide details on our expanded profit recovery plan. As Fabrizio mentioned, our second quarter organic net sales decline of 8% met our expectations. Additionally, through tighter expense management and despite experiencing a higher tax rate due to the shift in our geographical mix of business, our earnings per share of $0.88 exceeded our initial outlook for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region declined 14%, mainly attributable to the persistent challenges in our Asia travel retail business.', 'The impact from business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East accounted for a 2% reduction in the region’s overall net sales growth. The markets in the region had mixed results, leading to overall flat growth across all markets. Organic net sales in our Asia-Pacific region fell 7%, reflecting continued challenges in mainland China. While our results on Douyin nearly doubled, our total online sales declined due to softer than expected performance on TMall during the 11.11 event. The overall online performance more than offset the increase in brick and mortar sales, which was led by double-digit growth in our freestanding stores. In the rest of the region, we saw strong organic net sales growth led by double-digit growth in Hong Kong SAR and Korea, as well as high single-digit growth in Japan.', 'Our luxury fragrance brands Le Labo, Jo Malone London, and Tom Ford drove double-digit fragrance growth in the region, which was fueled by both effective commercial activations as well as compelling holiday product offerings. Organic net sales in the Americas declined 1%, driven by a prior year benefit from changes made to MAC’s take-back loyalty program in North America last year. Excluding this benefit, net sales were relatively flat in North America, reflecting growth in specialty multi and our freestanding stores and offset by softer performance experienced in department stores and online. In Latin America, organic net sales rose double digits, reflecting continued growth in nearly every market and strong performance during holiday and key shopping moments.', 'From a category standpoint, organic net sales fell 10% in skincare and 8% in makeup. In skincare, the ongoing challenges in Asia travel retail and mainland China drove the majority of the decrease. Organic net sales from The Ordinary and La Mer grew across every geographic region. The Ordinary saw double-digit growth in specialty multi, including ongoing expansion, and continued its focus on education-first content to drive successful social media activations. Net sales from La Mer increased both online and in brick and mortar, benefiting from captivating social media and holiday product activations. In makeup, the persistent challenges in Asia travel retail were compounded by the prior year benefit from MAC that I previously mentioned. Organic net sales fell 6% in hair care and were flat in fragrance.', 'Net sales from La Labo grew double digits, fueled by both targeted expanded consumer reach and same store sales. The brand’s ethos and high touch services persistently attract both new and loyal consumers, as evidenced by the double-digit net sales growth in our freestanding stores as well as strong performance during holiday and key shopping moments. For Jo Malone London, results from the brand’s holiday collection were strong and net sales increased in nearly all channels of distribution. This growth was offset by a decline from Estée Lauder due to the timing of holiday shipments compared to last year. Our gross margin decreased 60 basis points compared to last year. The positive impacts from brand mix and net strategic pricing actions were more than offset by higher costs due to promotional items and foreign currency.', 'Operating expenses increased 260 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the reduction in sales. Selling, advertising and promotional activities and innovation collectively accounted for 160 basis points of the increase compared to last year as we supported retail growth while also continuing to destock certain accounts in Asia travel retail. Operating income declined 25% to $577 million, and our operating margin contracted to 13.5% from 16.6% in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% compared to 24.9% last year. The increase in rate was primarily due to a true-up in the quarter to reflect the now higher estimated tax rate on our foreign operations for fiscal 2024 as a result of the change in our geographical mix of earnings.', 'This also reflects an unfavorable impact related to previously issued share-based compensation. Diluted EPS of $0.88 decreased 43% compared to last year, including a dilutive impact of $0.19 from the change in the effective tax rate. The impact from business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.02 dilutive to EPS in the quarter. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS as interest expense related to our debt financing was offset by the combined benefits derived as the licensor of the brand from royalty revenue this year and savings from no longer having to pay licensee royalties. During the quarter, we generated $937 million in net cash flow from operating activities compared to $751 million last year.', 'The increase from last year reflects lower working capital partially offset by the decline in net earnings. The favorability from working capital was largely due to the actions we have taken to reduce inventory, primarily finished goods and semi-finished goods, that resulted in a significant improvement in our days to sell. We invested $527 million in capital expenditures and we returned $474 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024, which excludes the impact from the remaining payment for the outstanding Decium equity anticipated to occur in May 2024 and includes Clinique’s heightened focus in active derma, while we delivered on our Q2 expectations, we are lowering the high end of our fiscal ’24 organic net sales outlook range to reflect continued risks from evolving macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical tensions in certain areas around the world.', 'Despite this change to our sales outlook, we are maintaining our full year operating profitability expectation. Furthermore, we are updating our EPS outlook primarily to reflect the increase in our estimated full year effective tax rate, largely due to the anticipated geographical mix of our earnings. This is expected to more than offset the EPS benefit from foreign currency translation. Using December 29 spot rates of 1.107 for the euro, 1.273 for the pound, 7.109 for the Chinese yuan and 12.90 for the Korean yuan, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales for the third quarter and diluted EPS for both the third quarter and the full year. We expect organic net sales for our third quarter to increase 3% to 5% as both our businesses in Asia travel retail and in mainland China are expected to return to growth.', 'In Asia travel retail, this growth assumes the continued reduction in retailer inventory as well as the anniversary of some business disruptions we experienced last year. Currency translation and the potential risks of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.36 to $0.46, for a decrease between 3% to 24%. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each expected to dilute EPS by $0.03. Adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to range between an increase of 3% to a decline of 18%. For the full year, we expect reported and organic net sales to range between a decline of 1% and an increase of 1%.', 'Our plants have been running at reduced capacity, reflecting the pull-down of production in line with our lower shipments and to support the reduction of inventory levels both in-house and in the trade. This has resulted in inefficiencies in some of our manufacturing locations and may trigger a requirement to recognize the related manufacturing costs as in-period costs instead of when products are sold. We have reflected this potential expense and the corresponding pressure to gross margin in our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year, primarily in the third quarter. Our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged and is expected to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year, and planned to partially offset the incremental pressure to gross margin through disciplined expense management.', 'We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35% compared to 26.5% last year. The increase reflects a larger mix of our expected fiscal 2024 earnings in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the unfavorable impact of previously issued share-based compensation. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.08 and $2.23 before restructuring and other charges. The potential risks of further business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East and currency translation are expected to dilute earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.07 respectively. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 34% to 38%. Given the progress we have made in strategic initiatives the first half of the year, we expect to return to organic net sales growth and stronger operating profitability in the second half.', 'In November, we announced a profit recovery plan to support the progressive rebuilding of our profit margins in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Today with the announcement of a two-year restructuring program, we have further expanded this plan. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are focused on strategically leveraging our strengths to accelerate our return to more sustainable profitable growth while elevating our consumer activations and increasing our operating agility. The restructuring program is designed to right-size and streamline select areas within our organization, which unfortunately necessitates us making the difficult decision of an expected net reduction in positions globally of 3% to 5%. The restructuring program is expected to begin in the third quarter and continue for the duration of the profit recovery plan.', 'We expect to take charges of between $500 million and $700 million and generate annual gross savings of $350 million to $500 million before taxes. A portion of these savings is expected to be reinvested in consumer-facing activities to drive long term sustainable profitable growth. We now expect to drive incremental operating profit through all initiatives under the profit recovery plan of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, inclusive of net benefits from the restructuring program announced today. The plan is expected to yield almost all of the anticipated benefits by the end of fiscal year 2026, with slightly more than half of these benefits realized and contributing to operating profitability in fiscal 2025. In closing, we express our sincere gratitude to our teams around the world as they work tirelessly to execute against our priorities and drive our business forward.', 'We believe that with the work that is being done to position us to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year and beyond, and with the successful execution of our expanded profit recovery plan, we will be better positioned to return our company to long term sustainable growth and profitability. That concludes our prepared remarks.

With a diverse brand portfolio that includes Estee Lauder, Clinique, M.A.C, and La Mer, the company continues to make significant strides in skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care categories. The filing indicates a robust financial structure, with notable gains from cash flow hedges and cross-currency swap contracts contributing to net earnings. Despite facing challenges in the Asia travel retail business and overall prestige beauty softness in mainland China, Estee Lauder's comprehensive strategies and regional expertise position it well for future growth. The following SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as per the latest financial disclosures."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with EL.', ""Brand Equity and Diverse Portfolio: The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) boasts a powerful brand portfolio that spans across various beauty categories. This diversity not only mitigates risks associated with market fluctuations in a single category but also allows for cross-promotion and customer retention. For instance, the company's skin care segment, which accounts for 56% of its 2022 sales, benefits from the halo effect of its prestigious makeup and fragrance lines. The brand equity of Estee Lauder is further reinforced by its premium pricing strategy, which aligns with the consumer perception of high-quality, luxury products."", ""Global Footprint and Strategic Market Segmentation: EL's presence in over 150 countries is a testament to its global appeal and strategic market segmentation. The company generates 26% of its revenue from the Americas, 43% from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and 31% from the Asia Pacific region. This geographical diversification not only spreads risk but also provides multiple avenues for growth. The brand's ability to tailor its offerings to regional preferences and trends is a key strength that drives its international success."", ""Financial Resilience: The financial tables from the 10-Q filing reflect EL's financial resilience. The company's strategic use of derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, has effectively hedged against currency volatility, contributing positively to net earnings. This financial acumen underscores EL's ability to manage its capital efficiently and protect its bottom line from external economic fluctuations."", ""Geopolitical Sensitivity and Currency Risks: While EL's global presence is a strength, it also exposes the company to geopolitical risks and currency fluctuations. The filing notes that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar could negatively impact results within Europe, the Middle East, and Africa due to pricing pressures on retail customers and consumers in key international travel retail locations. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, could materially affect EL's business operations and financial performance."", ""Operational Challenges in Key Markets: The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) faces operational challenges in key markets, such as the Asia travel retail business and mainland China's overall prestige beauty market. The 10-Q filing indicates an 8% decrease in net sales in the Asia/Pacific region for the three months ended December 31, 2023, reflecting the ongoing softness in these markets. This weakness could impact the company's revenue growth and profitability if not effectively addressed."", ""Inventory and Supply Chain Management: EL's inventory and promotional merchandise management is crucial to its success. Any inefficiencies in this area could lead to increased costs or stockouts, which in turn could harm customer satisfaction and sales. The company's supplier finance programs, while providing flexibility, also necessitate careful management to avoid liquidity issues."", ""Technological Advancements and Digital Engagement: EL has the opportunity to further leverage technological advancements and digital engagement to enhance its consumer experience and operational efficiency. The company's emphasis on digital and social media presence, as well as the engagement of global and local influencers, is a strategic move that can amplify brand stories and drive sales, especially among younger demographics."", ""Emerging Markets and Consumer Trends: The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) can capitalize on emerging markets and evolving consumer trends. With a strategic focus on broadening its presence in these markets, EL can tap into new customer segments and increase its market share. Additionally, the company's ability to adapt to changing consumer behaviors, such as the increasing demand for sustainable and clean beauty products, presents significant growth opportunities."", ""Innovation and Product Development: Innovation is at the core of EL's business strategy. The company's commitment to introducing new products and reformulating existing ones to meet consumer needs can drive sales growth. By staying ahead of industry trends and continuously investing in research and development, EL can maintain its competitive edge and attract a loyal customer base."", ""Intense Competition: The beauty industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.', 'Revenues are expected to be $3.53 billion, down 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.15% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$23b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Eaton surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$8.02 per share, modestly greater than expected. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Eaton ', ""Following the latest results, Eaton's 17 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$25.0b in 2024. This would be a reasonable 7.6% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to expand 15% to US$9.26. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$24.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.87 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Eaton's earnings potential following these results."", ""The analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 8.7% to US$268. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Eaton at US$310 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$200. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that Eaton's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 7.6% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 0.8% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 7.8% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Eaton is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Eaton's earnings potential next year. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Eaton. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To start with, Universal Health Services' ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Despite this, Universal Health Services' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures."", 'Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 8.5% over the last few years.', ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.

This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""Universal Health Services has a low three-year median payout ratio of 6.9% (or a retention ratio of 93%) but the negligible earnings growth number doesn't reflect this as high growth usually follows high profit retention."", ""Additionally, Universal Health Services has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 5.6%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 12%."", ""Overall, we feel that Universal Health Services certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits.

The company is likely to have gained from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands in the to-be-reported quarter.PEP’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. PepsiCo is likely to have benefited from the resilience and strength of the global beverage and convenient food businesses.We expect year-over-year consolidated organic revenue growth of 6.2% for the fourth quarter, driven by a 9.6% rise in the price/mix, offset by a 3.5% decline in volume.Market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. Investments in innovation and execution also bode well.The company’s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay’s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.However, PepsiCo’s fourth-quarter gross margin is expected to have been partly negated by inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Adverse currency rates are also likely to have been headwinds.Increased advertising and marketing expenses, along with additional investments to build digital capabilities and integrate purpose throughout the company, are likely to have led to a rise in SG&A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.We anticipate the adjusted gross margin to expand 30 bps to 52.8% in the fourth quarter. Margin growth can be attributed to the easing of supply-chain headwinds, partly offset by inflationary costs. Meanwhile, our estimate for adjusted SG&A expenses of $11.9 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 1.1%.

In part, that's because they make it easier for investors on a budget to purchase a single share. So when a stock starts getting too expensive, it could be a sign that the company may conduct a stock split relatively soon."", ""Let's consider two stocks that have beaten the market in recent years and, some would say, are overdue for a split: MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN)."", ""MercadoLibre is the leading e-commerce platform in Latin America. However, the company's services extend far beyond e-commerce. MercadoLibre created an ecosystem that gives merchants access to all the tools they need to be successful online retailers, from payment processing and shipping solutions to the ability to create and customize an online storefront. Like many other e-commerce leaders, MercadoLibre saw its shares soar in the early days of the pandemic, only to drop substantially between 2021 and 2022 once that tailwind ended."", ""It's been recovering in the past year, though. The company's shares have outpaced the S&P 500 over the past five years. But at a share price of about $1,772 as of this writing, MercadoLibre could benefit from a stock split. It has never resorted to this move, so don't hold your breath. Still, a split would help make shares look more affordable -- perceptions matter."", ""Even if the company doesn't opt to split its stock, MercadoLibre is an outstanding stock to buy, and resorting to fractional shares is fine. Besides its lead in the e-commerce market in Latin America, MercadoLibre has competitive advantages."", ""It benefits from the network effect since the more merchants join its ecosystem, the more attractive it becomes to consumers, and vice versa. MercadoLibre's platform also has switching costs: Given the services it provides to merchants that help them build successful online presences, their jumping ship to a competitor carries high potential costs."", ""The company's financial results have been solid:"", ""There's more where that came from. The e-commerce industry should continue growing for a long time, since both merchants and consumers benefit.

The drugmaker has performed well in recent years thanks to a pair of growth drivers: Eylea and Dupixent. Eylea treats wet age-related macular degeneration, while Dupixent targets eczema. Even with recent negative developments, these medicines should continue contributing meaningfully to Regeneron's top-line growth."", ""The issues mostly come from Eylea, which has been battling a competing therapy named Vabysmo since early 2022. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a high-dose formulation of Eylea late last year; among other things, that reduces the number of required doses per year for some patients without sacrificing efficacy -- a significant selling point. This new approval should help Eylea remain one of Regeneron's key assets."", ""Dupixent is still going strong and may be Regeneron's most important therapy right now. However, the biotech has been branching out into exciting areas, such as gene therapies and gene editing, through collaborations with smaller biotechs. Its rich pipeline boasts 46 programs, including 11 in phase 3 studies. Over the long run, that will mean newer drugs to replace those facing stiff competition, generic or otherwise."", ""Regeneron's financial results in the past few years have been inconsistent due to its COVID-19 therapies:"", ""But overall, the company's revenue and earnings have been on a solid upward trend.
