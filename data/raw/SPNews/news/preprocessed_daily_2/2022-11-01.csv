Shaw.Verisk bought Wood Mackenzie in 2015 from buyout firm Hellman &amp; Friedman. It provides data and analysis for the energy, renewables and natural resource industry.This year, Verisk has already sold its 3E business, which was part of its energy and specialized markets segment, to investment firm New Mountain Capital, while credit information provider TransUnion has bought Verisk's financial services unit.Demand for insurance analytics and risk assessment has strengthened as insurers look for ways to navigate a surge in claims from frequent catastrophes, while facing an uncertain economy and decades-high inflation.Terms of the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, include an additional contingent payment of up to $200 million in the future for Verisk.

1,935317a1-93dc-3b6b-8185-73469d34a348,TXN,2022-11-01,Texas Instruments Incorporated's (NASDAQ:TXN) Shares May Have Run Too Fast Too Soon,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-incorporateds-nasdaq-txn-110015865.html,1667300415,STORY,['TXN'],"[With a median price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of close to 15x in the United States, you could be forgiven for feeling indifferent about Texas Instruments Incorporated's  (NASDAQ:TXN) P/E ratio of 16.4x. While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Texas Instruments has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Texas Instruments.Does Growth Match The P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the market for P/E ratios like Texas Instruments' to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 22% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 79% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to slump, contracting by 1.5% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.7% growth each year, that's a disappointing outcome.In light of this, it's somewhat alarming that Texas Instruments' P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company reject the analyst cohort's pessimism and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the negative growth outlook.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Texas Instruments' P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Texas Instruments' analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see a poor outlook with earnings heading backwards, we suspect share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Texas Instruments  that you should be aware of.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20x).Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+69.3% vs. +41.6%). The company’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.Exxon Mobil has made more than 30 discoveries in offshore Guyana since 2015. ExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the prolific Permian Basin, where it expects to boost production volumes by 25% in 2022. The energy major has significantly lower debt exposure than composite players belonging to the industry. XOM recently reported strong third-quarter earnings owing to higher prices and production, and strong refining margins.However, the company has been constantly bearing the brunt of increasing expenses, adversely affecting the income. Also, the aggressive capital budget remains a headwind for the company. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Exxom Mobil here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of T-Mobile have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+28.2% vs. -13.8%). The company reported relatively modest third-quarter 2022 results with industry-leading growth in postpaid and broadband customers driven by superior 5G network and focus on customers. It is on track to complete the Sprint customer network decommissioning by the year-end.T-Mobile has augmented its 5G footprint by introducing 5G Home Internet services in several states. With healthy demand trends, T-Mobile has raised the guidance for 2022 across the board.However, it operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent. Several promotional activities to lure additional customers are further eroding its profitability. Furthermore, it is engaging in leasing strategy to gain customers, thereby exposing it to credit risk. Debt obligation woes also persist.(You can read the full research report on T-Mobil here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Intuitive Surgical’s shares have declined -30.7% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry’s decline of -33.5%. The company is facing stiff competition in the global MedTech space and rising costs remain a concern. Nevertheless, its da Vinci procedure volume demonstrated strong recovery in the first nine months of 2022, a trend likely to continue in upcoming quarter.Intuitive Surgical’s revenue growth in the quarter under review reflected rise in revenues from procedures, system placements and services across all markets. Per management, strong U.S. dollar, lingering supply chain issues and inflation hurt operating margin.Despite this challenging environment, Intuitive Surgical witnessed healthy customer demand for its products in the quarter under review. A stable liquidity position is an added plus.(You can read the full research report on Intuitive Surgical here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

This compares to earnings of $1.53 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.82%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of $1.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of 13.18%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Aflac , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, posted revenues of $4.82 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.43%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Aflac shares have added about 11% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.2%.What's Next for Aflac?While Aflac has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Aflac: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

However, an active catastrophe level is likely to have weighed on the upside.Better pricing, solid retention and exposure growth across business lines are likely to have aided premiums. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided in better pricing in the third quarter.Better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results. The third quarter of 2022 bore the brunt of Hurricane Ian. Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian to be in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion.Increased travel across the world is likely to have induced higher auto premiums. A stronger mortgage market is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums. A low unemployment rate is likely to have aided commercial insurance and group insurance. Lower mortality claims are likely to have aided margin expansion.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are expected to come up with improved investment results. The third quarter itself saw two rate hikes. A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate among others are expected to have aided net investment income.Accelerated digitalization is expected to have saved costs, thus aiding margins. A solid capital position aided insurers to get involved in strategic mergers and acquisitions to sharpen their competitive edge, build on a niche, expand geographically and diversify their portfolio apart from engaging in share buybacks and raising dividends in the third quarter.Let’s take a sneak peek into how the abovementioned insurers are poised prior to their third-quarter 2022 earnings on Nov 1.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.American International Group’s improved retention, new business and continued growth in the insurance premium rate are likely to have increased net premiums earned in General Insurance for the third quarter.

QRVO is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 2, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 6.1%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.5%, on average.The Greensboro, NC-based company is expected to have recorded year-over-year lower revenues due to the challenging macroeconomic environment.Factors at PlayDuring the quarter, Qorvo launched the highest gain 100-watt L-band compact solution, an innovative GaN-on-SiC power amplifier module, which will be used in commercial and defense radar applications. The QPA2511 GaN-on-Sic Power Amplifier Module has been integrated into a robust surface mount package to simplify broad assembly, testing and system design. This will improve its reliability quotient and accelerate time to market alongside fine-tuning customer manufacturing cycles.  Qorvo also introduced the QPD1034, a 1700 watt high power RF Gallium Nitride pallet, which addresses a growing need for modular, scalable, reliable and fully tested high-power RF products to support avionics applications, including air traffic control radar. Such state-of-the-art products are likely to have aided its performance in the quarter.However, macroeconomic woes, dollar strength and high concentration risks are likely to have eroded margins. Qorvo operates in a competitive landscape that is becoming more complex with low barriers to entry. As each player strives to win designs to have a greater pie in the market, the battle gets murkier. The competitive landscape that is becoming more complex with low barriers to entry is likely to have affected its top line in the fiscal second quarter.For the September quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1,135 million, which indicates a decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $1,255 million. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at $2.55, suggesting a decline from $3.42 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Qorvo for the fiscal second quarter.

The 2022 U.S. Bank CFO Insights Report, released today, found that finance leaders’ priorities have shifted as they work to help guide their firms through choppy waters.The top-line survey results revealed that:Improving risk identification and mitigation is now a top priority for 30% of finance leaders. In 2021, risk management was the least identified top priority (18%).Driving revenue growth is a top priority for only 21% of finance leaders. In 2021, driving revenue growth was a top priority for 35% of leaders.Cutting costs and driving efficiencies within the finance function and across the entire business also came in as top priorities this year.30% of finance leaders said cutting costs and driving efficiencies within the finance function is a top priority; 29% of finance leaders said cutting costs and driving efficiencies across the business is a top priority.When it comes to cutting costs, just 22% of finance leaders plan to reduce headcount across the enterprise, down from 40% in 2021.Finance leaders plan to cut costs through investing in technology (37%), discontinuing low-margin/low-growth business lines (32%) and outsourcing certain business functions (29%).The automotive and transportation industry was most likely to reduce headcount to cut costs, while the chemicals and advanced materials, professional services and technology industries were least likely.The lack of appetite to cut headcount might be explained by the top business risk identified by finance leaders: talent shortages.Talent shortages were identified as a top risk for 40% of finance leaders. The results were nearly identical for firms with more than $1 billion in revenue (41%) and those with less (40%).Talent shortage risks were ahead of risks posed by the pace of digital disruption (36%) and high inflation (34%). Just 17% said rising interest rates were a top risk.Story continues""Our clients in the CFO office are facing a barrage of challenges – with new ones emerging seemingly every day – as they help guide their firms through a very uncertain external environment,"" said Stephen Philipson, executive vice president at U.S. Bank Corporate &amp; Commercial Banking. ""Finance leaders should take this opportunity to play an even more significant role in risk management, ensuring they have an appropriate strategy to play defense while continuing to grow the bottom line.""Fewer than 15% of finance leaders are highly confident in their company’s ability to manage any of the identified business risks. For example, just 4% are highly confident they’ll manage high inflation.Risk managementThe top risks for businesses are:Talent shortage (40%).Pace of tech change and digital disruption (36%).High inflation (34%).Regarding inflation risks:The majority (57%) are identifying opportunities to cut costs, but fewer than four in 10 are conducting any other possible steps to manage inflation risks.35% are evaluating the credit risk of major customers.32% are evaluating working capital practices.32% are evaluating pricing.31% are hedging against rising costs of certain commodities and currencies.Just 22% are evaluating salaries.Regarding talent shortage risks:51% are assessing future skill requirements.42% are reviewing salaries and other employee benefits.42% are exploring opportunities to automate manual processes.Just 18% are offering hybrid working for certain roles to manage talent risks.Additional findings from 2022 U.S. Bank CFO Survey include:Evaluating M&amp;A, divestiture and partnership opportunities dropped from 26% in 2021 to 21% this year.Support and/or furthering ESG objectives dropped from 30% to 22%.View the full 2022 CFO Insights ReportAbout U.S. BankU.S. Bancorp, with approximately 70,000 employees and $601 billion in assets as of September 30, 2022, is the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association.

Global nitrogen demand is expected to have remained strong, driven by high crop commodity prices. Industrial demand recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions.Strong nitrogen demand driven by higher commodity prices and higher nitrogen prices is likely to have aided the company’s sales and margins in the September quarter. Nitrogen prices are likely to have been driven by lower supply resulting from reduced operating rates globally due to higher energy prices.However, higher natural gas costs, partly stemming from increased in natural gas costs in Europe, are likely to have increased the cost of sales and impacted the company’s margins in the third quarter.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

16,97b52ab0-461f-3607-b63a-e10224df64f9,WMT,2022-11-01,Institutions own 32% of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares but private companies control 47% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutions-own-32-walmart-inc-120020178.html,1667304020,STORY,['WMT'],"[If you want to know who really controls Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 47% stake, private companies possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutions on the other hand have a 32% ownership in the company. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Walmart, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Walmart ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walmart?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Walmart does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Walmart's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthWalmart is not owned by hedge funds. Walton Enterprises, LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 37% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 4.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Walton Family and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 3 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of WalmartThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Walmart Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$3.5b worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Company OwnershipWe can see that Private Companies own 47%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Walmart , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

This compares to earnings of $0.63 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19.70%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this water and wastewater treatment company would post earnings of $0.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.66, delivering a surprise of 20%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Xylem , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, posted revenues of $1.38 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.77%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.27 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Xylem shares have lost about 14.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Xylem?While Xylem has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Xylem: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.78 on $1.4 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.58 on $5.38 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

21,1009fac2-eed2-350f-b008-e8d723fb2471,XYL,2022-11-01,Xylem Reports Third Quarter 2022 Results,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xylem-reports-third-quarter-2022-105500313.html,1667300100,STORY,['XYL'],"[Lifting full-year organic revenue growth guidance to 9% to 10%, from 8% to 10%Raising full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $2.65 to $2.75, from $2.50 to $2.70Third quarter revenue growth of 9% on a reported basis, 16% organicallyReported earnings per share of $0.07, adjusted earnings per share of $0.79WASHINGTON, November 01, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported third quarter revenue of $1.4 billion, surpassing previous guidance, with strong commercial and operational execution. While orders were down 7 percent on a reported basis, they were down 1 percent organically, with the difference due to currency. The Company reported resilient underlying global demand with strong backlog growth.Earnings also exceeded Xylem’s previous guidance, with strong margin performance. Net income was $12 million, or $0.07 per share. Net income margin decreased 810 basis points to 0.9 percent. These results were mainly driven by a previously announced, one-time non-cash pension plan settlement. Adjusted net income was $144 million, or $0.79 per share, which excludes the impacts of restructuring, realignment and special charges. Third quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin was 18.3 percent, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 40 basis points. Strong price realization offset inflation and, coupled with productivity savings, drove the margin expansion, exceeding the impact of strategic investments.""The team delivered very strong performance across all our regions, driving third quarter results well above expectations on all key metrics,"" said Patrick Decker, Xylem president and CEO. ""Demand remains resilient across our largest end-markets, and disciplined operational execution delivered double-digit revenue growth with strong margin expansion.""Story continues""We anticipate our momentum will continue driven by the essential nature of the services we provide. Our strong backlog and bidding pipelines support that outlook. The team, from our factories to our channel partners, continues to demonstrate resilience in managing through a dynamic environment, as our customers and communities invest in essential water infrastructure. Based on this strength, we are further raising our full-year guidance for both revenue and earnings per share, with continued confidence in Xylem’s longer-term growth outlook.""OutlookXylem now expects full-year 2022 organic revenue growth to be in the range of 9 to 10 percent, and approximately 4 percent on a reported basis. This represents a raise of the low end of the Company’s previous full-year organic revenue guidance of 8 to 10 percent, and 3 to 5 percent on a reported basis. Full-year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be approximately 17.0 percent, raising the low end of the previous range of 16.5 to 17.0 percent. This results in adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.75, an increase from the previous range of $2.50 to $2.70. The increased guidance reflects strong demand, gradual easing of supply chain constraints, and price realization, partially offset by inflation and foreign exchange headwinds.Further 2022 planning assumptions are included in Xylem’s third quarter 2022 earnings materials posted at www.xylem.com/investors. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort.Third Quarter Segment ResultsWater InfrastructureXylem’s Water Infrastructure segment consists of its portfolio of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, and dewatering.Third quarter 2022 revenue was $574 million, a 5 percent increase, 13 percent organically, compared with third quarter 2021. This strong growth was driven by price realization, robust utilities demand in the US and Western Europe, and dewatering demand in the US and Emerging Markets.Third quarter reported operating income for the segment was $104 million, a 3.0 percent increase versus the comparable period last year. Adjusted operating income for the segment, which excludes $3 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $107 million, a 4.9 percent increase versus the comparable period last year. Reported operating margin for the segment was 18.1 percent, down 40 basis points versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 18.6 percent, flat versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.7 percent, down 50 basis points from the prior year. Favorable price realization net of inflation was offset by strategic investments and unfavorable mix.Applied WaterXylem’s Applied Water segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in industrial, commercial building, and residential applications.Third quarter 2022 Applied Water revenue was $458 million, a 15 percent increase, 20 percent organically, year-over-year. The robust growth was driven by strong price realization and backlog execution across all end markets.Third quarter reported operating income for the segment was $77 million, a 28.3 percent increase versus comparable period last year, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $1 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $78 million, a 25.8 percent increase versus the comparable period last year. The segment reported operating margin was 16.8 percent, up 180 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points over the prior year period to 17.0 percent. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.1 percent, up 110 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion was driven by strong price realization more than offsetting inflation coupled with productivity savings.Measurement &amp; Control SolutionsXylem’s Measurement &amp; Control Solutions segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in smart metering, network technologies, advanced infrastructure analytics, and analytic instrumentation.Third quarter 2022 Measurement &amp; Control Solutions revenue was $348 million, up 9 percent, 15 percent organically, versus the prior year. While chip supply remains constrained, we continue to see modest sequential improvement, and strength in our water quality test applications.Third quarter reported operating income for the segment was $(2) million, a 128.6 percent decrease versus the comparable period last year, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $2 million of restructuring and realignment costs and $12 million of special charges, was $12 million, a 100 percent increase versus the comparable period last year. The segment reported operating margin was (0.6) percent, down 280 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin of 3.4 percent increased 150 basis points over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.8 percent, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Strong price realization, volume growth and productivity savings were more than offset by higher inflation.Supplemental information on Xylem’s third quarter 2022 earnings and reconciliations for certain non-GAAP items is posted at www.xylem.com/investors.About XylemXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to solving critical water and infrastructure challenges with innovation.

Non-GAAP MeasuresManagement reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or ""adjusted"") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following items to represent the non-GAAP measures we consider to be key performance indicators, as well as the related reconciling items to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.""Organic revenue"" and ""Organic orders"" defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures.

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.

He also talked about the Inflation Reduction Act and said that all countries need to take more ambitious steps to reverse the climate crisis. In another interview with Reuters last month, Al Gore said that the current environment with rising oil prices can encourage governments to decarbonize faster. He further mentioned that investments in a clean economy are expected to exceed $1 trillion over the next few years.Al Gore's firm launched a new fund earlier this year that targets companies contributing to lower emissions. The $1.7 billion Sustainable Solutions Fund IV will allow the hedge fund to invest in corporations that are shifting their industries and operations toward sustainability. Moreover, the fund recently announced its collaboration with other ESG-centric programs to make investments in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Overall ESG stocks are gaining ground among investors as they try to increase their sustainable investing exposure. Since 2010, ESG funds have significantly outperformed non-ESG funds in America and Europe, according to a report by Economist.At the end of Q2 2022, Generation Investment Management’s 13F portfolio had a total value of over $18.3 billion, compared with $21.8 billion in the previous quarter.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP), the microcontroller (MCU) and analog semiconductor producer, was also a primary detractor for the period. Shares declined during the quarter despite strong fundamentals, as the company posted its fifth consecutive quarter of record revenues. After years of industry consolidation and cost cutting, led by Microchip’s disciplined and frugal executives, the business is executing on our catalyst of enhanced profitability, with operating margins exceeding 40%. FREE cash flow generation has continued to improve, allowing the company to pay out $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchase $426 million shares since fiscal year 2019. Having paid down $5 billion in debt during the same period, Microchip’s credit rating was upgraded to investment grade in 2021, reflecting its higher-quality balance sheet. While we recognize Microchip operates in a cyclical industry, we admire the company’s history of strong FREE cash flow generation through the cycles. Moreover, our conviction remains in Microchip’s ability to grow its market share while uniquely benefiting from the secular trend of expanded usage of MCUs across segments that include 5G products, Internet of Things (IoT), data centers, electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems.”10. The Cooper Companies, Inc. (NYSE:COO)Generation Investment Management's Stake Value: $394,222,000The Cooper Companies, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The Cooper Companies, Inc. (NYSE:COO) is the second largest contact lens manufacturer and a leading provider of women’s health and fertility products and services. We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from several profit cycle drivers. First, a broad shift from reusable contact lenses to soft, daily disposable lenses is underway. The convenience of less upkeep and increased comfort makes daily lenses an attractive option with higher recurring revenues to Cooper. We are also drawn to the company’s MiSight soft contact lens product, which is used to treat myopia (nearsightedness). Myopia is a global health issue—associated with increased screen time and indoor activity—affecting ~30% of the population and is expected to reach 50% over the coming decades (with particularly high prevalence among children). MiSight is the first and only FDA-approved myopia control contact lens, and we believe it could open a multi-billion-dollar market and be a meaningful growth driver in the years ahead. Meanwhile, the company has made several acquisitions to accelerate the growth of its smaller (~25% of revenue) women’s health business.”9.

Here is what the firm has to say:“CSL’s recent update indicated that the worst COVID-19 impacts on the business are likely past, with plasma collections now snapping back. CSL’s core business continues to enjoy significant competitive advantages, in our view, and, as collected plasma is processed into finished products, we believe sales will return to their pre-COVID-19 levels. It will take time for this to play out, but it is a welcome improvement. Most of the other segments of the business are performing well, and steady demand for CSL’s products, which are less economically sensitive, has likely contributed to the stability of shares recently.”8.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can also take a look at Top 5 Life Insurance Companies In The World.Life Insurance Industry: An AnalysisThe life insurance industry is a vital part of the financial services sector in the United States. It helps provide financial security for families in the event of the death of a breadwinner, and also offers a variety of other products and services to meet the needs of policyholders. The industry is highly competitive, with a large number of companies offering a variety of products. Life insurance companies must be licensed in every state in which they do business, and are subject to regulation by the state insurance commissioner. The life insurance industry has undergone a number of changes in recent years, including the introduction of new products, the consolidation of companies, and the emergence of new distribution channels.According to statistics from McKinsey, life insurance made up 45% of global premiums in 2019, up 4.4% from its share in 2018. Global life insurance gross premiums went up by 4% in 2019, in line with the growth rate in 2017 and 2018. Developing economies in the Asia Pacific region exhibited the fastest growth in the world, and grew by 10% in 2019. The pandemic drove the life insurance premiums growth in 2020 and 2021, however, growth attributed to the pandemic appears to be slowing down according to the 2023 insurance outlook by Deloitte. Deloitte analysts expect a minor contraction in global premiums growth in 2022, 0.2%, partly due to rising interest rates and surging inflation. However, Deloitte forecasts that global premiums growth will rebound in 2023 and record a 1.9% increase in the year across emerging markets as the inflation situation cools down and economic conditions improve. Deloitte expects life insurance premiums to fall across North America, Europe, and China in 2022. However, the firm sees emerging markets, excluding China, registering a positive growth print of 3.5% for premiums in 2022, led by India recording a 6% increase in life insurance premiums for the year.

We provide these measures to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future. Investors are cautioned that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be defined in the same manner by other companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Also, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as alternatives, or superior, to other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this Press Release are defined below.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin: Represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for: (i) interest expense, net; (ii) tax provision (benefit); (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt, if applicable; (iv) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, if applicable; (v) other (income) expense, net; (vi) stock-based compensation expense; (vii) depreciation, amortization, and accretion; (viii) loss on impairment of lease related assets, net, if applicable; and (ix) acquisition and integration charges and certain other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by GAAP Revenue. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are important measures of our recurring operations as they exclude items not representative of our core operating results.Adjusted Net Income: Represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include: (i) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) acquisition and integration charges and other non-recurring items; (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt, if applicable; (iv) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, if applicable; (v) loss on impairment of lease related assets, net if applicable; (vi) the non-cash (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps, if applicable; and (vii) the related tax effect. We believe Adjusted Net Income is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.Adjusted EPS: Represents GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include on a per share basis: (i) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) acquisition and integration charges and other non-recurring items; (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt, if applicable; (iv) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, if applicable; (v) loss on impairment of lease related assets, net if applicable; (vi) the non-cash (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps, if applicable; and (vii) the related tax effect. We believe Adjusted EPS is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.Free Cash Flow: Represents cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP less payments for capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by the Company’s core operations that may be available to be used to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.Foreign Currency Neutral (FX Neutral): We provide foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages for our contract values, revenues, certain expenses, and other metrics. These foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and thus provide a more accurate and meaningful trend in the underlying data being measured. We calculate foreign currency neutral dollar amounts by converting the underlying amounts in local currency for different periods into U.S. dollars by applying the same foreign exchange rates to all periods presented.SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONSThe tables below provide reconciliations of certain Non-GAAP financial measures used in this Press Release with the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

If you want to jump ahead to the top five companies in this list, then take a look at 5 Biggest Gas Companies in the World.The Gas Industry: An AnalysisThe ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the global push toward clean energy have placed an even higher premium on natural gas. The fuel has multiple advantages over both renewable energy and crude oil. Natural gas is a clean burning fuel, which results in fewer emissions and it is also able to generate higher amounts of energy per kilogram.Globally, gas is being sold at a premium and prices touched record high earlier this year when they crossed $10 per MMBtu. The prices have almost halved since then, and the natural gas futures market, which bets on the prices of the commodity for the next month, are also significantly down year to date. Yet, the futures continue to trade at the higher end of their 52-week range, as the shock in prices that erupted this year continues to make its mark felt.As for the gas industry itself, it is still one of the largest in the world and according to the research firm The Business Research Company, the market was worth $840 billion last year. From then to the end of this year, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% to sit at $940 billion. Additionally, the firm goes on to add that from the end of 2022 to 2026, the market will grow at a 6.9% CAGR and be worth $1.23 trillion by the end of the forecast period.For our list for you today, we will take a look at the largest natural gas companies in the world, and among the publicly traded names, the ones likely to catch your eye are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Photo by Robin Sommer on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn order to sift out the largest natural gas companies in the world, we studied the revenue of the companies and then ranked them according to their net sales.

Here is what the fund said:“We added one new position this quarter, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are met by TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in our list of the world's largest gas companies. Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Gas Companies in the World.  Suggested Articles:Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks To BuyWhat Are the Best Stocks To Buy Now?10 Most Undervalued Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 15 Biggest Gas Companies in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

For more gold stocks, head on over to 5 Biggest Gold Companies in Canada. In times of economic turmoil, there are a handful of assets that investors rely on. An economic downturn coupled with inflation reduces confidence in the stock market as share prices are likely to drop in the wake of corporations suffering from weak revenue. Naturally, this leaves limited avenues for investors to increase their value of money, and the current economic environment is no exception.Throughout the course of this year, investors have abandoned the stock market and flocked to the U.S. dollar, as the Federal Reserve's consistent efforts to combat inflation have raised the interest that banks offer their customers. This had led to other currencies, such as the Great British Pound, to tumble, since the interest rates offered in the United States are among the highest in the world. The dollar's status as the world's reserve currency also leads to it becoming a stable asset to hold as the prices of others drop.However, the big debate in markets right now is will the Federal Reserve reach the much awaited (or dreaded, depending on who you ask) 'pivot' soon. This will be when the bank decides enough is enough and that its efforts to control inflation have finally started to bear fruit. The U.S. dollar itself has been quite jittery lately, as investors are keenly watching currency fluctuations, and even a small hint that the Fed might stop its interest rate hikes soon results in the value of other currencies such as the Pound and the Euro increasing immediately.Another indicator of the market's perception of a pivot is the gold price. Widely thought of as another stable investment, the only drawback of holding gold is that it does not pay interest. The strength of the U.S. dollar this year has led to gold prices dropping to multi year lows, and many analysts believe that once the dollar weakens, gold will go up.Story continuesCanadian Gold Industry: An AnalysisTherefore, now might be the right time to start looking at gold stocks. Canada has one of the largest natural resource reserves in the world, and its primary stock exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange or TSX, has the bulk of the global mining companies.

These could all drive crude prices higher.""Our target on oil is $115 a barrel in the first quarter, but there's upside risk on that,"" Currie said.Crude oil prices have risen in this year, thanks to the fallout from Russia's war on Ukraine. Western sanctions against Moscow have squeezed supply.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, have jumped 20.7% year-to-date to trade at $93.81 a barrel at last check Tuesday. Meanwhile, WTI crude futures — the US benchmark, have climbed 16.9% to $87.34 a barrel in the same period.The OPEC+ group of oil producers — which includes Russia and Saudi Arabia – said in early October they would cut oil production quotas by 2 million barrels a day.

Like Musk’s dream for a Martian colony, the startup’s grand vision is to build a human settlement on the moon by 2040, but before that it wants to become the lunar version of FedEx -- earning money by ferrying scientific equipment and commercial goods to the moon.Ispace’s maiden mission will put to the test not just the technological credentials it’s built since its founding in 2010 but also the faith of its backers, one of whom is a former SoftBank Group Corp. executive. A lot rides on its success, including a potential initial public offering as early as this fiscal year and a shot at a bigger sliver of an industry pie that Morgan Stanley estimates will triple to $1 trillion in two decades from 2020.“There’s a vast market for services like these,” ispace’s founder and Chief Executive Officer Takeshi Hakamada, 43, said in an interview. “If something goes wrong with this attempt, we can still use the feedback from the failure to boost the quality of the next launch.”Bankers for IPOThe company is preparing for a listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and has picked SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Nomura Holdings Inc. as lead managers, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. A representative for ispace declined to comment.Story continuesIspace says it’s raised about $237 million in total as of July, of which $57 million is borrowings. It was valued at about 76 billion yen ($511 million) in a Series C equity financing in August last year. Led by Incubate Fund, the round brought in six other investors including SoftBank’s former chief strategy officer Katsunori Sago and funds managed by Innovation Engine Inc. and SBI Investment Co.The moon lander mission is part of ispace’s lunar exploration program called Hakuto-R, which means white rabbit in Japanese. The startup says it can reduce fuel costs by taking advantage of the moon’s gravity to travel. The downside is it will take as long as five months to reach the moon, compared to the roughly three days it took for the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s.SpaceX’s Falcon 9Set for launch on a Falcon 9 rocket built by Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., ispace’s moon lander is part of a $73 million NASA contract won by a team led by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Draper. The deal envisages end-to-end delivery services to the far side of the moon under the US Artemis program.“The first private lunar lander will be a major milestone for the space industry,” said Caleb Henry, a senior analyst at Quilty Analytics, a US-based research and advisory firm.The Mission 1 lunar lander has been flown to Cape Canaveral in Florida for its space odyssey, the company said in a statement Monday.Ispace’s success will also be critical to Japan’s own space program as the moon once again becomes the focus of geopolitical intrigue. NASA is targeting a return this decade with its Artemis, while China and Russia have announced plans for a joint lunar base. Last year, Japan’s Lunar Industry Vision Council urged closer cooperation between state and private sectors to remain competitive in the budding space economy.Sago said the company’s valuation has the potential to multiply over the coming years. “I don’t invest in startups unless they have enough potential to grow by 10-fold or so over the long term,” he said.Dozen ContendersCurrently, a dozen companies are developing landers and lunar vehicles, mainly through NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program. One leading company in this sector, Masten Space Systems Inc., filed for bankruptcy in July. The firm received a $4.5 million bankruptcy auction-opening bid from space robotics tech developer Astrobotic Technology Inc. in August.Debacles in space programs aren’t rare, and for its part, ispace has already had a brush with failure. It was one of the finalists in Google’s Lunar XPrize, a $20 million award for the first privately funded team to land on the moon, travel 500 meters (1,640 feet) and beam high-definition video back to Earth. The competition concluded without a winner, but the teams, including ispace, have persisted with their efforts.“There are a million ways space missions can go wrong and only one way to go right,” Quilty Analytics’ Henry said, noting it’s hard to predict whether ispace’s launch will be successful. “While this is an exciting field, it remains a difficult business financially and technologically.”Jumpei Nozaki, ispace’s chief financial officer, is well aware of the risks. In an interview, he stressed that a successful landing is not the only goal and the performance of each and every stage will be assessed.Hakamada said he can see the formula for success in Musk’s SpaceX, which has executed projects repeatedly undeterred by setbacks. He’s about to face his biggest test soon when he steps into the space center to witness the take-off.“I was told that your life changes after watching the launch in person,” he said. “It’s going to be an exciting and nervous moment.”(Updates with lander’s current location in 11th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYeezy Roller Coaster Ended With Two-Minute Phone Call at AdidasFast Fashion Waste Is Choking Developing Countries With Mountains of TrashThese Five Women Are Helping Doctors Crack the Long-Covid MysteryA Practical Way to Make Sense of All the Shocks Hammering the Global EconomyHow China Dominates the Elements of a Greener Economy©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. AES (AES) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.56 a share, just three days from its upcoming earnings release on November 3, 2022.AES has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.42%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.56 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.54.AES is part of a big group of Utilities stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at FirstEnergy (FE) as well.FirstEnergy, which is readying to report earnings on February 9, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.54 a share, and FE is 101 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FirstEnergy is $0.53, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.89%.Story continuesAES and FE's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

While the Occupy Wall Street protests initially began as a way to oppose the level of money involved in politics and income inequality, with references to the elite 1% holding much of the country's wealth, their ire soon turned to banks and major corporations. However, the protests did not sustain and, after beginning in 2011, faded by 2012.After the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the world, lockdowns were imposed in most countries around the globe and economies came to a standstill, with most business either shut down, or running on a vastly reduced scale. This led to companies laying of millions across the globe, with the hardest hit industries such as the travel industry laying off the most people, with major companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) each laying off thousands of employees. Many companies also considered this an opportunity to lay off employees and reduce costs despite record profits, with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:WWE) one of such companies, laying off dozens of talent despite being at its most profitable.Most Admired Companies in the world in 2022However, the pandemic provided an opportunity to employees which resulted in an improvement in work-life balance in their lives. Many are now refusing to work unless it's completely remote, citing the reduced expenses because of not having to commute, not to mention the invaluable time saved. As the economy rebounded, many businesses realized that they needed more employees to run operations smoothly, only for employees to have realized their self-worth in the meanwhile and not being willing to go back to work under the same conditions that they'd been subjected to earlier. This has also led to the Great Resignation, an ongoing economic trend where employees are resigning en masse, starting in April 2021, where in the United States, more than four million resigned from their jobs, followed by 3.9 million resignations in June 2021.Story continuesThe demand of the employees is similar regardless of class, background and level of experience; better work-life balance, more flexibility and better compensation. According to a study carried out by PwC, 65% of employees said they were looking for a new job while 88% of executives admitted that the rate of turnover in their companies was higher than normal.Companies seem to be coming to the realization that the days of employee loyalty is over, as it should be, and that they need to do a lot more to improve relations between executives and employees. Further, companies are also significantly under fire due to their contributions to climate change. A 2017 report by the Guardian stated that just 100 companies across the world were responsible for 71% of global emissions, which the companies try to cover by attempting to transfer the onus to regular people, as if they're not to blame. In an effort to improve their image, many companies, including of course the most admired companies in the world, are attempting to rectify their contribution to climate change, often pledging to become carbon neutral or at least significantly reducing their carbon emissions over the next decade or two.The most admired companies in the world are also some of the most recognizable. These companies have long realized the importance of retaining and attracting top talent and creating and maintaining and image that has won them plaudits all over the world. We have used Fortune's annual ranking based on corporate reputation for 2021, with the rankings determined from responses from more than 3,700 executives, directors and analysts. These rankings don't insinuate that these are the most ethical companies free from any misdeeds plaguing them, which we'll cover more when talking about each company, but are simply an indication of the reputation and standing of the company. This is why some medical companies have climbed within the list since they've been on the forefront in the battle against the deadliest pandemic in a century. However, while we've chosen the top 20 from Fortune, we have then checked Google Trend statistics for each company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the most admired companies in the world, starting with number 20:20. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, which has been essential and integral in allowing the resumption of normal activities across the globe. While Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was nowhere near the top 20 in the previous year, now it kicks off the list of most admired companies in the world as it led by example, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has perhaps been integral in dissipating some of the mistrust the general population has towards the biggest pharmaceutical companies.19. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest conglomerates in the United States. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been much maligned for cancer causing talc-based baby powder and was ordered to pay $2.1 billion to the plaintiffs, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of the few companies to develop a valid Covid-19 vaccine, which was instrumental in curbing the pandemic.18. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is famous for selling quality items for lower prices and has gained admirers for its focus on sustainability and environmental, social and governance issues by setting measurable goals with the aim to to improve consistently. One of Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent initiatives includes investing $100 million into Black communities in an effort to combat racism and racial inequality.17. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being considered an admired company will definitely rankle some feathers. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has faced a ton of lawsuits based on poor working conditions, low wages, poor health care and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being involved in antiunion activities. The fact that it's still in this list speaks volumes about the disconnect between executives and average employees.16. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Topping the list of the most admired companies in the world for Fortune is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), though it only made it to 16th position in our list.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is constantly recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world as well. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has topped every category used by Fortune in its determination including use of corporate assets, innovation, social responsibility, financial soundness, quality of management, quality of products and services and global competitiveness.15. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), run by the legendary Warren Buffett, is admired primarily because of the way its been run by the famous investor. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is the largest financial services company in the world by revenue.14. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies in the world. In fact, odds are if you're reading this article on a laptop, you're using Microsoft Windows to run your computer! Regularly rated as one of the best places to work at, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) encourages creativity and is held in high regards by its employees.13. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the biggest chains in the world, with more than 33,000 stores globally. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) also pays full time tuition for all eligible partners in Arizona State University's online program, with more than 1,000 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) partners having graduated through the program. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) aims to have more than 25,000 partners obtain a degree from ASU by 2025. However, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also opposed the formation of unions.12. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)The most admired delivery company in the world, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has been a part of Fortune's list for at least 22 years. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has more than 850,000 employees worldwide, and despite allegations of distributed substances and narcotics not to mention allegations of tax evasion, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has still been able to maintain its view as an admired company.11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few major retailers which has actually been praised by current and ex-employees. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) may not have unions in the majority of locations but 15,000 employees are union members. Further, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has continuously raised the minimum wage of its workers, which is now $16 an hour.10. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world today, with more than 220 million subscribers across the globe. While making the list of the most admired companies in the world, it is unlikely that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be maintaining its ranking considering its poor performance recently losing subscribers while letting go 300 employees in June. Netflix Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has also seen its share price decline by 61% YTD in 2022.9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being among the most admired companies in the world is definitely going to be controversial, what with the internet being full of stories of the way Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) mistreats its workers, busts unions and tries to stifle worker rights in multiple instances, the truth is that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is still really admired because of its innovation for customers, support for communities and commitment to the environment. Of course, it's worth noting that it is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) itself which has mentioned the above reasons.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)One of the biggest sports goods manufacturers in the world, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has an incredibly strong brand reputation and brand loyalty, which has served it through decades. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)  is also famous for its innovation and creativity, though it does need to do more in terms of social responsibility.7. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL)While Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) infamously became the face of poor customer service after it dragged off a doctor from the plane in 2017, but to its credit, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) did reviews its policies after the incident to improve upon services provided.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is the most admired media and entertainment company in the world.

""While we are disappointed by these results, our performance in the third quarter does not reflect what the business is capable of delivering or our opportunities for the future. We have since put these non-recurring items behind us and have taken corrective actions to remedy the operating issues. Third quarter bookings, however, were exceptionally strong with large project awards in our traditional markets, solid aftermarket and MRO activity, and numerous awards driven by our 3D growth strategy. Our current project funnel remains healthy and includes significant opportunities in energy transition and energy security.""Rowe concluded, ""We look to close out the year with significant sequential revenue growth and improved margins given the one-time nature of most of the factors that impacted our third quarter performance. We continue to make progress on our efforts to mitigate supply chain headwinds that have challenged our revenue conversion this year and are implementing new cost reduction measures to improve efficiency and address underutilization at certain facilities. With our highest backlog in seven years, increased spending in our traditional markets driven by energy security concerns and continued progress and momentum in our 3D strategy, we believe Flowserve is positioned to deliver sequential revenue growth and earnings improvement for the remainder of the year and for full-year 2023.""2022 Fourth Quarter Guidance3Flowserve expects 2022 fourth quarter Reported and Adjusted EPS of at least 40 cents on year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of approximately 8-10%. Additionally, several of the issues that impacted the third quarter, including business disruption due to an ERP conversion, discrete one-time accounting issues, the purchase of R&amp;D and elevated bad debt expenses are not expected to recur in the fourth quarter.

Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $42 million, or 5%. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $74 million, or 9%. Price realization had a favorable impact of 13%, with increases across all regions in response to the current inflationary environment. Volumes decreased by 4%, driven by food retail market declines across the Americas and EMEA regions and the adverse impact from prior supply disruptions. Adjusted EBITDA of $185 million, or 22.3% of net sales, increased 9% from $169 million, or 21.2% of net sales. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to favorable net price realization and productivity improvements, partially offset by lower volumes.Third quarter net sales in Protective were $571 million, a decrease of 6% as reported. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $29 million, or 5%, while the divestiture of Reflectix, Inc. had an unfavorable impact of $12 million, or 2%. On an organic basis, net sales increased $2 million, with price realization having a favorable impact of $76 million, or 12%, with increases realized across all regions in response to the current inflationary environment.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ), News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWS), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) are some of the leading companies that pay dividends on either an annual or semi-annual basis.Of the thousands of companies on the U.S. stock market that make dividend payments to shareholders, the vast majority do so either monthly or quarterly. In fact, there are so few companies that make dividend payments on an annual basis that we had to include a few companies that make semi-annual payments (which are slightly less rare, though still uncommon) to fill out our list.More frequent dividend payout schedules can be advantageous for investors, allowing them to reinvest their payments sooner or giving them a steady flow of income. Some of the best dividend stocks on the market make less frequent payments though and shouldn’t be overlooked. If nothing else, stocks that make annual dividend payments are easier to trade in and out of if you’re just looking to stockpile dividend payments.There are a number of reasons why a company may choose to make dividend payments less frequently. For some companies, the seasonality of their business model may dictate that the majority of their earnings are accrued during a small stretch of the year, which may incentivize them to make dividend payments during only those periods. In other cases, broader cash flow concerns may prompt a company to make less frequent payments so they can better manage short downturns in their income streams.That’s not to say any of the following stocks aren’t necessarily safe dividend stocks. That all comes down to the company’s overall payout ratio and future cash flow projections, which we’ll dig into when analyzing each of them in turn. That said, several of them are smaller companies with less robust dividend payment histories and limited institutional support, so that’s worth considering before making any investment decision.Story continuesThe following list of top annual dividend stocks includes all of the companies’ relevant dividend history, including payout rates, payout ratios, the latest changes to their dividend policies, and the schedule for their upcoming payments.12 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy NowImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from PixabayOur MethodologyThe following annual dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.

A compelling semi-annual dividend payer is IF Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:IROQ), which has grown its dividend at a CAGR of 15.8% over the last five years, having more than doubled its annual payouts since 2017.A bank holding company that manages the business activities of personal and commercial bank Iroquois Federal, IF Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:IROQ) grew net income to $1.84 per diluted share in the company’s FY22 ended June 30, up from $1.74 a year earlier. Return on average equity jumped 73 basis points during the company’s fiscal Q4 to 7.07%. While it may not be able to sustain its current dividend growth rate longer-term, with a yield already above 2%, IROQ shares are an interesting under-the-radar dividend pick.Just a lone hedge fund was long IF Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:IROQ) on June 30, that being Jeffrey Gendell’s Tontine Asset Management, which owned 251,679 shares worth $4.78 million. In over ten years of tracking the stock’s hedge fund ownership, it’s never had less than one or more than two shareholders during any given quarter.11. Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (NYSE:CPAC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 1 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.5276 Peruvian cement company Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (NYSE:CPAC) has made an annual or special dividend payments over each of the last ten years. Its next payment is scheduled for December 12 with an ex-dividend date of November 11. The company’s dividend payout ratio is hovering above 90%, so the dividend is unlikely to go much higher from here, especially with analysts predicting the company’s EPS will fall by 13% to $0.34 next year. With a yield of nearly 10% though, its dividend doesn’t need continued growth to be a compelling micro-cap dividend play.Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (NYSE:CPAC) grew operating income by 7.6% in the September quarter, reaching just under $90 million. Revenue grew by just over 9% to $554 million, slightly outpacing the company’s cost of revenue, which rose by 8%.There was also just a lone hedge fund long Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (NYSE:CPAC) on June 30, Jim Simons’ quant fund Renaissance Technologies, which owned a paltry 12,464 shares, which it bought during the second quarter. Prior to that, there hadn’t been a fund long CPAC since the first quarter of 2018, which also happened to be Renaissance Technologies with a similarly small stake.10. G. Willi-Food International Limited (NASDAQ:WILC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 2 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.87 After making a single dividend payment last year, G. Willi-Food International Limited (NASDAQ:WILC) officially began making semi-annual payments this year, which totaled $0.87, giving WILC shares a yield of 6.43%. G. Willi-Food International Limited (NASDAQ:WILC) has become much more profitable in recent years, which has allowed the company to begin rewarding shareholders with payouts.The Israel-based food products distributor rarely topped $0.50 in EPS between 2009 and 2018 and never earned more than 0.79 per share. It’s topped $1.00 in EPS over each of the last three years however, including $1.21 in 2020. It’s also had its two best years in terms of EBITDA over each of the last two years, pulling in $20 million and $18 million respectively.The same two funds have been long G. Willi-Food International Limited (NASDAQ:WILC) dating back seven quarters: Jim Simon’s Renaissance Technologies and Brian Gaines’ Springhouse Capital Management. The latter has held a stake in the company since late 2015, while RenTech’s ownership stretches back to at least 2010.9. Sasol Limited (NYSE:SSL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 5 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.8578 After halting its semi-annual dividend payments in 2019, South African energy and chemicals company Sasol Limited (NYSE:SSL) relaunched an annual dividend this year, which paid out $0.8578 on September 23, giving shares a yield of close to 5%. The latest payout was well beneath the company’s historical annual payments, and could rise in the years to come.Sasol Limited (NYSE:SSL)’s net income has quadrupled in the last year to $2.7 billion, which the company has primarily used to pay down its mountain of debt, which was partly incurred due to massive cost overruns in the building of its Lake Charles Chemicals Project in Louisiana. With that project complete and the company’s balance sheet rebounding, shareholders could be the big beneficiaries of all that net income in the years to come.Hedge fund ownership of Sasol Limited (NYSE:SSL) has been cut in half since the end of 2020, with Donald Sussman’s Paloma Partners and Israel Englander’s Millennium Management among the funds to sell off SSL during that time. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clark, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital owns the largest position in Sasol as of June 30, holding 2.25 million shares.8. Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (NASDAQ:SHEN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 6 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.08 Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (NASDAQ:SHEN) slashed its annual dividend payments from $0.34 to $0.07 last year after the telecommunications company sold off its wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) for $1.95 billion as it shifts to a fiber-first strategy. $937 million of that windfall was distributed to shareholders through a special dividend last year.Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (NASDAQ:SHEN) shareholders won’t have the benefit of such a special payout this year however, though the annual dividend was hiked ever so slightly to $0.08. The company, which operates in six U.S. states, had grown revenue by nearly 18% over the past five years, but will now operate with a narrower focus that the company believes will pay off in the long-term. Q2 revenue was $66 million, topping estimates, while the company registered a $0.06 loss per share in earnings.Hedge funds have been bailing on Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (NASDAQ:SHEN) in droves in recent years, with ownership of the stock falling by 70% since the middle of 2019. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment owns 250,979 shares of SHEN as of June 30 after selling off 57% of its holding during Q2.7. RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 9 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.6245 RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX) makes semi-annual variable dividend payments, which amounted to $0.6255 since this year, down from $0.6673 last year. The shares of the British analytics company have a solid dividend yield of 2.29% and the company has made dividend payments for 13 consecutive years.RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX) announced in earlier this month that it expects its FY22 profit to be above historical trends thanks to strong performances from its risk, scientific, technical &amp; medical business, but particularly from its exhibitions business, which had an 85% year-over-year boost in underlying revenue growth thanks to live events recovering from pandemic restrictions. RELX’s net income grew by 14.6% in the June quarter.RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX) is sitting at an all-time high in hedge fund ownership, with more than double the amount of funds being long the company on June 30 as there were five quarters earlier. Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp and Israel Englander’s Millennium Management are two prominent funds that have built stakes in RELX in recent quarters.6. National Western Life Group Inc. (NASDAQ:NWLI)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 12 Annual Dividend Payout: $0.36 The first part of the list is closed out by National Western Life Group Inc. (NASDAQ:NWLI), which has a remarkable, if somewhat auspicious track record of annual dividend payments. The company has made the same $0.36 annual payment to its shareholders every year since 2006. Unfortunately for the company’s long-term shareholders, the stock itself has seen about the same amount of share price growth during that 17-year span, being down by 4.3% since the end of 2005.National Western Life Group Inc. (NASDAQ:NWLI), which is the parent company of an insurance company which itself is the parent company of another insurance company (yes, things can and have gotten even weirder on the NWLI front), delivered consolidated net earnings of $18.93 per diluted Class A share during the first half of 2022, down from $31.68 a year earlier. The company had consolidated total assets of $13.3 billion as of June 30.There was a big jump in hedge fund ownership of National Western Life Group Inc. (NASDAQ:NWLI) during the third quarter of 2021 and ownership of the stock has remained at elevated positions in the quarters since. Paul J. Isaac’s Arbiter Partners Capital Management owns the most bullish NWLI stake among the funds tracked by our database, having 2.37% 13F exposure to the stock through owning 18,824 shares.CRH plc (NYSE:CRH), News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWS), and Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) are some higher profile annual dividend stocks for investors to consider, check them out at the link below. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Invest In11 Best UK Stocks To Buy Now11 Best Dividend Stocks Under $5 Disclosure: None. 12 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

The government argued the deal should be stopped because it would lead to less competition for blockbuster books and lower advances for authors who earn $250,000 or more.Penguin Random House said the decision was ""unfortunate,"" and said it would ""immediately request an expedited appeal.""""A merger would be good for competition,"" said Thomas Rabe, chief executive of Penguin owner Bertelsmann, who said the court's decision was based on incorrect basic assumptions.Penguin writers include cookbook author Ina Garten and novelists Zadie Smith and Danielle Steele, while Simon &amp; Schuster publishes Stephen King, Jennifer Weiner and Hillary Rodham Clinton, among others.Penguin is owned by Bertelsmann, a German media group, while Paramount Global owns Simon &amp; Schuster.""The proposed merger would have reduced competition, decreased author compensation, diminished the breadth, depth, and diversity of our stories and ideas, and ultimately impoverished our democracy,"" U.S. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said in a statement.The U.S. Justice Department had filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal in November 2021.In hearings held in August, the government argued that the largest five publishers control 90% of the market, and a combined Penguin and Simon &amp; Schuster would control nearly half of the market for publishing rights to blockbuster books while its nearest competitors would be less than half its size.Story continuesPenguin Random House lawyer Daniel Petrocelli, who defeated the government in a previous merger challenge, argued during the trial that the deal would have ""enormous benefits"" for readers and authors alike because the imprints, or brands, owned by the two giants would continue to compete against each other.Best-selling author Stephen King, who testified during the three-week trial, took issue with this pledge. ""You might as well say you're going to have a husband and wife bidding against each other for the same house. It's kind of ridiculous,"" King told the court.The top five publishers are Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette, with Walt Disney Co and Amazon.com Inc also in the market. HarperCollins is owned by News Corp.Pan was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by President Joe Biden, who then nominated her to the appeals court in Washington. She was confirmed in September. (Reporting by Diane Bartz; editing by Leslie Adler and Jason Neely)]"

61,b8669a4c-fbc9-3cc2-a47a-e6beac3ce95a,MSI,2022-11-01,"Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) jumps 10% this week, though earnings growth is still tracking behind five-year shareholder returns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/motorola-solutions-nyse-msi-jumps-150313682.html,1667228593,STORY,['MSI'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 165% in five years. And in the last month, the share price has gained 12%. But the price may well have benefitted from a buoyant market, since stocks have gained 7.6% in the last thirty days.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Motorola Solutions achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 22% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Motorola Solutions' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Motorola Solutions' TSR for the last 5 years was 187%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Motorola Solutions shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 2.0% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 24% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

MSI is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 10.7%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.2%, on average.The Chicago, IL-based company is expected to have recorded year-over-year higher revenues on the back of growth in both segments — Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. It benefits from the increasing demand for its mission-critical technologies in North America and globally.Factors at PlayDuring the quarter, Motorola inked a contract with Parana Public Safety Secretariat to augment the public-safety communications system in Parana, Brazil. The contract will upgrade the legacy communications network of the Latin American country’s police agencies and help them to better coordinate for mission-critical applications. Per the deal, Motorola will enable advanced digitally encrypted radio communications based on the P25 standard for a secure and resilient private communications system to support public safety.In the third quarter, Motorola signed a deal with the Romanian National Administration of Penitentiaries for 2100 body-worn cameras for use across all the prisons in the country. Its state-of-the-art VB400 body-worn cameras enable the capture of incidents from the start as it offers an automated pre-recording feature. The VideoManager evidence management solution enables a highly advanced solution for protecting the evidence present on video. It also proves useful to officers’ daily workflow.Riding on such state-of-the-art products, Motorola expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. These systems drive the demand for additional device sales and promote software upgrades and infrastructure expansion. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks related to critical communications operations. These developments are expected to have positively impacted its performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Products and Systems Integration segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,427 million. The figure indicates a rise from $1,325 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter, Motorola inked a five-year contract extension worth $41.9 million with the New South Wales Telecommunications Authority to enhance the development of its Public Safety Network. MSI’s suite of public safety services, which encompass network lifecycle upgrades alongside 24x7 cybersecurity features, will offer secure and seamless performance for mission-critical applications. This is likely to be reflected in the upcoming results. The consensus estimate for Services and Software revenues is $871 million, which indicates growth from the year-ago figure of $782 million.For the September quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2,313 million, which indicates growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $2,107 million. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at $2.88, which suggests an increase from $2.35 recorded in the prior-year quarter driven by top-line growth.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Motorola in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%, with both pegged at $2.88.

Companies reported slowing growth, headwinds from the strong USD, and rising costs. While the broader market shrugged off the news, the Nasdaq lagged as some of its largest components fell by more than 10%.Alphabet faces ad spending slowdownAlphabet’s ( Nasdaq: GOOGL ) revenue of $57.27 billion was slightly lower than expected, while year-over-year growth fell to 6%, the slowest rate since June 2020. EPS were also lower than expected at $1.06 vs the $1.25 consensus estimate. YouTube’s revenue fell for the first time since its numbers have been reported separately.Our take: Alphabet is primarily an advertising business, and ad spending is cyclical  - ie. it rises and falls with the business cycle. So it isn’t really surprising to see revenue growth slowing down in the current economic environment. For context, the third quarter last year - against which this quarter is being measured - was one of the best quarters in the company’s history. Revenue is up 75% since the start of the pandemic.The important question for investors: What is the likely growth rate over the next 5 to 10 years? Over the last decade, revenues grew at around 20% a year, and it's probably unrealistic to expect such a big company to keep that up.Analyst forecasts are fairly consistent with their estimates and see revenues growing at 11% a year going forward. If that turns out to be correct the stock ticks all the Simply Wall St valuation boxes - click on the image below for more details.Microsoft warns of rising costs and revenue headwinds aheadMicrosoft’s  ( Nasdaq: MSFT ) Q1 2023 results were better than expected and in line with management’s previous guidance. Overall revenue increased by 11% year-on-year to $50.1 billion. Adjusted EPS fell 13.5% to $2.35 which was slightly better than expected.Story continuesThe cloud business is still the growth driver, while revenue for the ‘more personal computing’ segment which includes Windows licensing, devices, and gaming, increased by just 3%.NasdaqGS: MSFT Segment Results 26th October 2022 - from Microsoft Earnings PresentationBut, it was the company’s guidance for the next quarter that caused investors to sell the stock, which closed 7.8% lower on Wednesday. The company said it expects continued pressure from the PC market to weigh on revenue growth. The company also sees growth in the cloud segment slowing slightly. In addition, the company expects operating costs to increase by 17 to 18%.Our take: Microsoft is facing margin pressure in the next quarter and one of the reasons for that is the combined effect of inflation and the strong USD. About half of Microsoft’s revenue comes from outside the US, and that revenue is worth less in dollars. At the same time operating expenses, which are mostly in USD, are rising with inflation. If the USD happens to reverse during the next quarter, net income and margins would be better than the current guidance suggests.So far companies like Microsoft and Alphabet haven't brought up cost cutting - but that could change if margins remain under pressure. And that would have knock-on effects throughout the economy.Meta’s Big, Virtual BetThere was more pain for Meta ( Nasdaq: META ) shareholders as the stock price fell as much as 25% after the company reported slower revenue growth and rising costs. Year-on-year revenue growth fell by 4% and EPS were down 49%.The company's ad business is facing a slowing market for ad spending and increased competition. At the same time, adding and even keeping users is very difficult for platforms that already count nearly 30% of the world's population as users.Our take: Meta’s legacy assets (mainly being Facebook and Instagram) are still very profitable. Operating income for the trailing 12-month period has fallen by 25% in the last year, but it’s still a massive $35 bln. But the company has invested most of that in AI and Reality Labs (ie. the Metaverse) with capital expenditure rocketing from $17 bln to $27 bln, and set to rise to $33 bln next year.This really is an all-in bet, which could pay off in spectacular fashion - or bomb.Amazon: Slowing Growth and Little in the Way of ProfitsAmazon’s  ( Nasdaq: AMZN ) revenue growth during its third quarter was slightly lower than expected, while EPS were well above consensus estimates. Revenue growth for AWS was a little slower than expected, while ad revenue was higher than expected and notable given what Meta and Alphabet have experienced.Amazon warned that it expects revenue growth in the fourth quarter to slow to between 2 and 4%, and also said it expects a weaker holiday shopping period.NASDAQ: AMZN Free Cash Flow Source: Company results presentationOur take: Amazon’s share price fell as much as 15%, which many have attributed to the weak guidance and slowing growth at AWS. But, Amazon’s profitability is something that may also be frustrating investors.In 2021 Amazon increased its investment in fulfillment capacity which resulted in the free cash flow margin falling to the lowest level in a decade. In May this year, the company suggested the current investment cycle was slowing down, which presumably meant margins should start improving. That hasn’t really been the case - Capex is still high and free cash flow is still negative.Apple: Cash is KingApple ( Nasdaq: AAPL ) was the only Big Tech company to survive unscathed, and with good reason. Fourth-quarter revenue and EPS were slightly better than expected, and revenue and EPS for the last 12 months were both up around 8%.Performance from individual business segments was mixed, but largely in line with what analysts expected. Revenue from iPhones, iPads, and services was slightly lower than expected, while revenue from Macs and other products was also better than expected.Our take:  Apple is an incredibly profitable business, having generated over $90 billion in free cash flow over the last year. But, as it stands right now, growth forecasts are low for the next few years and aren’t expected to get back to double digits until 2028.The share is currently trading on a price multiple of 24.8x which is reasonable based on historical growth rates, but very high if we assume the current forecasts are correct. If growth isn’t higher than expected, returns could be disappointing for the next few years.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

This is expected to have helped Cognizant earn market share in the healthcare industry and increase revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Microsoft has also been helping Cognizant address the cloud transformation megatrend in the insurance sector.CTSH’s third-quarter 2022 results are expected to reflect the positive effects of a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.2, as the delivery team met the demand with adequate supply despite unfavorable labor market conditions.Story continuesHowever, the company has reduced its cc outlook for revenues by 250 basis points to reflect the rising volatility in foreign exchange due to geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic turmoil.Operating costs are expected to have increased in the to-be-reported quarter due to rising compensation costs, return to office costs, and rising selling, general and administrative cost. This is expected to have hurt Cognizant’s bottom line in the third quarter. Industry supply-chain constraints are also expected to have negatively impacted the company’s growth in the to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model SaysPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

71,9e3f0e5a-c407-31f4-95f0-157bcea8e0c9,WBA,2022-11-01,15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-nasdaq-dividend-stocks-130315145.html,1667307795.0,STORY,"['SWKS', 'EXCVV', 'NTES', 'KDP', 'FAST', 'WBA', 'INTC', 'SBUX', 'PAYX', 'EBAY', 'KHC', 'GILD']","[In this article we present the list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are just a handful of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, which we’ll examine in this article.The NASDAQ index isn’t typically known for its high-dividend paying stocks. In fact, some of the most prominent companies that make up the index, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), fail to pay any dividend at all.The NASDAQ 100 index’s dividend yield stands at just a hair above 1%, which is rather paltry when compared to the companies that make up the Dow Jones index, which yields more than twice that at 2.27%. The average dividend yield of the companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index also stands at a far more robust 1.8%.Those figures aren’t totally surprising given the makeup of many of the companies on those indexes. While the Dow and S&amp;P are known for boasting many mature companies that have stable cash flows that make them safe dividend stock picks, the same can’t be said of the NASDAQ, which features many young tech companies that are still in their high-growth stages.Those dynamics are also apparent in the performance of those indexes this year. While the Dow shot up by 800 points on October 28 and has registered four straight weeks of gains, the NASDAQ has continued to flounder for the most part, down 30% year-to-date, though it has gained 7% in the last two weeks. With investors being bearish and looking to the defensive side of the market to get them through the current economic environment, high-growth tech companies that lose money are rarely on the menu.Some of the best dividend stocks on the market can be found in the NASDAQ however, with yields that top 2% and steady income streams to support not only their current dividend payouts, but continued dividend growth as well. Notably, many of them are not traditional NASDAQ tech stocks, though several prominent tech heavyweights also feature on the list.Story continuesWe’ll take a look at all of those top dividend stocks in this article, which feature yields above 2%. We’ll also look into their cash flow situation, dividend history, and more, to get a sense of how suitable an investment they are.15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Our MethodologyThe following NASDAQ dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy15. NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 Dividend Yield: 2.8% Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) are some of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, a label which also applies to Chinese video game giant NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES). The company, which develops and publishes PC MMORPGs and mobile games, including Diablo Immortal in China, has a variable dividend policy based on the previous quarter’s earnings. NetEase’s most recent quarterly dividend grew by 12% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the company’s five year dividend growth rate of 12.1%.NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has been facing some headwinds in China, most notably from the Chinese government, which didn’t approve any of its games for release for over a year as it seeks to crack down on videogame addiction in the country. NetEase was finally issued a license for a new game in September, but more importantly, Diablo Immortal was also released in Q3 after a slight delay, which should help offset any slowdown in its other titles.Hedge fund ownership of NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has slumped heavily over the last year, falling by 41% during that time to hit a four-year low. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates were some of the biggest money managers to sell off their NTES positions during Q2. William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management held the largest stake among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey on June 30, owning 3.67 million shares.14. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 Dividend Yield: 2.02% Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) raised its dividend by 6.7% in Q4, which also pushed it 33% higher than Q2 of 2021. That’s been a positive development for the company’s dividend investors, which had been saddled with a flat dividend for ten straight quarters prior to Q3 2021. KDP shares currently yield just over 2% and the dividend is well supported, with the company’s payout ratio being less than 50%.Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) deliver adjusted EPS of $0.46 in Q3 alongside revenue of $3.62 billion, results that were in line with expectations. The company also reaffirmed its FY22 revenue and EPS guidance, which called for low-double-digit growth in the former and mid-single-digit growth in the latter. With the company seemingly overcoming the supply chain challenges that hampered its coffee business earlier this year, it expects strong sales and earnings growth from the business in Q4.Hedge fund ownership of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) spiked during the third quarter of 2020 but immediately fell back to baseline during the following quarter, where it’s remained since. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors opened a 1.89 million shares position in KDP during Q2, while Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management raised its stake in the company by 150% during the quarter to 1.63 million shares.13. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 30 Dividend Yield: 3.71% American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) is growing its dividend by 6.4% in Q4, pushing its yield to 3.71%. The company has grown its dividend for 12 straight years and has a very manageable payout ratio of 62%. AEP is transitioning to cleaner energy systems that the company believes will support long-term earnings growth. Its Q3 operating EPS was $1.62, beating estimates by $0.06, while its $5.5 billion in revenue topped estimates by a hearty $750 million.Hedge fund ownership of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) has dipped for three straight quarters, dropping by 21% during that time. Joel Greenblatt’s Gotham Asset Management and Peter Muller’s PDT Partners were among the funds to sell out of their AEP positions during Q2. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies held the largest position on June 30 at 1.03 million shares.ClearBridge Investments owns 780,980 shares of AEP as of June 30 and likes American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)’s aggressive renewables ramp, adding the stock to its portfolio during Q1 and discussing it in the ClearBridge Investments Value Equity Q1 2022 investor letter:“About 5% of the portfolio is in transitioning power companies, typically migrating from coal to renewables. We have been active in encouraging these transitions and added a new position in American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP). AEP has the fastest planned renewable energy ramp in the U.S., with plans to both shrink coal and grow renewables by 50% each by 2030. This would drive an 80% emissions reduction, while supporting high single-digit earnings growth at a double-digit return.”12. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 32 Dividend Yield: 3.48% Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)’s dividend was cut by 11.1% this year and has largely stagnated for several years, with it currently paying out less than it was in 2018. With a solid yield and payout ratio under 50%, it’s still a dividend worth considering, especially given that it should benefit from the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act. BMO Capital analyst James Thalacker has an ‘Outperform” rating on EXC shares and believes the company is well positioned to achieve multiple expansion.There was a big sell off of Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) by hedge funds during the first quarter of this year, as there was a 31% drop in ownership of the stock. Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp and Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management were among the funds to unload their EXC positions during Q1. Ownership of the stock remained flat during Q2.ClearBridge Investments, which owns 1.62 million EXC shares as of June 30, believes Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is starting to be viewed as a premium utility, as revealed in the ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Value Strategy’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. electric utility Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) was also a top contributor. Exelon is a pure transmission and distribution regulated utility business serving millions of electric and gas customers across Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Shares outperformed along with the utilities sector; Exelon is also starting to be viewed as a premium name after its recently completed spin-off of power generation business Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG).”11. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 33 Dividend Yield: 2.55% Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) grew its dividend by 10.7% this year, marking its 24th straight year of dividend growth and positioning the company to join the select group of Dividend Aristocrats next year. The company has grown its dividend at a strong CAGR of 14.1% over the past five years, which has pushed the stock’s yield above 2.5%. The company’s payout ratio is just under 65%.Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) reported Q3 revenue and EPS of $1.8 billion and $0.50 respectively, which were largely in line with estimates, though topping them slightly. Net sales were up by 16% year-over-year during Q3, including 21.4% year-over-year growth in August. Argus analyst John Eade has a ‘Buy’ rating on FAST shares and believes the company can generate high-single-digit EPS growth over the long-term, which should support continued dividend growth.There was a 17% jump in hedge fund ownership of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) during Q2. Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management built a large stake in the company of 1.14 million shares during Q2, while Israel Englander’s Millennium Management hiked its position by 1,174% to 973,277 shares.10. Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 37 Dividend Yield: 2.64% Payroll and HR services provider Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has been steadily growing its earnings for the last decade and the company is starting to get more aggressive with its dividend as a result, raising it by 19.7% in the second quarter of this year. PAYX shares now yield a solid 2.64%, though the company’s payout ratio is slightly high at just under 75%.Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has grown its earnings at close to an 11% clip on an annualized basis over the past five years and the company expects more of the same in FY23, predicting 11% to 12% earnings growth, so it should have no problem continuing to grow its dividend as it’s done for the past seven years. The company’s Q1 FY23 EPS was $1.03, beating estimates by $0.06.There’s been a 37% jump in the number of smart money managers long Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) during the past five quarters, as hedge funds become increasingly intrigued by the company’s growing customer base. Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group owns 2.14 million PAYX shares as of June 30, the largest stake in the company among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey.9. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 2.82% Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) grew its dividend by 10.7% in the third quarter of this year, which represented slowing growth compared to its dividend’s 15.5% CAGR over the past five years. With a payout ratio of just over 20%, Skyworks should have no trouble maintaining double digit dividend growth in the years to come.The radiofrequency device manufacturer is expanding its offerings across multiple markets in the wake of the possibility that it will lose its biggest customer Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the years to come. Its revenue from non-mobile phone products grew by 38% year-over-year in Q2 to account for 38% of the company’s revenue, so it’s on the right track.Hedge fund ownership of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) was flat during the second quarter but is down by 24% since the third quarter of 2020 as hedge funds increasingly shy away from semiconductor stocks during the current cycle. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management also unloaded her SWKS stake during Q3.Heartland Advisors, which owns 119,628 shares of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) as of June 30, discussed how cheap the stock has become in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”8. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 5.25% Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is a Dividend Aristocrat, pushing towards 30 consecutive years of dividend growth. Its dividend inched up to $0.48 in Q3 and has grown at less than a 5% CAGR over the past five years, but with a yield that’s already above 5%, its shares should nonetheless be attractive to dividend investors. While Walgreens’ payout ratio is under 40%, its profit margins are also slim, which could cause issues if its expansion into the primary care field doesn’t pan out.Hedge fund ownership of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) trended down heavily between 2015 and 2019, falling by more than half during that time, and was remained relatively flat since. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management owns 2.83 million WBA shares as of June 30, having 4.64% 13F exposure to the stock.Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity, which sold out of its Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2, discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”7. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Dividend Yield: 4.11% The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) slashed its dividend by 36% in 2019 and it’s been flat ever since, so investors shouldn’t count on it growing any time soon, especially with the company’s margins being heavily pressured in Q2. Still, with a yield above 4% thanks to KHC shares cratering over the past five years, it may be an opportune time to for investors to add a good defensive dividend stock to their portfolios.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) surged its prices by 12.4% in Q2 but margins still fell by more than four percentage points year-over-year to just over 30% and sales volumes fell by over 2%. The company’s revenue and adjusted net income did beat estimates in Q3, coming in at $6.5 billion and $0.63 per share respectively, but year-over-year sales volumes fell again, this time by nearly 4%.Hedge fund ownership of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) ticked up by 19% during the second quarter as hedge funds began taking a harder look at quality food producers in an investing environment turning more defensive. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintains the largest stake in KHC as of June 30, owning nearly 326 million shares worth $12.4 billion.6. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 Dividend Yield: 2.18% Closing out the first part of the list is eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), which has already grown its dividend payments by 57% since first instituting them in the second quarter of 2019. The e-commerce platform made its most aggressive dividend hike yet in the first quarter of this year, raising its dividend by 22%. With a yield now topping 2% and a payout ratio of just 20%, eBay is becoming a compelling dividend stock for investors to consider.While the number of active buyers on eBay’s platform fell by 12% year-over-year in Q2, the company’s strong profit margins should ensure continued earnings power for years to come, especially with eBay’s take rate growing by 130 basis points to 12.4%. There’s plenty of room for further growth in that regard, as rival Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)’s take rate is nearly 20%.Hedge fund ownership of eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) dropped by 20% during the first half of 2022 and is less than half what it was eight years ago. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners both sold out of their EBAY stakes during the second quarter.Smead Capital Management, which owns 2.97 million eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) shares as of June 30, discussed the stock’s poor run in Smead Value Fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”Gilead Sciences, Inc.

73,f9a23eac-d47b-3857-8fe3-5849e12df44a,WBA,2022-11-01,Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of $0.48,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-boots-alliance-nasdaq-wba-103314930.html,1667298794.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) will pay a dividend of $0.48 on the 12th of December. This means the annual payment is 5.2% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance Walgreens Boots Alliance's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, prior to this announcement, Walgreens Boots Alliance was quite comfortably covering its dividend with earnings and it was paying more than 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders. However, with more than 75% of free cash flow being paid out to shareholders, future growth could potentially be constrained.EPS is set to fall by 14.9% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 47%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendWalgreens Boots Alliance Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.90 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.92. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 7.9% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Walgreens Boots Alliance Could Grow Its DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Walgreens Boots Alliance has grown earnings per share at 5.7% per year over the past five years. Walgreens Boots Alliance definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.In SummaryIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Walgreens Boots Alliance's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The healthcare industry is evolving, and new trends are emerging. These trends include artificial intelligence being increasingly used by healthcare providers, healthcare becoming more personalized in terms of precision medicines, virtual healthcare becoming mainstream, and mental health being a priority, among others. In healthcare, biotechs are largely on the radar of investors who are on the hunt for low valuations. Some biotech companies, with new clinical data which indicates that their product is on the right path, have been able to raise funds in the market. $5.2 billion was raised in the third quarter, which was higher than the first two quarters combined. Vincent Meunier, a managing director at European investment bank Bryan Garnier &amp; Co, told Financial Times on October 26: “A couple of months ago, cheap was cheap but for good reasons. Now, cheap is appealing.”Demand for dividend stocks is also rising as money managers promote stocks with a history of paying dividends to shareholders, hoping that this strategy will prove to be a safe haven for investors who face big portfolio losses from the broader market. Healthcare has been one of the most prominent S&amp;P 500 segments with a resilient history of distributing dividends, and some of the best stocks to invest in include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Our Methodology We selected the following healthcare dividend stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and robust dividend profiles. The dividend yields as of October 28 have been mentioned. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continues11 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashBest Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now11. Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Dividend Yield as of October 28: 3.90%Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) is a Minnesota-based company providing dental and animal health products in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The company offers biologicals, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, and dental equipment and services. On September 13, Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) declared a $0.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on November 4, to shareholders of record on October 21. On October 17, Piper Sandler analyst Jason Bednar maintained an Overweight rating on Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $35 from $40. The lower multiple is due to reduced peer group multiples, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 20 hedge funds held stakes worth $167.70 million in Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO), compared to 18 funds in the prior quarter worth $143.70 million. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.6 million shares valued at $50.4 million. Like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) is one of the best healthcare dividends stocks to monitor. Here is what Heartland Advisors specifically said about Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO), a leading distributor of dental and animal health related products, reported first quarter results that included a sequential decline in dental equipment-related sales and price deflation in consumables. The former is in part a hangover from a strong fourth quarter while price deflation is being driven by inventory build-ups during COVID. With a healthy 4% dividend yield and attractive valuation, only 11X estimated earnings, we continue to hold Patterson. Notably too, a competitor in the dental space, Henry Schein, Inc., trades at a 1.5x+ premium to PDCO on estimated EBITDA while Covetrus, Inc., an animal health player, was acquired for 14.0x EBITDA in May.”10. Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Dividend Yield as of October 28: 2.39%Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) is a North Carolina-based healthcare improvement company in the United States. The company primarily delivers medical and surgical products, pharmaceuticals, laboratory supplies, capital equipment, clinical engineering, and workforce solutions. Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) on October 21 declared a $0.21 per share quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable on December 15, to shareholders of record on December 1. Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) is one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. On August 24, Benchmark analyst Bill Sutherland raised the price target on Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) to $46 from $44 and kept a Buy rating on the shares following the company’s ""constructive"" FY23 guidance. The analyst was positive on Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC)’s outlook for FY23 and beyond given the high visibility of recently completed renewals of 5 to 7-year GPO contracts which drive significant free cash flow.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 25 hedge funds were bullish on Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) at the end of June 2022, compared to 30 funds in the last quarter. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies held the leading position in the company, comprising 2.74 million shares worth $98 million.  9. Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE:EHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Dividend Yield as of October 28: 1.10%Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE:EHC) was founded in 1983 and is based in Birmingham, Alabama. The company provides facility-based and home-based post-acute healthcare services in the United States.

The dividend is payable on January 17, 2023 to shareholders of the company as of January 3. Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE:EHC) is one of the best dividend stocks to buy now. On October 28, Raymond James analyst John Ransom raised the price target on Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE:EHC) to $72 from $65 and maintained a Strong Buy rating on the shares. Q3 results outperformed on revenue but fell short on EBITDA, primarily due to higher de novo losses, hurricane Ian disruption, and increased labor costs, the analyst told investors. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 34 hedge funds were long Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE:EHC), compared to 43 funds in the earlier quarter. Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.95 million shares worth $165.3 million. 8. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dividend Yield as of October 28: 2.11%Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) is an Illinois-based company that develops a portfolio of healthcare products worldwide. The company offers dialysis therapies and services, intravenous therapies, infusion pumps, drug reconstitution devices, and oncology drug platforms. The company's Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.82 was in-line with analyst’s estimates. The revenue of $3.8 billion climbed 17.6% year-over-year, outperforming market consensus by $30 million. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) is one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. On October 17, investment advisory Barclays initiated coverage of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) with an Overweight rating and a $64 price target. Analyst Matt Miksic issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) was part of 37 public stock portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 45 funds in the earlier quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 13 million shares valued at $836 million. Here is what Cooper Investors has to say about Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“During the quarter we exited our position in Baxter, having originally bought in 2017 as a Low Risk Turnaround with clear Stalwart attributes. In essence, the core businesses were highly durable, providing life sustaining or saving medical products such as IV medication or pumps and dialysis machines.They had been mismanaged prior to the company spinning off its biopharmaceutical business in 2015 which had generated most of Baxter's operating profit. With a new CEO in Joe Almeida, who came with a successful track record leading another medical device company (Covidien) we identified three sources of value latency for the new standalone Baxter.Firstly, optimizing the cost structure. Baxter was successful here – they were able to effectively double operating margins from low single digits to mid-to-high teens over a relatively short four-year period. Secondly, accelerating sales growth through a more focused R&amp;D effort. This is inherently more difficult than cost optimisation and on this front success has been muted with only moderate impact to revenues from new product introductions. Finally, capital deployment through Baxter’s significantly under-levered balance sheet. Several smaller bolt-on acquisitions were nicely complementary to the existing portfolio, but in early September the company announced the acquisition of Hil-Rom Holdings, a medical device company with leading positions in bed systems and patient monitoring. The deal is significant at US$12.5bn in size, and exhausts all balance sheet latency in one fell swoop.Whilst it is “EPS accretive” we believe the high single digit ROIC management are targeting over five years is most reflective of the financial merits of the deal. Put another way, despite visions of providing digital and connected healthcare (think a Baxter IV pump combined with a Hil-Rom smart bed), ultimately the combined entity will likely remain a low-to-mid-single digit grower. Baxter looks like it is getting bigger but not necessarily better.This combination of uncertainty around the merits of the Hil-Rom acquisition and the underwhelming performance on the product development side of the business led us to conclude that the investment proposition today is less attractive relative to other opportunities.”7. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Dividend Yield as of October 28: 5.25%Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the premier healthcare dividend stocks to buy now. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is an integrated healthcare, pharmacy, and retailer in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and internationally. On October 27, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. The dividend is payable on December 12, to shareholders of record on November 15. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)’s dividend yield on October 28 came in at 5.25%. On October 25, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill raised the price target on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) to $41 from $38 and reaffirmed a Hold rating on the shares. The analyst's core takeaway from the latest earnings call is that the speed of decline in pharmacy may have troughed and that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) may be in a position to make market share gains in the pharmacy space.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 40 hedge funds were long Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), compared to 38 funds in the preceding quarter. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.8 million shares worth $107 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”6. Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Dividend Yield as of October 28: 0.61%Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) is a California-based company that offers application focused solutions to the life sciences, diagnostics, and applied chemical markets worldwide. Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) paid a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share to shareholders on October 21. It is one of the best healthcare dividend stocks to invest in. Credit Suisse analyst Dan Leonard on August 24 initiated coverage of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) with an Outperform rating and a $165 price target. The analyst believes that the Street ""underappreciates its ability to grow toward the top end of the industry in multiple macro environments."" The analyst thinks a premium multiple to its peers is appropriate for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) given its swift growth prospects.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) at the end of June 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. Ian Simm’s Impax Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.17 million shares worth $495 million. In addition to Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) is one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to elite hedge funds. Here is what Pershing Square Holdings has to say about Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Our large commitment to UMG required that we raise cash from the sale of one of our other investments. In light of the high quality of companies in our portfolio, this was a difficult decision to make. Ultimately, we chose to sell Agilent, as its current share price approached our conservative estimate of intrinsic value. If we did not need the capital, we would not have sold the stock.Agilent has been a highly successful investment since our original purchase nearly two years ago, compounded by our additional investment in the company in the Covid market decline last year. Agilent’s stock price has increased 2.2 times since our initial purchase as a result of the company’s acceleration in revenue growth and profitability.10 Agilent has been a critical supplier of technology and services to labs around the world fighting the Covid pandemic. The company’s management team led by Mike McMullen deserves enormous credit for the company’s success and for its important contribution to science and the fight against Covid for which we all should be extremely grateful.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:Best Dividend Stocks Under $5Best Stocks For Beginners with Little Money11 Best Insurance Stocks That Pay Dividends Disclosure: None. 11 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are just a handful of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, which we’ll examine in this article.The NASDAQ index isn’t typically known for its high-dividend paying stocks. In fact, some of the most prominent companies that make up the index, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), fail to pay any dividend at all.The NASDAQ 100 index’s dividend yield stands at just a hair above 1%, which is rather paltry when compared to the companies that make up the Dow Jones index, which yields more than twice that at 2.27%. The average dividend yield of the companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index also stands at a far more robust 1.8%.Those figures aren’t totally surprising given the makeup of many of the companies on those indexes. While the Dow and S&amp;P are known for boasting many mature companies that have stable cash flows that make them safe dividend stock picks, the same can’t be said of the NASDAQ, which features many young tech companies that are still in their high-growth stages.Those dynamics are also apparent in the performance of those indexes this year. While the Dow shot up by 800 points on October 28 and has registered four straight weeks of gains, the NASDAQ has continued to flounder for the most part, down 30% year-to-date, though it has gained 7% in the last two weeks. With investors being bearish and looking to the defensive side of the market to get them through the current economic environment, high-growth tech companies that lose money are rarely on the menu.Some of the best dividend stocks on the market can be found in the NASDAQ however, with yields that top 2% and steady income streams to support not only their current dividend payouts, but continued dividend growth as well. Notably, many of them are not traditional NASDAQ tech stocks, though several prominent tech heavyweights also feature on the list.Story continuesWe’ll take a look at all of those top dividend stocks in this article, which feature yields above 2%. We’ll also look into their cash flow situation, dividend history, and more, to get a sense of how suitable an investment they are.15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Our MethodologyThe following NASDAQ dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy15. NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 Dividend Yield: 2.8% Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) are some of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, a label which also applies to Chinese video game giant NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES). The company, which develops and publishes PC MMORPGs and mobile games, including Diablo Immortal in China, has a variable dividend policy based on the previous quarter’s earnings. NetEase’s most recent quarterly dividend grew by 12% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the company’s five year dividend growth rate of 12.1%.NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has been facing some headwinds in China, most notably from the Chinese government, which didn’t approve any of its games for release for over a year as it seeks to crack down on videogame addiction in the country. NetEase was finally issued a license for a new game in September, but more importantly, Diablo Immortal was also released in Q3 after a slight delay, which should help offset any slowdown in its other titles.Hedge fund ownership of NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has slumped heavily over the last year, falling by 41% during that time to hit a four-year low. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates were some of the biggest money managers to sell off their NTES positions during Q2. William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management held the largest stake among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey on June 30, owning 3.67 million shares.14. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 Dividend Yield: 2.02% Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) raised its dividend by 6.7% in Q4, which also pushed it 33% higher than Q2 of 2021. That’s been a positive development for the company’s dividend investors, which had been saddled with a flat dividend for ten straight quarters prior to Q3 2021. KDP shares currently yield just over 2% and the dividend is well supported, with the company’s payout ratio being less than 50%.Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) deliver adjusted EPS of $0.46 in Q3 alongside revenue of $3.62 billion, results that were in line with expectations. The company also reaffirmed its FY22 revenue and EPS guidance, which called for low-double-digit growth in the former and mid-single-digit growth in the latter. With the company seemingly overcoming the supply chain challenges that hampered its coffee business earlier this year, it expects strong sales and earnings growth from the business in Q4.Hedge fund ownership of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) spiked during the third quarter of 2020 but immediately fell back to baseline during the following quarter, where it’s remained since. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors opened a 1.89 million shares position in KDP during Q2, while Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management raised its stake in the company by 150% during the quarter to 1.63 million shares.13. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 30 Dividend Yield: 3.71% American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) is growing its dividend by 6.4% in Q4, pushing its yield to 3.71%. The company has grown its dividend for 12 straight years and has a very manageable payout ratio of 62%. AEP is transitioning to cleaner energy systems that the company believes will support long-term earnings growth. Its Q3 operating EPS was $1.62, beating estimates by $0.06, while its $5.5 billion in revenue topped estimates by a hearty $750 million.Hedge fund ownership of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) has dipped for three straight quarters, dropping by 21% during that time. Joel Greenblatt’s Gotham Asset Management and Peter Muller’s PDT Partners were among the funds to sell out of their AEP positions during Q2. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies held the largest position on June 30 at 1.03 million shares.ClearBridge Investments owns 780,980 shares of AEP as of June 30 and likes American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)’s aggressive renewables ramp, adding the stock to its portfolio during Q1 and discussing it in the ClearBridge Investments Value Equity Q1 2022 investor letter:“About 5% of the portfolio is in transitioning power companies, typically migrating from coal to renewables. We have been active in encouraging these transitions and added a new position in American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP). AEP has the fastest planned renewable energy ramp in the U.S., with plans to both shrink coal and grow renewables by 50% each by 2030. This would drive an 80% emissions reduction, while supporting high single-digit earnings growth at a double-digit return.”12. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 32 Dividend Yield: 3.48% Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)’s dividend was cut by 11.1% this year and has largely stagnated for several years, with it currently paying out less than it was in 2018. With a solid yield and payout ratio under 50%, it’s still a dividend worth considering, especially given that it should benefit from the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act. BMO Capital analyst James Thalacker has an ‘Outperform” rating on EXC shares and believes the company is well positioned to achieve multiple expansion.There was a big sell off of Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) by hedge funds during the first quarter of this year, as there was a 31% drop in ownership of the stock. Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp and Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management were among the funds to unload their EXC positions during Q1. Ownership of the stock remained flat during Q2.ClearBridge Investments, which owns 1.62 million EXC shares as of June 30, believes Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is starting to be viewed as a premium utility, as revealed in the ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Value Strategy’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. electric utility Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) was also a top contributor. Exelon is a pure transmission and distribution regulated utility business serving millions of electric and gas customers across Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Shares outperformed along with the utilities sector; Exelon is also starting to be viewed as a premium name after its recently completed spin-off of power generation business Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG).”11. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 33 Dividend Yield: 2.55% Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) grew its dividend by 10.7% this year, marking its 24th straight year of dividend growth and positioning the company to join the select group of Dividend Aristocrats next year. The company has grown its dividend at a strong CAGR of 14.1% over the past five years, which has pushed the stock’s yield above 2.5%. The company’s payout ratio is just under 65%.Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) reported Q3 revenue and EPS of $1.8 billion and $0.50 respectively, which were largely in line with estimates, though topping them slightly. Net sales were up by 16% year-over-year during Q3, including 21.4% year-over-year growth in August. Argus analyst John Eade has a ‘Buy’ rating on FAST shares and believes the company can generate high-single-digit EPS growth over the long-term, which should support continued dividend growth.There was a 17% jump in hedge fund ownership of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) during Q2. Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management built a large stake in the company of 1.14 million shares during Q2, while Israel Englander’s Millennium Management hiked its position by 1,174% to 973,277 shares.10. Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 37 Dividend Yield: 2.64% Payroll and HR services provider Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has been steadily growing its earnings for the last decade and the company is starting to get more aggressive with its dividend as a result, raising it by 19.7% in the second quarter of this year. PAYX shares now yield a solid 2.64%, though the company’s payout ratio is slightly high at just under 75%.Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has grown its earnings at close to an 11% clip on an annualized basis over the past five years and the company expects more of the same in FY23, predicting 11% to 12% earnings growth, so it should have no problem continuing to grow its dividend as it’s done for the past seven years. The company’s Q1 FY23 EPS was $1.03, beating estimates by $0.06.There’s been a 37% jump in the number of smart money managers long Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) during the past five quarters, as hedge funds become increasingly intrigued by the company’s growing customer base. Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group owns 2.14 million PAYX shares as of June 30, the largest stake in the company among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey.9. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 2.82% Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) grew its dividend by 10.7% in the third quarter of this year, which represented slowing growth compared to its dividend’s 15.5% CAGR over the past five years. With a payout ratio of just over 20%, Skyworks should have no trouble maintaining double digit dividend growth in the years to come.The radiofrequency device manufacturer is expanding its offerings across multiple markets in the wake of the possibility that it will lose its biggest customer Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the years to come. Its revenue from non-mobile phone products grew by 38% year-over-year in Q2 to account for 38% of the company’s revenue, so it’s on the right track.Hedge fund ownership of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) was flat during the second quarter but is down by 24% since the third quarter of 2020 as hedge funds increasingly shy away from semiconductor stocks during the current cycle. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management also unloaded her SWKS stake during Q3.Heartland Advisors, which owns 119,628 shares of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) as of June 30, discussed how cheap the stock has become in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”8. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 5.25% Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is a Dividend Aristocrat, pushing towards 30 consecutive years of dividend growth. Its dividend inched up to $0.48 in Q3 and has grown at less than a 5% CAGR over the past five years, but with a yield that’s already above 5%, its shares should nonetheless be attractive to dividend investors. While Walgreens’ payout ratio is under 40%, its profit margins are also slim, which could cause issues if its expansion into the primary care field doesn’t pan out.Hedge fund ownership of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) trended down heavily between 2015 and 2019, falling by more than half during that time, and was remained relatively flat since. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management owns 2.83 million WBA shares as of June 30, having 4.64% 13F exposure to the stock.Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity, which sold out of its Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2, discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”7. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Dividend Yield: 4.11% The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) slashed its dividend by 36% in 2019 and it’s been flat ever since, so investors shouldn’t count on it growing any time soon, especially with the company’s margins being heavily pressured in Q2. Still, with a yield above 4% thanks to KHC shares cratering over the past five years, it may be an opportune time to for investors to add a good defensive dividend stock to their portfolios.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) surged its prices by 12.4% in Q2 but margins still fell by more than four percentage points year-over-year to just over 30% and sales volumes fell by over 2%. The company’s revenue and adjusted net income did beat estimates in Q3, coming in at $6.5 billion and $0.63 per share respectively, but year-over-year sales volumes fell again, this time by nearly 4%.Hedge fund ownership of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) ticked up by 19% during the second quarter as hedge funds began taking a harder look at quality food producers in an investing environment turning more defensive. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintains the largest stake in KHC as of June 30, owning nearly 326 million shares worth $12.4 billion.6. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 Dividend Yield: 2.18% Closing out the first part of the list is eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), which has already grown its dividend payments by 57% since first instituting them in the second quarter of 2019. The e-commerce platform made its most aggressive dividend hike yet in the first quarter of this year, raising its dividend by 22%. With a yield now topping 2% and a payout ratio of just 20%, eBay is becoming a compelling dividend stock for investors to consider.While the number of active buyers on eBay’s platform fell by 12% year-over-year in Q2, the company’s strong profit margins should ensure continued earnings power for years to come, especially with eBay’s take rate growing by 130 basis points to 12.4%. There’s plenty of room for further growth in that regard, as rival Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)’s take rate is nearly 20%.Hedge fund ownership of eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) dropped by 20% during the first half of 2022 and is less than half what it was eight years ago. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners both sold out of their EBAY stakes during the second quarter.Smead Capital Management, which owns 2.97 million eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) shares as of June 30, discussed the stock’s poor run in Smead Value Fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Paychex (PAYX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PAYX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Paychex's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Paychex's main business drivers.Paychex, Inc. is one of the leading providers of integrated human capital management (“HCM”) solutions for payroll, human resource (“HR”), retirement, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses. The company was incorporated in Delaware in 1979.The company’s payroll processing services include payroll processing, payroll tax administration services, employee payment servicesand regulatory compliance services.

The company maintains its corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and serves clients throughout the United States and Europe. The company has one business segment. Its fiscal year ends on May 31.Story continuesPaychex operates under two broad categories — Total Service Revenue, and Interest on Funds Held for Clients. In fiscal 2021, Total Service Revenue made up 98.5% of total revenues and comprised two sub-segments: Management solutions (75.6% of Total Service Revenue) and professional employer organization (PEO) and insurance services (24.4% of Total Service Revenue). Interest on Funds Held for Clients accounted for the remaining 1.5% of fiscal 2020 total revenues.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Paychex ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $3,637.72, or a 263.77% gain, as of October 31, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 176.29% and the price of gold increased -8.19% over the same time frame in comparison.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for PAYX.Paychex's shares have outperformed its industry in the past year, partly due to consecutive earnings and revenue beat in the past four quarters. The company looks strong on the back of solid top-line growth and dominant position in the outsourcing market.

79,4cc9b972-50cf-3708-9b36-7a06ae7ee8f1,SBUX,2022-11-01,Starbucks: Unionization petitions experience slowdown amid nationwide negotiations,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/starbucks-unionization-petitions-experience-slowdown-195925944.html,1667246365,VIDEO,['SBUX'],"[Yahoo Finance Live assesses the slowing rate of Starbucks store employees filing for unionization in late 2022 while store representatives continue bargaining with employees across the country.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, well, shifting gears now to Starbucks. Their cafes hoping to join the Starbucks Workers United labor union slowed considerably this fall. Now, just 12 stores actually filed petitions for representation last month. That's down from a high of 71 in March, according to the National Labor Relations Board. Now, since the first stores voted in Buffalo, New York late last year, the board has certified unions in 243 of the company's 9,000 stores across the country. Last week, Starbucks entered into bargaining processes with 41 unionized cafes and has proposed dates for another 43.Now, the coffee giant has responded in the months since, offering new benefits to non-union stores, including wage increases and operational and equipment improvements, some of the things that they had been calling for. It does make sense that if they're investing these hundreds of millions of dollars to make conditions better and make pay better as well. It's no surprise, then, that we're seeing this sort of slowdown if some of the workers are actually getting some of the benefits that they've been asking for, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, you mentioned that September number. The number in the month of August was the smallest to date under this unionization push, just 8. And they have suffered 50 losses that have gone largely unreported. Strange connection I'm going to make here, but bear with me, Rachelle. Remember what happened with LIV Golf? They came on the scene. They really rattled the entire sports world. What happened?Well, the PGA adjusted. They said, OK, we're going to have to up our pay. We're going to have to up our game. We're going to have to add new tournaments. We're going to really change the economic model for the players. And it largely worked, and it largely quieted all the effort. All the gains from LIV, really, I think, squashed.Story continuesSo I think you see a similar effect here with Starbucks. The unionization effort push was, ultimately, in the end, helpful for these thousands of employees across the country because Starbucks had to respond. They had to do something to improve the conditions, and to your point, the working, the pay, the wages. So they raised the boat, you know. So I think in the end, this was a win, even if unionization continues to die down across the country.The other factor here to consider is, of course, when we feel like we might be entering a recession. With inflation so high, I think you're getting some people eager to hang on to a job, and at least, bear down for the moment.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And it does also show that shift from Starbucks because at first, we saw a lot of-- perhaps a lot of these employees wondering if their store was going to close if they complained. So they tried the stick method. So it's interesting that now they're going with the carrot method. That seems to be much more effective than, obviously, some of the threats of potentially people losing their jobs or having their stores closed to fix some of these issues.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, you do hear some say there was a bit of a chilling effect by some of those moves, closing some of those stores that were unsafe, also unionized, but looks to be a quieting movement.]"

However, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 11.1%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for Parker-Hannifin’s fiscal first quarter.ParkerHannifin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseParkerHannifin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseParkerHannifin Corporation price-eps-surprise | ParkerHannifin Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteWith continued expansion in manufacturing activities, solid demand across end markets is likely to have aided PH’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The Diversified Industrial segment’s performance is likely to have been driven by strong revenues in the North America sub-segment owing to higher orders. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diversified Industrial North America segment revenues in the fiscal first quarter indicates a 10.8% increase from the year-ago reported quarter.Effective pricing and supply-chain management actions are expected to have supported margin performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The acquisition of Meggitt in September is likely to have contributed to PH’s top line in the fiscal first quarter.However, escalating cost of sales (due to high raw material costs) and selling, general and administrative expenses might have dented Parker-Hannifin’s bottom line. Given the company’s substantial international presence, foreign-currency headwinds are expected to have hurt the top line.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Parker-Hannifin this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.

83,86b9f569-a80c-3c1d-b23d-02f7e49d4976,PH,2022-11-01,Earnings Preview: Helios Technologies (HLIO) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-helios-technologies-hlio-140102845.html,1667224862,STORY,"['HLIO', 'PH']","[The market expects Helios Technologies (HLIO) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 7, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.4%.Revenues are expected to be $221 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.68% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Helios Technologies?For Helios Technologies, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.06%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Helios Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Helios Technologies would post earnings of $1.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.18, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Helios Technologies doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, Parker-Hannifin (PH), is soon expected to post earnings of $4.15 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -2.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.92 billion, up 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Parker-Hannifin has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.02%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Parker-Hannifin will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Unaudited)Impact of Certain ItemsOur discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than free cash flow and EBITDA, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of: (1) restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (a) restructuring charges, (b) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and (c) facility closure and severance charges; (2) acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions; and (3) the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collectability of our pre-pandemic trade receivable balances. Our results for fiscal 2023 were also impacted by adjustments to a product return allowance related to COVID-related personal protection equipment inventory. Our results for fiscal 2022 were also impacted by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions.The results of our foreign operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our total Sysco and our International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency operating results are calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items and presenting its International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis.Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions and excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, acquisition costs and due-diligence costs for those acquisitions. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco’s results for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.Set forth below is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented. Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add up to the total presented due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.Sysco Corporation and its Consolidated SubsidiariesNon-GAAP Reconciliation

and its Consolidated SubsidiariesNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)Free Cash Flow(In Thousands)Free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment and includes proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. Sysco considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. However, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP.

The net earnings (loss) component of our EBITDA calculation is impacted by Certain Items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance. As a result, in the non-GAAP reconciliations below for each period presented, adjusted EBITDA is computed as EBITDA plus the impact of Certain Items, excluding certain items related to interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Sysco's management considers growth in this metric to be a measure of overall financial performance that provides useful information to management and investors about the profitability of the business, as it facilitates comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business. Additionally, it is a commonly used component metric used to inform on capital structure decisions.

Due to these uncertainties, we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of projected adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable effort. However, we expect to calculate adjusted earnings per share for future periods in the same manner as the reconciliations provided for the historical periods herein.For more information contact:  Kevin KimInvestor Contactkevin.kim@sysco.comT 281-584-1219Shannon MutschlerMedia Contactshannon.mutschler@sysco.comT 281-584-4059]"

With this earlier retirement, along with accelerated coal plant retirements in other states, the company will exit the use of coal by the end of 2030 when the Comanche 3 coal unit in Colorado retires.The company is leading the nation’s clean energy transition as it reduces carbon emissions 80% by 2030 for electric customers, with a vision to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. Retiring coal generation while continuing to add reliable and affordable clean energy sources are key to Xcel Energy’s strategy in the eight states it serves.""As the first energy provider in the nation to set ambitious goals for addressing all the ways our customers use energy – electricity, heating and transportation – we are always striving to provide our customers cleaner energy resources, while saving them money,"" said Bob Frenzel, chairman, president and CEO of Xcel Energy. ""Advancing the retirement of coal operations at Tolk Station demonstrates our commitment to our clean energy strategy, while ensuring our customers and communities have reliable, affordable and safe service.""In addition to accelerating the clean energy transition, retiring coal at Tolk Station earlier than planned is estimated to save Xcel Energy’s customers in Texas and New Mexico more than $70 million. With the proposed earlier retirement date, Tolk will continue flexible operations to optimize generation when natural gas prices are high while managing limited remaining water resources. Additionally, changes in federal laws are making the replacement of coal generation with cleaner energy sources more cost-effective.In November, Xcel Energy will propose to New Mexico regulators to move Tolk’s retirement date, previously set in the 2032-34 timeframe, to 2028. The proposal will go before Texas regulators in February 2023. Xcel Energy plans to continue operations of currently installed synchronous condensers at Tolk after 2028 as they continue to help ensure the stability of the regional grid.Story continuesThroughout its clean energy transition, Xcel Energy has focused on affordability and reliability for its customers, while working with employees and communities that host its power plants to ensure a smooth transition. Through future regulatory processes, the company expects a diverse mix of replacement generation, including wind and solar, to be developed near Tolk after coal operations are retired.""For more than forty years, the dedicated employees at Tolk Generating Station have provided reliable and safe service to our Texas and New Mexico customers and communities,"" said Adrian Rodriguez, president, Xcel Energy New Mexico, Texas. ""While we maximize replacement generation in the region, we’re also committed to transition our employees into new roles as needed, something we’ve done successfully at other Xcel Energy plants.""Tolk Station, located roughly 70 miles northwest of Lubbock, includes two coal-fueled steam units with a combined capacity of 1,067 megawatts.About Xcel EnergyXcel Energy (NASDAQ: XEL) provides the energy that powers millions of homes and businesses across eight Western and Midwestern states.

Also, business transient and group demand in the urban markets have been improving on the back of return-to-office policies implemented by companies.Host Hotels’ well-located properties in markets with strong demand drivers like central business districts of main cities, close to airports and in resort/conference destinations are likely to have benefited from this positive trend in the third quarter.Also, the continued strength in the Sunbelt markets, where the company has a strong presence, is anticipated to have driven the demand for its properties.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RevPAR stands at $191.6, indicating a jump of 92.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $99.7. The same for average occupancy rate is pegged at 72%, suggesting a considerable improvement from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of 42.1%.HST’s capital-recycling efforts are anticipated to have aided the company’s acquisition and development activities during the quarter. Further, these efforts are likely to have relieved the pressure on its balance sheet.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HST’s third-quarter revenues is presently pegged at $1.17 billion, implying growth of 38.5% from the prior-year period’s reported figure of $844 million.However, seasonality and changing market and business mix might have limited the company’s growth tempo to a certain extent during the quarter.Host Hotels’ activities during the third quarter were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the FFO per share has been revised 2.5% downward over the past week to 39 cents. Nonetheless, on a year-over-year basis, it indicates a whopping jump of 95%.Story continuesEarning WhispersHost Hotels has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of a beat.Earnings ESP: Host Hotels has an Earnings ESP of +0.71%.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Boring Stocks That Make Money.Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) are a few of the most boring stocks in the world that should nonetheless entice investors thanks to their penchant for making money.Finding boring and dull stocks to invest in may not be the most exciting proposition in the world, but it’s integral to building a balanced portfolio that will perform well during even the most challenging market conditions. Such a scenario is upon us now, with investors increasingly turning to stable, boring stocks to fill out their portfolios as opposed to ones with greater long-term growth potential.What constitutes a boring stock is likely different for every investor, but some of the most common criteria include stocks that have a low beta, or volatility, which means they tend to avoid wild valuation swings. While that may be boring for day traders looking to profit from such swings with well-timed trades, investors looking to build a portfolio with an eye on steady long-term growth could do a lot worse than filling it with boring stocks.Low growth rates are another element of boring stocks that can make them unappealing to the masses. Barring some incredible fortune, there’s simply no means by which most boring stocks will ever compound at a significant rate over the long-term. Many of these companies have stable cash generating businesses, but their prospects for growth are minimal.Nonetheless, low volatility stocks frequently outperform their higher volatility brethren over the long-term, as they did between 1990 and 2011. Interestingly, the research that uncovered those results pointed to money managers as being one of the culprits. In their drive to beat market benchmarks, money managers frequently load up on riskier stocks that they hope will outperform, driving up their valuations. Likewise, the avoidance of low-growth, boring companies by those same money managers somewhat suppresses their own valuations.Story continuesIn the following list, we’ll take a look at ten boring stocks, all of which have generated at least $100 million in trailing twelve month net income, and many of which have generated billions. We’ll analyze why these stocks are boring, but why that also makes them intriguing long-term investments.10 Boring Stocks That Make Money 360b/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe following boring, money-making stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Boring Stocks That Make Money10. American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $1.3 billion Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) are some of the most boring stocks on the market that also happen to make a lot of money. Another is American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK), which pulled in $1.3 billion in net income over the trailing 12-month period.With a beta of 0.5 and relatively slow revenue and income growth, American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) is a pretty boring stock compared to some of the high-flying stocks out there. The utilities company did surge its EPS by more than $3.00 in 2021 however, hitting $6.96. Also of note is the company’s acquisition spree, with 30 agreements in place as of the end of Q2, which comes hot on the heels of 23 acquisitions being completed last year.Hedge funds have largely been maintaining their stakes in American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) for the past five years, with little overall movement in ownership of the stock. Ian SImm’s Impax Asset Management owns by far the largest stake in the company among the fund’s tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 4.91 million shares of AWK as of June 30.9. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 33 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $2.07 billion If a company that leases public storage units sounds likely to be a boring stock, well it is. But Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a boring stock that’s earned an impressive $2.07 billion in net income over the trailing 12 month period. With a 0.38 beta, it’s a stock that’s not likely to do a whole lot one way or the other barring major news, but the company did have a strong 2021 after multiple years of slower growth. Revenue grew by more than 17% to $3.42 billion, while EPS grew by more than 50% to $9.91.Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) has become a lot more popular among hedge funds over the past year, with the stock hovering around all-time highs in terms of smart money ownership. The company boasts several major industry players as bulls, including Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management and Jeffrey Furber’s AEW Capital Management.The Baron Real Estate Income Fund is bullish on Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)’s leading position in many of its top markets, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Following strong performance in the first quarter of 2022, the shares of Public Storage Incorporated, a REIT that is the world’s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, declined 21% in the second quarter (a similar decline to most other REITs). We remain optimistic about the company’s long-term prospects. Public Storage’s nearly 2,500 self-storage facilities across the U.S. serve more than one million customers. The company has achieved the #1 market position in 14 of its top 15 markets.We are encouraged about the company’s prospects due to our expectations for the continuation of strong occupancy and rent trends, limited new supply, mid-teens organic cash flow growth, the potential for mergers and acquisitions activity in part due to the company’s well-capitalized and low leverage balance sheet, and the ability to increase rents monthly to combat inflation headwinds. We believe Public Storage’s shares are currently valued at a discount to private market self-storage values and offer prospects for mid-teens total returns in the next few years.”8. Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 37 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $113 million Food distributors like Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) aren’t going to set the world on fire, but the company’s on a nice little run right now, with $113 million in trailing 12 month net income and exceptional revenue growth of 67% during its latest fiscal year ended June 30, hitting $50.9 billion thanks to a strong year-over-year rebound for restaurants. That trend appears to have continued in Q3, though the company’s FY23 revenue growth is expected to be no greater than 13.9% against the tougher comps.Hedge fund ownership of Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) jumped by 28% during the second quarter as several hedge funds took notice of the company. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group owns 3.58 million PFGC shares as of June 30, adding a net total of 90,946 shares to its portfolio during Q2.The ClearBridge Investments Select Strategy, which owns 5.42 million Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) shares as of June 30, discussed the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“Performance Food Group is another example of a quality franchise bought during a depressing period for the foodservice industry that has flexed its balance sheet to make acquisitions of weaker players and continues to consolidate its leading market share.”7. Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 39 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $264 million Lithium company Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) has some strong secular tailwinds at its back that make for a somewhat exciting stock, though its past few years of results have been dull at best. The company’s revenue fell slightly between 2018 and 2021, while its EPS crated from more than $6 to just above $1. Those metrics are improving substantially this year however, with the company trending towards record figures across the board.Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) hit an all-time high in hedge fund ownership at the end of 2021, but there was a 20% drop in ownership during the first half of this year. Jay Chen’s Himension Capital owned 383,348 ALB shares on June 30, giving its 8.95% 13F exposure to the stock.Carillon Tower Advisers is bullish on Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)’s opportunity in the electric vehicle space, as the fund discussed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a global specialty chemicals company with leading positions in lithium, bromine, and refining catalysts. The company’s shares outperformed meaningfully in the quarter, driven largely by robust demand for lithium used to manufacture electric vehicle batteries. Albemarle is well-positioned for the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and could benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act.”6. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 45 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $6.76 billion Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) has been about as stable and boring as a stock can get, with trailing 12 month revenue that’s essentially flat from 2018 levels and operating income that’s declined during that time. But the company makes boatloads of money, with more than $6 billion in net income in 2018, 2019, and 2021. It’s also in the midst of a banner year, with Q3 revenue jumping by 21% year-over-year and EPS surging by 46% and crushing estimates. Heck, with growth rates like that, Caterpillar might just be capable of creeping off the most boring stocks list some day.There was a 16% dip in hedge fund ownership of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) during Q2, as hedge funds timed their exits from the stock near its peak. CAT shares would subsequently fall by 29% between June 8 and September 27, but have railed over the last month. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital owns over 1.9 million shares of Caterpillar as of June 30.The Diamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund added Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) to its portfolio during Q1, laying out some of the reasons why in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) are more yawn-inducing stocks that make lots of money.

You should consider the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/17/2015.The fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $11.16 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.09%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.54%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 26.20% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.35% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 23.3% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskGSLC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of large-capitalization U.S. issuers.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -18.42% so far this year and is down about -14.92% in the last one year (as of 11/01/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $71.02 and $95.62.The ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 24.39% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 439 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GSLC is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $294.41 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $363.98 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Dow was on track for its biggest monthly percentage gain since January 1976. Comments from Fed officials after the policy decision as well as labor market data later this week will help shape market expectations for future hikes.""Today is just a reaction to what happened last week, we had a profound move in the market last week on the upside...so it makes sense that we certainly have to back and fill today,"" said Eric Diton, president and managing director at The Wealth Alliance in Boca Raton, Florida.""We will wait and see and maybe the Fed meeting will give us some direction.

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.40%.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Global Payments: mixed.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Schlumberger Ltd. SLB, Halliburton Co. HAL, VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF OIH, iShares US Oil Equipment &amp; Services ETF IEZ, and Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Upbeat Earnings Boost Oil Service ETFsBig oil services companies started releasing their quarterly numbers from this week. The outlook is bullish this time thanks to the upbeat oil market. OPEC+ producers agreed on deep output cuts, seeking to spur a recovery in crude prices despite repeated calls from U.S. President Joe Biden's administration for the group to pump more to lower fuel prices and contain global inflation.Against this backdrop, a close monitoring of the energy space, which deals with oil field services, is warranted. Let's delve a little deeper into the earnings picture and see how things are shaping up for the space.Schlumberger in Focus On Oct 20, Schlumberger Ltd. has reported third-quarter 2022 earnings of 63 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. The bottom line significantly increased from the year-ago quarter's earnings of 36 cents.The oilfield service giant recorded total quarterly revenues of $7,477 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,143 million. The top line also improved from the year-ago quarter's $5,847 million.Halliburton in FocusOn Oct 25, Halliburton Co. reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted net income per share of 60 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents and improving from the year-ago profit of 28 cents. The outperformance reflects stronger-than-expected profit from both its divisions and came in spite of the company's exit from Russia.Story continuesRevenues of $5.4 billion were 38.8% higher than the corresponding period of 2021 and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion. North American revenues rose 63.2% year over year to $2.6 billion, while revenues from Halliburton's international operations were up 21.2% from the year-ago period to $2.7 billion. Investors should know that HAL has outsized exposure to the North American land drilling market.Market ImpactInvestors might want to know the impact of earnings results on ETFs that are heavily invested in these popular oil service companies. Below we highlight three oil-services ETFs with considerable allocation to SLB and HAL that could be in focus:VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF OIH invests $2.79 billion of assets in 25 holdings and devotes as much as 22.45% of the portfolio weight to SLB, followed by 11.48% in HAL. Generally, when one stock accounts for as much as 20% of an ETF's weight, its individual performance decides much of the fund's price movement. OIH gained 13.8% in the past five days (as of Oct 26, 2022).iShares US Oil Equipment &amp; Services ETFThis ETF invests about $200.0 million of assets in about 26 securities, focusing solely on the energy world. The in-focus SLB takes up the first position here with 24.94% of holdings. HAL takes up the second position with about 21.28% of total assets. The fund added 14.7% in the past five days.Energy Select Sector SPDR FundXLE invests about $41.62 billion of assets in 23 stocks. The fund puts 5.11% of the portfolio weight in SLB. It added about 7.2% in the past five days.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

As anticipated, we continue to experience demand and margin recovery in our Specialized Products segment. The U.S. bedding market remains fairly stable but at relatively weak levels, and we began to see slowing in other markets such as European bedding, home furniture, work furniture, and steel.

This compares to FFO of $0.71 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 9.46%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.79 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.83, delivering a surprise of 5.06%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Vornado , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $457.43 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.70%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $409.21 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Vornado shares have lost about 43.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.2%.What's Next for Vornado?While Vornado has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Vornado: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.70 on $438.72 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.07 on $1.76 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the bottom 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Ventas (VTR), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This seniors housing real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Ventas' revenues are expected to be $1.03 billion, up 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

VTR is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Nov 3, after market close. Its quarterly results will likely highlight year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the previous quarter, this Chicago, IL-based healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered normalized FFO per share of 72 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarterly results reflected growth in occupancy and improvement in pricing power for the senior housing operating portfolio (SHOP). Additionally, the office portfolio witnessed growth in same-store net operating income (NOI), while there was weakness in the triple-net leased portfolio.Ventas’ normalized FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and met the same in the other two, the average beat being 1.36%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVentas, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVentas, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ventas, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayVentas’ SHOP portfolio, which refers to its senior housing communities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, has been witnessing improvement in the occupancy levels as net-move ins are on the rise.Per the company’s latest investor presentation, the SHOP portfolio’s preliminary average occupancy from the beginning of the third quarter through Sep 12, 2022, totaled 84.5%. This implied a rise of 80 basis points (bps) from the second quarter and a 240 bps growth from the prior-year period.The increase was mainly led by the U.S. portfolio, which rose 100 bps from the previous quarter and 280 bps from the year-ago quarter. Canada’s growth was muted compared to the United States due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and grew only 170 bps year over year.The net move-in and move-out improved in August from July, primarily due to more move-ins and lower move-outs compared with the prior month.In addition, senior citizens constitute a major customer base of healthcare services and incur higher healthcare expenditures compared with the average population. Ventas’ SHOP portfolio is likely to have continued to capitalize on this positive trend during the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter resident fees and services is pegged at $664 million, suggesting an increase from $658 million reported in the prior quarter and $558 million in the year-ago period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $1.03 billion, implying a 5.8% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In addition, in its second-quarter earnings release, VTR had estimated the SHOP segment same-store cash NOI to lie between 9% and 15% based on revenue growth driven by an expected rise in occupancy of 250 bps to 300 bps and improved rates for the third quarter.  Ventas’ life-science research &amp; innovation portfolio is anticipated to have witnessed solid demand during the quarter to be reported on the back of the growing need for drug research and innovation. As a result, this portfolio is likely to have experienced healthy leasing activity during the quarter.Also, the company’s strong balance sheet is expected to have aided its acquisition and development initiatives. Further, it received an outlook upgrade from Fitch Ratings during the quarter.However, per its latest presentation, VTR anticipated operating expenses for the third quarter to remain elevated.Further, per its second-quarter earnings release, the company expects normalized FFO is to be reduced by around 2 cents per share sequentially due to higher interest rates on floating rate debt and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.The consensus mark for the third-quarter rental income from its office buildings stands at $198 million, indicating a decline from the prior-year quarter’s reading of $202 million. Rental income from its triple-net leased portfolio is pegged at $150 million, suggesting a fall from the $181 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Ventas projected third-quarter 2022 normalized FFO per share in the range of 73-78 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same has been unchanged at 76 cents in the past month. It implies an increase of 4.1% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Ventas this season.

AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, Assurant Inc. AIZ, Unum Group UNM and RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. RNR, which are due to report tomorrow. However, an active catastrophe level is likely to have weighed on the upside.Better pricing, solid retention and exposure growth across business lines are likely to have aided premiums. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided in better pricing in the third quarter.Better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results. The third quarter of 2022 bore the brunt of Hurricane Ian. Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian to be in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion.Increased travel across the world is likely to have induced higher auto premiums. A stronger mortgage market is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums. A low unemployment rate is likely to have aided commercial insurance and group insurance. Lower mortality claims are likely to have aided margin expansion.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are expected to come up with improved investment results. The third quarter itself saw two rate hikes. A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate among others are expected to have aided net investment income.Accelerated digitalization is expected to have saved costs, thus aiding margins. A solid capital position aided insurers to get involved in strategic mergers and acquisitions to sharpen their competitive edge, build on a niche, expand geographically and diversify their portfolio apart from engaging in share buybacks and raising dividends in the third quarter.Let’s take a sneak peek into how the abovementioned insurers are poised prior to their third-quarter 2022 earnings on Nov 1.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.American International Group’s improved retention, new business and continued growth in the insurance premium rate are likely to have increased net premiums earned in General Insurance for the third quarter. Total premiums from Life and Retirement are expected to have increased due to improved pension risk transfer activities. However, profits from General Insurance are likely to have decreased due to increased losses and loss adjustment expenses, as well as a lower net investment income.

QuoteAssurant’s third-quarter revenues are likely to have benefited from improved net earned premiums, higher fees and other income and net investment income. Net earned premiums are expected to have benefited from continued organic growth from strong U.S. sales in the Global Automotive business. The Global Lifestyle segment is expected to have benefited from solid business automobile and auto.  Total benefits, losses and expenses might have escalated due to higher selling, underwriting, general and administrative expenses. The third quarter has been affected by higher catastrophes.

""Fiscal 2022 was outstanding for Hologic. We dramatically strengthened our base businesses, responded with agility to the world’s COVID testing needs, and most importantly, helped more and more women around the world.

COVID-19 for the year.""Recent HighlightsRevenue of $953.3 million decreased (27.6%) for the quarter, or (25.6%) in constant currency, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 assays and supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chips in our Breast Health business compared to the prior year period. Revenue, however, was significantly higher than the Company’s guidance of $840 to $870 million provided last quarter.Diagnostics revenue decreased (37.8%), or (35.6%) in constant currency, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 assays compared to the prior year period.Excluding COVID-19 revenues, Diagnostics revenue grew 11.1% on an organic, constant currency basis.Molecular Diagnostics revenue declined (43.2%), or (41.3%) in constant currency, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 assays compared to the prior year period.Excluding COVID-19 revenues, Molecular Diagnostics revenue grew 17.2% on an organic, constant currency basis.Breast Health revenue, as expected, declined (17.7%), or (16.0%) in constant currency, primarily due to lower gantry revenue resulting from semiconductor chip shortages.

""In our fiscal 2023, we expect continued strength in our base Diagnostics and Surgical businesses as well as a strong rebound in our Breast Health business over the course of the year.""Hologic’s financial guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023 is shown in the table below. The guidance is based on a full year non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19.0%, and diluted shares outstanding of 252 million for the full year. Constant currency guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates are the same in fiscal 2023 as in fiscal 2022. Organic revenue guidance is in constant currency and excludes the divested Blood Screening business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue guidance starting a year after the acquisition. Therefore, in fiscal 2023, Bolder is excluded from organic revenue in the fiscal first quarter, while Biotheranostics, Diagenode, Mobidiag, and Acessa are part of organic revenue for all of fiscal 2023.Current GuidanceGuidance $Reported %Increase(Decrease)Constant Currency% Increase(Decrease)Organic % Increase(Decrease)Fiscal 2023Revenue$3,700 - $3,900(23.9%) to (19.8%)(22.1%) to (18.0%)(22.0%) to (17.9%)GAAP EPS$2.51 - $2.81(51.1%) to (45.2%)Non-GAAP EPS$3.30 - $3.60(45.2%) to (40.2%)Q1 2023Revenue$940 - $990(36.1%) to (32.7%)(33.9%) to (30.5%)(34.2%) to (30.8%)GAAP EPS$0.60 - $0.70(69.2%) to (64.1%)Non-GAAP EPS$0.80 - $0.90(63.1%) to (58.5%)This guidance assumes low double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth ex. COVID-19 in each division for full-year fiscal 2023.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: constant currency revenues; organic revenues; organic revenues excluding COVID-19, non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating margin; non-GAAP effective tax rate; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP net margin; non-GAAP EPS; and adjusted EBITDA. Organic revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 excludes the divested Blood Screening business, as well as the acquired Bolder business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue starting a year after the acquisition. Organic revenue excluding COVID-19 revenues is organic revenue less COVID assay revenue, COVID related sales of instruments, COVID related revenue from Diagenode and Mobidiag, collection kits and ancillaries, as well as license revenue, and revenues from discontinued products. The Company defines its non-GAAP net income, EPS, and other non-GAAP financial measures to exclude, as applicable: (i) the amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and equipment; (ii) adjustments to record contingent consideration at fair value; (iii) additional expenses resulting from the purchase accounting adjustment to record inventory at fair value; (iv) restructuring and divestiture charges and facility closure and consolidation charges, including accelerated depreciation, and costs incurred to integrate acquisitions (including retention, transaction bonuses, legal and professional consulting services) and separate divested businesses from existing operations; (v) expenses related to the divested Cynosure business incurred subsequent to the disposition date primarily related to indemnification provisions for legal and tax matters; (vi) transaction related expenses for divestitures and acquisitions; (vii) third-party expenses incurred related to implementing the European MDR/IVDR requirements and obtaining the appropriate approvals for its existing products; (viii) debt extinguishment losses and related transaction costs; (ix) the unrealized (gains) losses on the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting; (x) litigation settlement charges (benefits) and non-income tax related charges (benefits); (xi) other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments and realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of investments; (xii) the one-time discrete impacts related to internal restructurings and non-operational items; (xiii) other one-time, non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's core business results; and (xiv) income taxes related to such adjustments. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as its non-GAAP net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense included in its non-GAAP net income.These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business.Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.Conference Call and WebcastHologic’s management will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

If you want to jump ahead to the top five companies in this list, then take a look at 5 Biggest Gas Companies in the World.The Gas Industry: An AnalysisThe ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the global push toward clean energy have placed an even higher premium on natural gas. The fuel has multiple advantages over both renewable energy and crude oil. Natural gas is a clean burning fuel, which results in fewer emissions and it is also able to generate higher amounts of energy per kilogram.Globally, gas is being sold at a premium and prices touched record high earlier this year when they crossed $10 per MMBtu. The prices have almost halved since then, and the natural gas futures market, which bets on the prices of the commodity for the next month, are also significantly down year to date. Yet, the futures continue to trade at the higher end of their 52-week range, as the shock in prices that erupted this year continues to make its mark felt.As for the gas industry itself, it is still one of the largest in the world and according to the research firm The Business Research Company, the market was worth $840 billion last year. From then to the end of this year, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% to sit at $940 billion. Additionally, the firm goes on to add that from the end of 2022 to 2026, the market will grow at a 6.9% CAGR and be worth $1.23 trillion by the end of the forecast period.For our list for you today, we will take a look at the largest natural gas companies in the world, and among the publicly traded names, the ones likely to catch your eye are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Photo by Robin Sommer on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn order to sift out the largest natural gas companies in the world, we studied the revenue of the companies and then ranked them according to their net sales.

Here is what the fund said:“We added one new position this quarter, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are met by TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in our list of the world's largest gas companies. Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Gas Companies in the World.  Suggested Articles:Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks To BuyWhat Are the Best Stocks To Buy Now?10 Most Undervalued Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 15 Biggest Gas Companies in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Negative volume and net price trends are likely to have hurt Enbrel’s sales in the quarter.Also, pricing pressure and increased competition are likely to have continued to hurt sales of some drugs as well as biosimilar products.The respective Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prolia, Xgeva, Blincyto, Repatha, Kyprolis and Evenity sales is pegged at $914 million, $552 million, $144 million, $331 million, $311 million and $199 million, respectively.Our estimates for Prolia, Xgeva, Blincyto, Repatha, Kyprolis and Evenity sales are pegged at $917.7 million, $545 million, $147.2 million, $321.2 million, $309.4 million and $203.7 million, respectively.For Otezla, broader adoption in the newly approved indication of mild-to-moderate psoriasis is likely to have pushed sales higher. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Otezla is $636 million, while our estimate is $616.4 million.Third-quarter sales of Amgen’s new KRAS inhibitor, Lumakras, are likely to have been higher than $77 million recorded in the second quarter. Lumakras, a first-in-class lung cancer treatment, is off to an excellent start while its label expansion studies, which have the potential to significantly expand the currently addressable patient population, are progressing rapidly. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lumakras/Lumykras is $92 million, while our estimate is $95.1 million.Story continuesAnother new drug, Tezspire (tezepelumab) is likely to have been a key contributor to the top line in the third quarter. Amgen has a partnership with AstraZeneca AZN for Tezspire. In September, AstraZeneca announced that Tezspire was approved in Japan and Europe. Amgen and AstraZeneca share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit inventor royalty to Amgen. While AstraZeneca leads development, Amgen leads manufacturing.For biosimilars, volume decline and price erosion due to increased competition are expected to have hurt the top line.Key Development in the QuarterIn August, Amgen announced a definitive agreement to acquire ChemoCentryx for $52 per share in cash, which amounts to a total enterprise value of approximately $3.7 billion. The acquisition will add the latter’s newly approved drug, Tavneos (avacopan), to Amgen’s inflammation and nephrology portfolio. Tavneos was approved for treating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis, a serious systemic autoimmune disease, in October last year. The acquisition closed on Oct 22Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Amgen this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Amgen’s Earnings ESP is -0.30% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $4.43 per share while the Most Accurate Estimate is $4.41 per share.

An encouraging earnings report from Apple Inc. AAPL managed to stem the rot in big-tech giants, and the sector recovered for the week.Moreover, GDP grew modestly in the third quarter, spurring hopes that the market has already bottomed out.

138,ad5a78b5-7960-32d0-87ba-cd3a093fe453,NEM,2022-11-01,10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US Dollar,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-buy-weak-121525930.html,1667304925,STORY,"['CAT', 'MCD', 'IBM', 'BA', 'NEM', 'KO', 'GOOGL']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best stocks to buy for a weak U.S. dollar. If you want to skip our background of why the dollar has been on the rampage this year, and take a look at the top stocks in today's list, head on over to 5 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US Dollar. The hottest topic right now in finance is the U.S. dollar. The dollar is the world's reserve currency, and it is used by most of the emerging economies central banks as their currency. A key reason why the 'greenback' reigns supreme is the oil and economic crisis of the 1970s that saw the U.S. dollar as the only currency available for oil payments and a safe haven asset. As the Bretton Woods financial system that had pegged global currencies to gold ended, the U.S., under President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia that would allow a continuing demand for the dollar in global markets and ensure that the value remained stable. This agreement led to the Saudis agreeing to sell and price oil only in the dollar, and in response, the U.S. agreed to provide military security to Saudi oilfields.From then to the present day, the dollar has reigned supreme and its fortunes are also dependent on oil as a stronger dollar results in lower oil prices due to lower demand from countries that use foreign exchange to buy the fuel. Additionally, a stronger dollar also helps importers that price their goods with the currency, since they can buy more goods. Conversely, exporters benefit when the dollar is weak since it allows them to sell more products overseas for the same dollar amount. As an example, an exporter that sells a good priced at $1 will see more sales if the local currency is stronger as it will bring in more revenue in the local currency for the same dollar unit.The strong dollar has hit American companies hard this year, at a time when they are also seeing sales evaporate at home due to inflation. According to Goldman Sachs, one third, or 29% of firms listed on the Standard and Poor's 500 index, get their sales from overseas. Some, such as the chip giant QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), end up bringing in as much as 96% of their sales from abroad.Story continuesHowever, the dollar might not reign supreme for long. The latest data in the U.S. point out that private sector wage growth dropped to 1.2% in the third quarter from 1.6% in the second quarter. Combined with inflation figures also being lower than economist estimates, there are whispers that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates. Should this happen, and the U.S. economy slows down, the dollar will lose value and as a result help a host of different firms.In this piece, we will take a look at some of the companies that can benefit from a decline in the greenback value and the top picks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US DollarPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a broad look at which firms earn the bulk of their revenue from exports and then narrowed the list down based on their product strength, financial performance, and market factors. Because a major chunk of revenue of these firms comes from outside of the US, a weak dollar is net positive for them.10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US Dollar10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American technology company that offers hardware infrastructure and cloud computing services to other firms. It is headquartered in Armonk, New York.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s third quarter results revealed that out of the $14 billion that the firm had earned in revenue, $6.7 billion came from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. In a quarter hit with inflation, it grew its revenue by 6% and aims to further grow it by 95% annually in the current quarter. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the few technology companies whose shares are up by 1.8% year to date, with others having bled close to half of their value.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) also pays a $1.65 dividend for a 4.76% yield.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in our list of firms that will benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar.9. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is the world's most famous fast food chain and it operates its own restaurants and licenses its brand to franchises as well. The company's diverse global presence has also seen it cater its menu to local tastes.As McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s second quarter ended, the firm had brought in close to 60% of its $11 billion in revenue in the period from overseas markets. Additionally, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s expenses in foreign territories are also in the U.S. dollar, so it has to pay more local currency units to operate its facilities if the dollar is stronger.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) pays a $1.52 dividend for a 2.21% yield and its shares are up by 2.2% year to date. By the end of this year's second quarter, 50 out of the 895 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had held a stake in the company.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s largest investor is Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates which owns two million shares that are worth $511 million.8. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is the world's largest aerospace company that has its claws in several different markets. These include passenger airplanes, fighter jets, and even spaceships for NASA's International Space Station (ISS) and lunar missions.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reported in October 2022 that it had earned $16 billion in revenue, out of which a little over half was from non-U.S. customers. The quarter was an important one for the company as the company generated positive free cash flow for the first time in more than two years after it embarked on a turnaround effort. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.Insider Monkey's June quarter 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 51 had bought a stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s largest investor is Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global which owns 1.3 million shares that are worth $190 million.Meridian Funds mentioned the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Companrseasy (NYSE:BA), a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”7. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is an American company that explores and produces gold, silver, copper, zinc, and other metals. The firm is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is the largest exporter on our list when it comes to the percentage of the revenue derived from overseas sales. As an illustrative example, by the end of its fiscal year 2021 in December, the company had sold $12 billion worth of metals, out of which only $52 million worth of metals from this were sold in the United States. Its biggest customer was the United Kingdom, as $8 billion of the sales were concentrated in the country.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) pays a 55 cent dividend for a 5.13% yield and Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 56 had held a stake in the firm.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)'s largest investor is Robert Richards' Heathbridge Capital Management which owns 517,380 shares that are worth $21 million.First Eagle Investments mentioned the firm in a recent investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of Colorado-based Newmont, the largest gold miner in the world, experienced weakness in the quarter as falling gold bullion prices and cost inflation hurt miners in general. More idiosyncratically, the company reported slightly disappointing earnings and production results for its most recent quarter due to pandemic-related disruptions, ongoing supply-chain constraints, and labor shortages.It also warned that operating costs for 2022 were likely to come in at the upper end of previous guidance. We remain constructive on the stock, which offers steady production anchored in good jurisdictions, a good pipeline of organic projects, a strong balance sheet, and proven management.”6.

In addition, the current quarter benefited from the 100% ownership of Yanacocha compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by lower production volumes from Nevada Gold Mines. Attributable gold sales versus production was impacted by the timing of concentrate shipments at Peñasquito, partially due to inclement weather and earthquakes which impacted shipping logistics. All finished goods inventory at September 30th will be sold in the fourth quarter.Gold CAS totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter. Gold CAS per ounce2 increased 17 percent to $968 per ounce from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower gold sales volumes and higher direct operating costs as a result of inflationary pressures, driven by higher labor costs and an increase in commodity input costs, including higher fuel and energy costs.Gold AISC per ounce3 increased 13 percent to $1,271 per ounce from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher CAS per gold ounce.Attributable gold equivalent ounce (GEO) production from other metals decreased 5 percent to 299 thousand ounces primarily due to lower ore grade milled at Peñasquito. Attributable GEO sales versus production was impacted by the timing of concentrate shipments at Peñasquito, partially due to inclement weather and earthquakes which impacted shipping logistics. All finished goods inventory at September 30th will be sold in the fourth quarter.CAS from other metals totaled $200 million for the quarter. CAS per GEO2 increased 12 percent to $712 per ounce from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower other metal sales at Peñasquito, as well as higher direct operating costs as a result of inflationary pressures, driven by higher labor costs and an increase in commodity input costs, including higher fuel and energy costs.AISC per GEO3 increased 13 percent to $999 per ounce primarily due to higher CAS per GEO and higher sustaining capital spend.Average realized price for gold was $1,691, a decrease of $87 per ounce over the prior year quarter. Average realized gold price includes $1,716 per ounce of gross price received, an unfavorable impact of $17 per ounce mark-to-market on provisionally-priced sales and reductions of $8 per ounce for treatment and refining charges.Revenue decreased 9 percent from the prior year quarter to $2.6 billion primarily due to lower average realized metal prices, excluding zinc, and lower sales volumes.Net income from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders was $218 million or $0.28 per diluted share, an increase of $226 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to the loss recognized on the sale of the Conga mill assets in the prior year, lower income tax expense and a gain on the change in fair value of marketable and other equity securities compared to a loss in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by lower realized metal prices, lower sales volumes and higher CAS predominately resulting from the impacts of inflation compared to the prior year quarter.Adjusted net income4 was $212 million or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to $483 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA5 decreased 35 percent to $0.9 billion for the quarter, compared to $1.3 billion for the prior year quarter.Capital expenditures6 increased 33 percent from the prior year quarter to $529 million primarily due to higher development capital spend. Development capital expenditures in 2022 primarily relate to Tanami Expansion 2, Yanacocha Sulfides, Ahafo North, Pamour and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1.Consolidated operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased 59 percent from the prior year quarter to $466 million primarily due to an increase in operating cash expenditures resulting from the impacts of inflation on input costs, a $95 million payment related to the Peñasquito profit-sharing agreement related to 2021 results, an $83 million payment related to the Ghanaian employment model change and a $34 million payment related to our strategic alliance with Caterpillar Inc., as well as lower sales revenue and an increase in payments for reclamation and remediation obligations. Free Cash Flow7 decreased to $(63) million from $735 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to lower operating cash flow and higher development capital expenditures.Balance sheet and liquidity ended the quarter with $3.1 billion of consolidated cash and $653 million of time deposits with a maturity of less than one year; $6.7 billion of total liquidity and reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 0.5x8.Nevada Gold Mines (NGM) attributable gold production was 267 thousand ounces, with CAS of $1,104 per ounce and AISC of $1,358 per ounce for the third quarter. NGM EBITDA9 was $158 million.Pueblo Viejo (PV) attributable gold production was 81 thousand ounces for the quarter. Cash distributions received for the Company's equity method investment in Pueblo Viejo totaled $40 million in the third quarter.THIRD QUARTER 2022 EARNINGS DRIVERSCompared to the second quarter of 2022, lower realized metal prices, including unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on provisionally-priced sales, impacted earnings by approximately $200 million. In addition, lower sales volumes impacted earnings by approximately $130 million. Third quarter sales volumes were 38 thousand attributable gold ounces and 20 thousand GEOs lower than production at Peñasquito due to the timing of concentrate shipments which will be sold in the fourth quarter. These impacts were partially offset by the $70 million incremental expense recognized in the second quarter for the Peñasquito profit-sharing agreement related to 2021 results.COVID UPDATENewmont continues to maintain wide-ranging protective measures for its workforce and neighboring communities, including screening, physical distancing, deep cleaning and avoiding exposure for at-risk individuals. The Company incurred incremental Covid specific costs of $6 million during the quarter for activities such as additional health and safety procedures, increased transportation. The majority of the additional incremental Covid specific costs have not been adjusted from our non-GAAP metrics.PROJECTS UPDATE10Newmont’s project pipeline supports stable production with improving margins and mine life. Newmont's 2022 and longer-term outlook includes current development capital costs and production related to Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides, Pamour and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1. Additional projects not listed below represent incremental improvements to the Company's outlook.Tanami Expansion 2 (Australia) secures Tanami’s future as a long-life, low-cost producer to extend mine life beyond 2040 through the addition of a 1,460 meter hoisting shaft and supporting infrastructure to process 3.3 million tonnes per year and provide a platform for future growth. The expansion is expected to increase average annual gold production by approximately 150,000 to 200,000 ounces per year for the first five years and reduce operating costs by approximately 10 percent. Development costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $451 million, of which $167 million related to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Total capital costs are expected to be approximately 25% above the prior estimate, incorporating the significant impacts from Covid-related restrictions and protocols and the current market conditions for labor and materials. Commercial production for the project is expected to be in early 2025. Formal updates to capital estimates and estimated project completion will be provided later in the year.Ahafo North (Africa) expands our existing footprint in Ghana with four open pit mines and a stand-alone mill located approximately 30 kilometers from the Company’s Ahafo South operations. The project is expected to add between 275,000 and 325,000 ounces per year for the first five full years of production. Ahafo North is the best unmined gold deposit in West Africa with approximately 3.5 million ounces of Reserves and more than 1 million ounces of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources and significant upside potential to extend beyond Ahafo North’s current 13-year mine life. Development costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $171 million, of which $104 million related to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Total capital costs are expected to be approximately 15% above the prior estimate, incorporating the cost associated with delayed land access. Commercial production for the project is expected to be in mid-2025. Formal updates to capital estimates and estimated project completion will be provided once full land access is granted, anticipated in early 2023.Yanacocha Sulfides11 (South America) will develop the first phase of sulfide deposits and an integrated processing circuit, including an autoclave to produce 45% gold, 45% copper and 10% silver. The project economics, timing and optionality are currently being evaluated by management, and remain subject to an investment decision. The first phase focuses on developing the Yanacocha Verde and Chaquicocha deposits to extend Yanacocha’s operations beyond 2040 with second and third phases having the potential to extend life for multiple decades.Pamour (North America) extends the life of Porcupine and maintains production beginning in 2024. The project will optimize mill capacity, adding volume and supporting high grade ore from Borden and Hoyle Pond, while supporting further exploration in a highly prospective and proven mining district. An investment decision is expected in 2023 with estimated capital costs between $350 and $450 million.Cerro Negro District Expansion 1 (South America) includes the simultaneous development of the Marianas and Eastern districts to extend the mine life of Cerro Negro beyond 2030. The project is expected to improve production to above 350,000 ounces beginning in 2024. Development capital costs for the project are estimated to be approximately $300 million. This project provides a platform for further exploration and future growth through additional expansions1 Attributable gold production for the third quarter 2022 includes 81 thousand ounces from the Company’s equity method investment in Pueblo Viejo (40%).2 Non-GAAP measure.

See end of this release for cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements.11 As a response to the current market conditions, record inflation rates, the rising prices for commodities and raw materials, prolonged supply chain disruptions, competitive labor markets and consideration of capital allocation, in the third quarter of 2022 the Company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. While the Company has extended the timeline of the full-funds decision, assessment of the project remains a priority in Peru as the Company continues to advance engineering and long-term procurement activities. The delay of the Yanacocha Sulfides project is intended to focus funds on current operations and other capital commitments while management assesses execution and project timeline, plan and options, up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure.OUTLOOKOn July 25, 2022, Newmont provided revised 2022 outlook due to impacts on gold production estimates in the first half of the year, as well as the continued impact from inflationary pressures on costs.

Looking a bit further back, gold prices have struggled for the last six months, with the iShares MSCI Global Metals &amp; Mining Products ETF (PICK) shedding 17.5% in that timeframe. Gold producer Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is suffering even worse, sporting a 41.4% six-month deficit. And to add insult to injury, NEM is entering a historically bearish month.Best of November 2022Per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, Newmont stock is one of the worst-performing stocks on the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) in the last 10 years. The shares have averaged a November return of -4.4% in the last decade, finishing the month with a positive return just three times. This makes the equity the second worst performer on the list. Last seen down 1% at $42.43, Newmont stock has been facing off with its 40-day moving average in recent weeks. NEM is off 31.6% year-to-date.NEM Chart October 312022An unwinding of optimism among options traders could create additional headwinds for the equity. Newmont stock sports a 10-day call/put volume ratio of 5.06 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), which sits in the 78th percentile of its annual range. This suggests options traders are picking up calls at a much quicker-than-usual clip.It's also worth noting Newmont stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) ranks at a slightly elevated 73 out of 100. In other words, the equity tends to outperform options traders' volatility expectations.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.98 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.38%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. Would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of -1.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.PSEG , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $2.27 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.59%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.9 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PSEG shares have lost about 13.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.2%.What's Next for PSEG?While PSEG has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PSEG: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.66 on $2.2 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.46 on $8.86 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the bottom 47% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Some analysts cut their initial estimates by nearly 4 million bags as trees have taken longer to recover from 2021's frosts and drought. Coffee prices in August and September traded between $2.17 and $2.21 per pound, over 70% higher than two years ago.The surge in prices gave Brazilian farmers an opening to default on contracts so they could sell beans on the spot market, earning a higher price that outweighs any liability for a default.Several major exporters such as Sucafina, Olam, Louis Dreyfus and COFCO, as well as co-ops including No. 1 exporter Cooxupe, are legally battling farmers for compensation over contract defaults, according to court documents seen by Reuters.Sucafina, Olam, Dreyfus and COFCO did not respond to requests for comment. Cooxupe declined to comment.""We've been told to have less exposure with (Brazilian farmers). It's going to be one or two years until traders forget"" and start buying forward again, said a trader at a large international commodities trading company, asking not to be named.WIDER IMPACT OF DEFAULTSForward selling by farmers and exporters from top exporter Brazil is an important feature of the market. Advance sales help reduce market fluctuations because they allow farmers to sell throughout the year, not just during harvest.Lawyer Cristiano Zauli from Cristiano Zauli Advogados law firm, who assists traders in cases against Brazilian farmers, said he had filed around 50 lawsuits this year against about 100 last year, seeking compensation from coffee producers who have failed to deliver.Story continuesHe said he had obtained court orders to seize coffee at farms, similar to last year when harsh frosts damaged around 15% of Brazil's coffee crop and pushed prices to multi-year highs.Traders said this year's wave of defaults caused the ICE futures price to spike in late September ahead of the front month contract expiry, and could do so again ahead of the December contract expiry on Dec. 19.Traders who buy coffee a year or two in advance usually hedge purchases by taking short futures positions. When futures rise, they take a loss on that position, but can offset it with a similar rally in physical coffee prices.However, when farmers default, traders do not have the physical coffee to sell to offset the futures market. Instead, traders cover short positions by buying more futures, magnifying wild swings in the market.That's what happened in September, when Arabica coffee futures rose from around 2.16 cents per pound to 2.32 cents late in the month, a 7% increase.A lawyer working for one of the five largest coffee exporters in Brazil said the defaults concerned less than 10% of Brazil's total forward contracts. That would still be a significant amount since Brazil produces about 35% of the world's coffee.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Bernadette Baum)]"

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. Just take a look at Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M), which is up 35%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 24% (not including dividends).On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Macy's To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Macy's achieved compound earnings per share growth of 20% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 3.69.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Macy's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Macy's, it has a TSR of 49% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Macy's returned a loss of 18% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 21%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 7% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Macy's better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Macy's has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) share price is up 40% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 23% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 26% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, General Dynamics achieved compound earnings per share growth of 1.6% per year. In comparison, the 12% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, General Dynamics' TSR for the last 3 years was 51%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that General Dynamics shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 26% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 7%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand General Dynamics better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for General Dynamics  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NOV) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, NOV's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, known as a ""golden cross.""There's a reason traders love a golden cross -- it's a technical chart pattern that can indicate a bullish breakout is on the horizon. This kind of crossover is formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average. Typically, a golden cross involves the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices.A golden cross is the opposite of a death cross, another technical event that indicates bearish price movement may be on the horizon.Shares of NOV have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 33.4%. Plus, the company is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, suggesting that NOV could be poised for a breakout.Once investors consider NOV's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months compared to 2 revisions higher, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased as well.Moving Average Chart for NOVInvestors should think about putting NOV on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimates.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). To wit, the NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) share price is 45% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 24% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! However, the stock hasn't done so well in the longer term, with the stock only up 3.9% in three years.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for NOV NOV wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.NOV grew its revenue by 14% last year. That's a fairly respectable growth rate. Buyers pushed the share price 45% in response, which isn't unreasonable. If the company can maintain the revenue growth, the share price could go higher still. But before deciding this growth stock is underappreciated, you might want to check out profitability trends (and cash flow)You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthNOV is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that NOV shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 47% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 6% per year over the last half decade. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(NYSE:NOV) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. NOV Inc. designs, constructs, manufactures, and sells systems, components, and products for oil and gas drilling and production, and industrial and renewable energy sectors worldwide. The US$6.4b market-cap company’s loss lessened since it announced a US$250m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$90m, as it approaches breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is NOV's path to profitability – when will it breakeven? In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. Check out our latest analysis for NOV NOV is bordering on breakeven, according to the 19 American Energy Services analysts. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2021, before generating positive profits of US$180m in 2022. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly a year from now or less! At what rate will the company have to grow in order to realise the consensus estimates forecasting breakeven in under 12 months? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 39%, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthUnderlying developments driving NOV's growth isn’t the focus of this broad overview, but, keep in mind that generally an energy business has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the natural resource and stage at which the company is operating. This means that a high growth rate is not unusual, especially if the company is currently in an investment period.One thing we’d like to point out is that The company has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 35% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:This article is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis on NOV, so if you are interested in understanding the company at a deeper level, take a look at NOV's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also put together a list of relevant aspects you should further research:Valuation: What is NOV worth today?

Wynn shares are soaring, up about 10%, you can see there. And that's as billionaire Tillman Fertitta revealed a 6% stake in the casino company. Now, Fertitta has a long history of success in the restaurant and casino space, including his company's ownership of Golden Nugget. Now, this makes Fertitta the second highest individual shareholder of Wynn Resorts. That's according to FactSet. And he's behind only founder Elaine Wynn.Much needed positive news for the stock here, Dave. That's a stock that's been down 26% roughly year to date. And we know what's going on in China right now with more COVID outbreaks and, really, just COVID lockdowns. We've seen them continue to, no matter what the numbers are. They want to lock down the country a little bit more, it seems.And of course, Wynn has those big casinos out in Macau that are a large portion of the revenue. They've been waiting to see if those are going to come back. Stock probably would have been down today, we should say, with some of the news coming out of China, if it wasn't for this.DAVE BRIGGS: And that's what I was thinking. As soon as I saw you make this pick, I thought, oh, god, they must be down another 5% to 10%, based on COVID lockdowns. But it's not just Wynn. When you look at MGM, they're basically flat on the day. LVS is actually up-- Las Vegas Sands-- up about 3 and 1/2%. So it is shocking.This is totally separate now on Tillman, but the three biggest US-based stocks with Macau exposure are not hurting. And the reports out of China look to be devastating in terms of the business. They've already had a very rough year in Macau. And we're going to show you later what happened in Shanghai Disney and across the country. You would think these stocks would be pummeled, but that is not the case.]"

ZTS will report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3, before market open.Zoetis’ earnings surprise history has been decent so far, having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, will missing out on one, with an average of 6.09%. In the last reported quarter, Zoetis reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.64%.Shares of Zoetis have fallen 36.9% in the year-to-date period, compared to the industry’s 27.9% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet's see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe veterinary drugmaker derives most of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. Zoetis’ remaining revenues are derived from its non-pharmaceutical product categories, such as nutritional and agribusiness and products and services in biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health.The company reports business results under two geographical operating segments — the United States and International.In the last reported quarter, revenues in the United States segment were up 9% year over year. The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the United States is pegged at $1.41 billion.Zoetis’ international revenues in the last reported quarter increased 2% year over year. This trend is also expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for international revenues is pegged at $952 million.Under both U.S and international operating segments, the company reported strong growth across its key dermatology portfolio in the last reported quarter, driven by the increased sales of Apoquel and Cytopoint brands. The trend is anticipated to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Zoetis’ companion animal business has also been performing well, primarily owing to higher sales of Simparica Trio, a triple combination parasiticide for dogs, and the recent launches of its mAb therapies, Librela and Solensia.Story continuesIn the last reported quarter, sales of livestock products declined year over year, a trend that most likely continued in the third quarter. Sales of cattle products declined year over year due to generic competition, a trend that most likely continued in the third quarter. Sales of poultry products also declined in the last reported quarter due to the expanded use of lower-cost alternatives for premium products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. In the last reported quarter, sales of swine products declined year over year due to pricing pressure on anti-infectives and vaccines, a trend that is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Zoetis this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

165,a9e4c648-d864-3765-9f58-7e0f676089af,ZTS,2022-11-01,Cronos Group (CRON) May Report Negative Earnings: Know the Trend Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cronos-group-cron-may-report-140002063.html,1667224802,STORY,"['CRON', 'ZTS']","[Cronos Group (CRON) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 7. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cannabis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.3%.Revenues are expected to be $25.53 million, up 25.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cronos?For Cronos, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -16.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cronos will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cronos would post a loss of $0.06 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.06, delivering no surprise.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

169,9c2e8b7f-7cae-3386-9b43-8e0b1635f122,PDCO,2022-11-01,Return Trends At Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) Aren't Appealing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-trends-patterson-companies-nasdaq-122720895.html,1667305640,STORY,['PDCO'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Patterson Companies is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$235m ÷ (US$2.8b - US$1.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).So, Patterson Companies has an ROCE of 14%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10% generated by the Healthcare industry. View our latest analysis for Patterson Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured Patterson Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?We've noticed that although returns on capital are flat over the last five years, the amount of capital employed in the business has fallen 34% in that same period. When a company effectively decreases its assets base, it's not usually a sign to be optimistic on that company. You could assume that if this continues, the business will be smaller in a few year time, so probably not a multi-bagger.Another point to note, we noticed the company has increased current liabilities over the last five years. This is intriguing because if current liabilities hadn't increased to 38% of total assets, this reported ROCE would probably be less than14% because total capital employed would be higher.The 14% ROCE could be even lower if current liabilities weren't 38% of total assets, because the the formula would show a larger base of total capital employed. With that in mind, just be wary if this ratio increases in the future, because if it gets particularly high, this brings with it some new elements of risk.Story continuesThe Bottom LineOverall, we're not ecstatic to see Patterson Companies reducing the amount of capital it employs in the business. Unsurprisingly then, the total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.Patterson Companies does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those shouldn't be ignored...While Patterson Companies isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Trevo users can now make contactless payments on board buses with contactless cards, smartphones or smartwatches, quickly and without the need for a physical ticket. This system, called Contactless EMV®, is used in many cities worldwide, but Évora is the first city in Portugal to implement the contactless payment system.Ubirider's Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform, Pick, allows Trevo to integrate and combine means of transport and mobility: buses, trains, rideshare, scooters, parking, etc. Users have access to the Pick Hub app, which allows them to plan their trips with more options, pay and use their digital tickets with simplicity.Pick also includes powerful features and tools for transport service providers that guarantee more seamless operations, access to information and payments. Through the use of Pick, public transport operators and cities can make a rapid migration to a state-of-the-art management and ticketing system that encourages a greater use of public transport using digital and contactless means, fundamental in this post-pandemic period.Trevo - Making Évora the city with the most modern transport system in PortugalIn order to satisfy the demand for more and better public transport options, Trevo set out to achieve three main objectives for the public transport in the city of Évora: 1) attract and retain more passengers, 2) reduce the use of cars in the city to free up space for pedestrians, commerce and restaurants, and 3) reduce the city's carbon footprint. Trevo saw the Pick Platform, one of the most innovative and comprehensive MaaS systems on the market, as the key to achieving these goals.Story continuesThrough the Pick Hub app, both citizens and tourists now have access to real-time information to plan journeys and make easier use of Évora's public transport services, as they can use digital ticketing to avoid waiting in lines to buy tickets or passes. Users can now travel with their own digital means: smartphones, smartwatches or contactless cards. During their journeys, users also receive real-time information about transport timetables, bus locations, estimated times of arrival, and more, making the public transport service more predictable and reliable. The elimination of cash payments streamlines the boarding and deboarding process, and allows the drivers to focus on passenger safety and staying on schedule, not spending time collecting payment.The expected reduction in the issuing of physical passes or tickets, usually in plastic, will also contribute to the environmental sustainability of Trevo's transport service, making it one of the most environmentally friendly systems in the country. Through the Pick Platform, Trevo will gain powerful knowledge about its operations and transport network usage in real time to facilitate strategic decision making and improve urban mobility.""It is incredibly satisfying to see the realization of our goal - making Trevo the most modern digital platform for public transport management in Évora, as well as offering our users a simple and convenient process to purchase transport tickets and pay by digital or contactless means."" said Pedro Deus, CEO of Trevo. ""Improving mobility is essential for cities in the interior of the country, such as Évora, to retain and attract residents and tourists. The Ubirider platform represents the disruption of the old way of dealing with processes that we were used to. However, today I can say that the transition was smooth, safe and rewarding, also because Trevo is the first case of the Pick platform installation in a public transport operation. The result is quite good and so I envision an excellent future for Ubirider, even internationally.""Mastercard Leads the WayA pioneer in driving the digital transformation of multiple industries, including transportation and mobility, Mastercard supported Trevo and Ubirider from the beginning of the project to create the first all-digital public transportation network in Portugal. To celebrate this historic movement, Mastercard is launching a campaign that offers a cash-back reimbursement of tickets to those who pay their Trevo bus fare with contactless Mastercard cards on Mondays (with contactless bank cards, smartphones or smart watches).""Mastercard is accelerating the digital transition in the public transport sector in Portugal by providing access to innovative solutions that result from partnerships, just as we have done before in many cities around the world,"" said Maria Antónia Saldanha, Country Manager of Mastercard. ""These new solutions offer integrated urban services and create value for local communities, from mobility to data access, that result in decisions that make cities smarter, more efficient and sustainable - in tourism, in boosting local business or even in financial inclusion - key aspects for the future of smart cities. Residents and visitors to Évora can now make contactless payments in public transport, with simplicity and convenience. Operators reduce transaction costs by up to 80% when compared to classic travel cards.""Ubirider: revolutionizing mobility with Pick Platform and Pick Hub appUbirider has built the Pick Platform as an independent system to connect and help both travelers and transport operators provide more seamless travel experiences. The mobile app Pick Hub, available through the Apple App Store, Google Play and App Gallery, allows users to plan door-to-door travel, pay and ride to all destinations, everywhere, using the best transport combination. This makes Pick Hub the only mobile app in the region which enables users to buy and recharge physical passes directly through the app using their smartphones NFC (Apple or Android).The Pick Insight 'back-office' collects real-time information, stored in the cloud, of vehicle and traveler's flow, enabling any public transport operator to efficiently and digitally manage operation, ticketing, sales and payments, supported by a simple but modern, cost-effective and powerful infrastructure: smartphones and cloud technology.""Our focus is improving transportation - not only to make the experience of using it significantly better, more integrated and simpler for individuals, but also to empower cities and transport operators to gain  valuable insights about how their transport networks are being used, so that, with agility, they can make adjustments to better meet the needs of citizens, businesses and environmental sustainability,"" said Paulo dos Santos, founder and CEO of Ubirider. ""It was a privilege for us to have worked with a team like Trevo, who are so committed to managing and serving their passengers and their city well. This deployment demonstrates that you don't need a large investment or have a large transport network to have access to the best technology or the most modern solutions. It also demonstrates that it is possible for public transport to be managed with high performance, quality of service and safety without the need for complex, expensive and fallible physical systems. I hope that the case we have built with Trevo will serve as an example of success so that other Portuguese operators and cities, of any size, will see our platform as a concrete and robust solution to the many problems that exist in transport in Portugal, particularly to improve its efficiency and interaction with users. They have enormous power to improve people's lives: social inclusion, quality of life, environment, economy, and distribution of wealth.""Évora is a strong example to show how good innovation and well-structured digital technologies can have a great overall impact on the efficiency of systems as complex as public transport, even more vital in an interior city like Évora, with a strong connection to the rural environment that surrounds it. Trevo and Ubirider invite you to experience the mobility of the present in Évora.About TrevoTrevo, a company of Rodoviária do Alentejo, is the concessionaire of the public transport service in the city of Évora since 2010, performing all the urban service in this city.About MastercardMastercard (NYSE: MA), www.mastercard.com, is a global technology company in the payments industry. Our mission is to connect and drive an inclusive digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere, making transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible.

The Pick Hub mobile app allows travelers to plan and choose the best option for each door-to-door journey - whether that is public transport, 'on-demand' services or a bicycle - pay the fares involved and be supported when on the go by real-time information and notifications for greater predictability. The Pick platform also includes a set of digital tools for managing transport or mobility systems, ticketing and service sales, that allow operators and cities to manage these systems efficiently and offer users better quality of service, particularly through digital or contactless payments. The Pick platform is already used by Fertagus (train operation that connects Lisbon to Setúbal), by the city of Cascais and now also by Trevo, in Évora. Pick Hub is also the only mobile application that currently allows the Navegante pass to be charged in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. After one year of operation, about 140 000 passes have already been recharged with the Pick Hub app (17,000 users recharge their passes each month), which has more than 85,000 active users.

178,f3541238-323c-3e7a-8116-2f7ed488c106,QCOM,2022-11-01,Wingstop and Sleep Number have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wingstop-sleep-number-highlighted-zacks-112211500.html,1667301731,STORY,"['WING', 'SNBR', 'QCOM', 'U']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 1, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Wingstop WING as the Bull of the Day and Sleep Number SNBR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, Unity Software Inc. U and United States Cellular Corp. USM.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The key word of 2022 has been ""inflation."" We saw it in every facet of the economy from food prices to housing to watches. The red-hot CPI numbers have reflected this new reality. Recently though, these prices have come down off their highs. The data shows inflation cooling all around us. Food prices have certainly reeled in a bit. In the restaurant biz, I know people who paid $100+ for a 40-pound box of chicken wings not too long ago. That number is now down to $66.That should be a wind in the sales of today's Bull of the Day, Wingstop. Wingstop operates restaurants under the Wingstop brand name. Its restaurants offer classic wings, boneless wings, and tenders that are cooked-to-order, and hand-sauced-and-tossed in various flavors. As of December 25, 2021, the company had 1,695 franchised restaurants and 36 company-owned restaurants in 44 states and 7 countries worldwide.The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is the influx of positive earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts. Over the last week alone, eight analysts have increased their earnings estimates for both the current year and next year. The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $1.57 to $1.64 and next year from $1.84 to $1.92.That means that current year EPS growth estimates are up at 21%, with next year coming in at 17%. Translated over to the revenue side of the equation, we are looking at 25% growth this year and 18% next year. I am sure that new chicken sandwich is helping things along as well.Bear of the Day:The COVID-induced work-from-home (WFH) revolution set about a sequence of events that shifted the behavior of consumers around the world. There was a huge increase in purchases related to making your home life more comfortable. It helped provide a tailwind to companies that sold furniture of all types. That huge influx of money has come and gone. Now, furniture retailers are faced with a new normal, and comps which are going to be impossible to meet.Story continuesOne company struggling to keep up with a high bar is today's Bear of the Day, Sleep Number. Sleep Number Corp. offers sleep solutions and services in the United States. The company designs, manufactures, markets, retails, and services beds, pillows, sheets, and other bedding products under the Sleep Number name. It also provides adjustable bases under the FlextFit, and smart beds under the Sleep Number 360 brands. The company sells its products directly to consumers through retail, online, phone, and chat as well as through its e-commerce activities. As of January 2, 2022, it operated approximately 648 retail stores in 50 states.The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The reason for the unfavorable rank is the series of negative earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts. Over the last thirty days alone, four analysts have slashed their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. The bearish moves have dropped current-year Zacks Consensus Estimates from $3.49 to $1.70 while next year's number is off from $4.20 to $1.85.The Furniture industry is in the Bottom 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. There are a couple of stocks within the industry that are in the good graces of our Zacks Industry Rank.Additional content:Can Top-Line Growth Benefit Qualcomm's (QCOM) Q3 Earnings?Qualcomm Inc. is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 2, after the closing bell.

184,74068e40-e35a-4c32-86c5-1e1e401fd429,PHM,2022-11-01,Housing expert: Homeowners are locked in by their low mortgage rate,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-homeowners-locked-mortgage-rate-211226231-211226914.html,1667250746,STORY,['PHM'],"[Homebuyers who were able to buy over the past years or owners who locked in dramatically low mortgage rates by refinancing are not selling as those same rates climb.“That's going to continue likely for the rest of this year, as affordability challenges really reign [over] buyers' budgets and sellers' decisions on whether or not to list their homes,” Zillow Economist Nicole Bachaud told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).The housing market is in the midst of a major shift as the Federal Reserve continues to hike its benchmark interest rate to tame inflation. The Federal Reserve’s actions don’t move mortgage rates directly, but these rates tend to move in lockstep with the 10-year treasury yield.The central bank’s swift moves has pushed the 30-year fixed mortgage rate over 7%, according to Freddie Mac, crushing demand as housing affordability sinks to its worst level in over three decades.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Higher rates continue to be a burden for first-time homebuyers as they pay significantly more to get a mortgage on a median-priced home. The rapid ascent in demand has driven home sales for new single-family homes to a new low, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.The slowdown in new home sales underscores how quickly both demand from buyers and sellers has withered following the pandemic-induced frenzy. While prices are still up year over year, they’re slowing at a record pace.The average sales price was $517,700, down from $521,800 reported in August, according to the Census Bureau. The number of existing homes for sale dwindled to an annualized pace of 4.71 million, data from the National Association of Realtors showed.“Now that affordability has started to hit both buyers and sellers, we're seeing a lot of existing homeowners locked into their current interest rates,” Bachaud said.BUCKINGHAM, PA - AUGUST 24: An unfinished home sits on a lot at the Windsor Square development August 24, 2006 in Buckingham, Pennsylvania. New home sales dropped 4.3 percent in July and the inventory of unsold homes have hit record highs as the real estate market continues to soften. (Photo by William Thomas Cain/Getty Images)Even with the deceleration, homeowners are choosing not to put their homes on the market. Data from Fannie Mae’s housing survey found that the Home Purchase Sentiment Index fell in September as higher interest rates squeeze affordability.Story continues“We're going to continue to see affordability constraints and constrained inventory throughout the next year in this housing market,” Bachaud said. “That's going to lead to lower...new homes coming onto the market from those existing inventory stock. So that's going to lead to more inventory constraints.”To that point, data from Redfin shows about 85% of U.S. homeowners with mortgages have an interest rate of less than 5% causing the so-called “lock-in” effect to ripple across the country.In Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., homeowners with a mortgage rate below 3.5% were 7.6% less likely to put their homes up for sale in August than homeowners with a rate above 3.5%.Homebuilders, meanwhile, have also been impacted. PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) reported Tuesday a spike in canceled deals for the third quarter, further indicating a grim outlook ahead for the industry.“This [constrained] inventory is really what's going to be keeping affordability pressures on the market and keeping prices from dipping down too low,” Bachaud said.Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. For example, the Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) share price is down 30% in the last year. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 21%. Even if shareholders bought some time ago, they wouldn't be particularly happy: the stock is down 29% in three years.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Baxter International While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Baxter International fell to a loss making position during the year. While this may prove temporary, we'd consider it a negative, so it doesn't surprise us that the stock price is down. However, there may be an opportunity for investors if the company can recover.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Baxter International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Baxter International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Baxter International shareholders are down 29% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.9% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Baxter International (including 1 which is concerning) .Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Another cohort of major utility stocks, including Edison International EIX, CenterPoint Energy CNP and WEC Energy WEC, is set to announce their earnings on Nov 1.Factors Likely to Influence Q3 Utility ResultsThe Zacks Utilities sector is expected to have benefited from a revival of demand in the commercial and industrial groups of customers. An improvement in economic conditions after the pandemic has been generating fresh demand for utility services.Domestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions have been creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities.Investment in strengthening the infrastructure have been allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate the utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulations related to emissions and the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also leading the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations and are capital-intensive. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Story continuesPer the updated outlook of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have created a higher demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.Q3 ExpectationsTotal Q3 earnings of Utility stocks are expected to decline 9.3% year over year, while revenues are likely to improve 3%.For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Utilities' Earnings in FocusLet's take a look at three utility companies that are scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Nov 1 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcements.Edison International’s service territories mostly witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures along with extremely dry weather conditions in the third quarter of 2022, which are likely to have boosted the demand for electricity and, thereby its revenues.However, Tropical Storm Kay impacted Edison International’s service area with gusty winds and heavy rains, causing mudslides. This might have disrupted the smooth flow of electricity to its customers as well as caused infrastructural damage, thereby dampening the company’s Q3 results (read more: Will Edison International Beat Estimates in Q3 Earnings?).According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Shares of Abiomed surged about 50%, while J&amp;J shares slipped 0.5%.J&amp;J's upfront payment is just shy of Abiomed's 52-week high of $381.99 per share.Abiomed shareholders will also receive rights worth up to $35 per share in cash if certain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved.The deal, expected to close before the end of the first quarter of 2023, will add to adjusted earnings from 2024, the company said.J&amp;J is focused on its pharmaceuticals and medical devices operations with the consumer health spinoff expected by November 2023. Chief Executive Joaquin Duato has said he will look to build up the medical devices unit through acquisition.""One of my priorities for the new Johnson &amp; Johnson is to drive medtech to become a best in class performer,"" Duato, who became CEO in January, said on a conference call after the deal's announcement, adding that he was looking to expand into high growth markets.Stifel analyst Rick Wise said J&amp;J's medical device business is facing headwinds from the pandemic, the stronger dollar and supply chain issues that have kept its growth in the mid-single-digit percent range.""It seems clear Abiomed is going to accelerate that growth,"" by 1% or more, he said.Abiomed, which generated revenue of $1.03 billion in its most recent fiscal year that ended in March, develops medical technology that provides circulatory and oxygenation support. Analysts expect its revenue to climb to $1.5 billion annually by 2025, according to Refinitiv data.George Congdon, senior analyst at Third Bridge, said J&amp;J can boost sales of Abiomed's heart pumps by improving the device, seeking regulatory clearance for its use in other heart-related diseases and expanding geographically.Story continues""So when you think about that kind of trifocal opportunity to augment their own market size, the acquisition seems all the more attractive,"" Congdon said.REVIEW OF UNMET PATIENT NEEDSJ&amp;J approached Abiomed after a review of unmet patient needs in the medical technology sector, working internally and with outside advisers before expressing interest in an acquisition, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak on the record.After engaging, the talks moved fairly rapidly, the people added.J&amp;J is not anticipating any regulatory issues given the limited overlaps with its existing cardiovascular products, the people said.Abiomed's Impella heart pumps, the smallest in the world, have been used in the United States since 2008. The devices brought in worldwide revenue of $985 million in fiscal year 2022.Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 700,000 deaths in 2020, government data showed.J&amp;J executives said they believe its existing infrastructure can be used to expand Abiomed's reach outside the United States in addition to building growth through new products Abiomed is developing.Abiomed will operate as a standalone business within the healthcare conglomerate's medical technology division. The company does not expect to make significant job cuts at Abiomed after the deal closes, noting that expected synergies from the deal would be ""quite modest.""J&amp;J's medical technology business includes surgical, orthopedic and various other devices.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks Under $20. Before dividend stocks, growth companies were all the rage as they reinvested capital to grow their businesses. The trend started with the rise of tech stocks in the 1990s that were focused on growth. However, the volatile stock market has brought dividend stocks into the limelight this year. Investors are looking for a way to generate returns in this period of slow economic growth and are turning to dividend stocks. Historically, dividend stocks have shown tremendous performance during inflationary periods.According to a report by AllianceBernstein, dividend-paying stocks protect against inflation with long-term return potential. The report also mentioned that high-dividend stocks delivered a risk-adjusted return of 0.83% from 1971 to 2022 through August, compared with the S&amp;P 500’s risk-adjusted return of 0.71%. Not only do dividend stocks perform better during inflationary periods but these securities have also outpaced inflation historically. Over the past 150 years, dividends by US companies grew by 3.7% annually, compared with a 2% growth in inflation, according to a report by iShares. The report also highlighted that shares of the companies that initiated and grew their dividends in the last 40 years have outperformed non-dividend companies.Quality companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders are less volatile than their peers as they have strong balance sheets. Moreover, dividend growers have also delivered strong returns to shareholders in the past. VanEck referred to data by Morningstar in one of its reports, which showed that US dividend growth stocks fell by 10.07% from January to May this year, compared with a 12.76% decline in the S&amp;P 500.Dividend companies like Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are notable in this regard as they have been raising their dividends for a long time and also have sound financial health.Story continues11 Best Dividend Stocks Under $20Our Methodology:The companies mentioned below pay dividends to shareholders and have share prices below $20.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.72 billion, down 1.67% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.53 per share and revenue of $31.55 billion. These totals would mark changes of -0.36% and -0.43%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Medtronic should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Merck is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Merck, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for MerckFor the fiscal year ending December 2022, this pharmaceutical company is expected to earn $7.35 per share, which is a change of 22.1% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Merck. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Merck to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +160.7%.Revenues are expected to be $6.01 billion, up 75.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.86% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mosaic?For Mosaic, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.54%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mosaic will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mosaic would post earnings of $3.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.64, delivering a surprise of -7.38%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Mosaic doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Fertilizers industry, Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG), is soon expected to post loss of $2.02 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -146.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $527.42 million, down 28.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Scotts has been revised 8.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.78%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Scotts will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Williams is thriving as demand for our critical services continues to expand, and we are well positioned to excel despite the macro-economic concerns for the broader markets. Our natural gas focused strategy and long-term approach to business is built to capture upside and at the same time weather commodity price down cycles like we saw in 2020. As an organization, we are energized by the opportunity to serve this growing demand for clean, secure and affordable energy.Story continues""With the winter heating season now upon us, the need for secure natural gas supplies on a global scale has never been more pronounced, especially as the crisis in Ukraine continues to wreak havoc on energy markets and the global economy, which depends on access to affordable energy. The United States, with our abundance of natural gas, is well positioned to bring energy security to nations in need while at the same time reducing emissions, so long as we have comprehensive energy policies that allow us to build the infrastructure to connect these low cost supplies to growing demand here at home and abroad. If we don’t deal with permitting reform, we will continue to see higher utility bills at home and the unnecessary destruction of our allies' economies.""Armstrong added, ""Williams is executing a number of high-return growth projects across our portfolio to meet growing long-term natural gas demand domestically and around the world. As we bring this critical infrastructure on line to meet growing demand, we expect to see continued earnings growth and value creation for our shareholders.""Williams Summary Financial Information3QYear to DateAmounts in millions, except ratios and per-share amounts.

These improvements were partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses, including higher employee-related costs. The tax provision increased due to higher pretax income, partially offset by the net benefit from a reduction in our estimated state deferred income tax rate.Year-to-date 2022 net income increased by $485 million compared to the prior year reflecting the benefit of higher service revenues as described above, higher results from our upstream operations, and higher commodity margins. These improvements were partially offset by increased intangible asset amortization, higher operating and administrative expenses driven by the increased scale of our upstream operations and higher employee-related costs, including costs from the Sequent acquisition for the full 2022 period, and the absence of a $77 million favorable impact in 2021 from Winter Storm Uri. The tax provision changed favorably as the impact of higher pretax income was more than offset by $134 million associated with the release of valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets and federal income tax settlements in the second quarter and the net benefit from a lower estimated state deferred income tax rate in the third quarter.Cash flow from operations for the third quarter of 2022 increased as compared to 2021 primarily due to favorable changes in margin deposits associated with commodity derivatives, favorable net changes in working capital, higher operating results exclusive of non-cash items, and higher distributions from equity-method investments. Year-to-date cash flow from operations also increased compared to 2021 driven by similar factors.Non-GAAP MeasuresThird-quarter 2022 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $217 million over the prior year, driven by the previously described benefits from service revenues and upstream operations, partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs. Year-to-date 2022 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $492 million over the prior year due to similar drivers and higher commodity margins, but also reflecting the absence of the favorable impact in 2021 from Winter Storm Uri.Third-quarter 2022 Adjusted Income improved by $166 million over the prior year, driven by the previously described impacts to net income, adjusted primarily to remove the effects of net unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives, amortization of certain assets from the Sequent acquisition, certain regulatory charges, and favorable income tax benefits. Year-to-date 2022 Adjusted Income improved by $393 million over the prior year for similar reasons.Third-quarter 2022 Available Funds From Operations (AFFO) increased by $161 million compared to the prior year primarily due to higher operating results exclusive of non-cash items and higher distributions from equity-method investments. Year-to-date 2022 AFFO increased by $533 million reflecting similar drivers.Business Segment Results &amp; Form 10-QWilliams' operations are comprised of the following reportable segments: Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&amp;P, West and Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services, as well as Other.

Definitions of Modified EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and schedules reconciling to net income are included in this news release.Transmission &amp; Gulf of MexicoThird-quarter and year-to-date 2022 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA improved compared to the prior year driven by higher service revenues from Transco’s Leidy South expansion project and reduced hurricane impacts in the Gulf Coast region, partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs. Modified EBITDA for the 2022 periods was further impacted by certain regulatory and abandonment charges which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.Northeast G&amp;PThird-quarter 2022 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher service revenues from Ohio Valley Midstream, partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs. Contributions from equity-investees increased reflecting higher commodity-based rates partially offset lower cost-of-service rates and volumes.Both Modified and Adjusted EBITDA also improved for the year-to-date 2022 period, driven by Ohio Valley Midstream and gathering rate escalations, partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs. Net equity-investee contributions increased as previously described.WestThird-quarter and year-to-date 2022 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year benefiting from higher commodity-based rates and higher Haynesville gathering volumes including contributions from Trace Midstream acquired in April, partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs.Gas &amp; NGL Marketing ServicesThird-quarter 2022 Modified EBITDA improved from the prior year primarily reflecting a $299 million net favorable change in unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Both measures reflected stable commodity margins which included write-downs of inventory to lower period-end market prices, as well as higher administrative costs.Year-to-date 2022 Modified EBITDA declined from the prior year primarily reflecting a $43 million net unfavorable change in unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Both measures were also impacted by higher commodity margins which included the impact of write-downs of inventory to lower period-end market prices, more than offset by the absence of a $58 million favorable impact in 2021 from Winter Storm Uri and higher administrative costs associated with the Sequent business acquired in July 2021.OtherThird-quarter 2022 Modified EBITDA improved compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher prices and volumes from our upstream operations and a $44 million net favorable change in unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives related to our upstream operations, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.Year-to-date 2022 Modified EBITDA also improved compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher prices and volumes from our upstream operations and a $30 million net favorable change in unrealized gain/loss on commodity derivatives related to our upstream operations, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Both measures were also impacted by the absence of a $22 million favorable impact in 2021 from Winter Storm Uri.2022 Financial GuidanceThe company continues to expect 2022 Adjusted EBITDA near the high end of its previously announced guidance range of $6.1 billion and $6.4 billion. The company is also maintaining guidance for 2022 growth capital expenditures between $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion, which excludes approximately $1.5 billion in total acquisitions and follow-on expenditures for Trace Midstream and NorTex Midstream assets. The company is reaffirming maintenance capital expenditures between $650 million and $750 million, which includes capital for emissions reduction and modernization initiatives. Williams anticipates achieving a leverage ratio (net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA) of approximately 3.6x, below the original guidance of 3.8x.Williams' Third-Quarter 2022 Materials to be Posted Shortly; Q&amp;A Webcast Scheduled for TomorrowWilliams third-quarter 2022 earnings presentation will be posted at www.williams.com.

If you want to skip our background of why the dollar has been on the rampage this year, and take a look at the top stocks in today's list, head on over to 5 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US Dollar. The hottest topic right now in finance is the U.S. dollar. The dollar is the world's reserve currency, and it is used by most of the emerging economies central banks as their currency. A key reason why the 'greenback' reigns supreme is the oil and economic crisis of the 1970s that saw the U.S. dollar as the only currency available for oil payments and a safe haven asset. As the Bretton Woods financial system that had pegged global currencies to gold ended, the U.S., under President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia that would allow a continuing demand for the dollar in global markets and ensure that the value remained stable. This agreement led to the Saudis agreeing to sell and price oil only in the dollar, and in response, the U.S. agreed to provide military security to Saudi oilfields.From then to the present day, the dollar has reigned supreme and its fortunes are also dependent on oil as a stronger dollar results in lower oil prices due to lower demand from countries that use foreign exchange to buy the fuel. Additionally, a stronger dollar also helps importers that price their goods with the currency, since they can buy more goods. Conversely, exporters benefit when the dollar is weak since it allows them to sell more products overseas for the same dollar amount. As an example, an exporter that sells a good priced at $1 will see more sales if the local currency is stronger as it will bring in more revenue in the local currency for the same dollar unit.The strong dollar has hit American companies hard this year, at a time when they are also seeing sales evaporate at home due to inflation. According to Goldman Sachs, one third, or 29% of firms listed on the Standard and Poor's 500 index, get their sales from overseas. Some, such as the chip giant QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), end up bringing in as much as 96% of their sales from abroad.Story continuesHowever, the dollar might not reign supreme for long. The latest data in the U.S. point out that private sector wage growth dropped to 1.2% in the third quarter from 1.6% in the second quarter. Combined with inflation figures also being lower than economist estimates, there are whispers that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates. Should this happen, and the U.S. economy slows down, the dollar will lose value and as a result help a host of different firms.In this piece, we will take a look at some of the companies that can benefit from a decline in the greenback value and the top picks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US DollarPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a broad look at which firms earn the bulk of their revenue from exports and then narrowed the list down based on their product strength, financial performance, and market factors. Because a major chunk of revenue of these firms comes from outside of the US, a weak dollar is net positive for them.10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US Dollar10.

Here is what the fund said:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Companrseasy (NYSE:BA), a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”7.

It is therefore becoming increasingly important to help the community understand these innovations so that they can navigate the increasingly complex realm of genomics. To this end, the outreach team at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology is planning to construct, staff, and operate a mobile STEM lab.There is a pressing need for STEM interventions for underrepresented minorities and low-income students in Illinois: 53% of the students are low-income, and that number jumps to 91% in Chicago. Concerningly, the highest poverty districts in Illinois receive 22% less student funding than the lowest poverty districts, the worst disparity rate in the country. Over 83% of Illinois school districts are underfunded, and this funding disparity contributes to 20% of all Illinois schools being ranked as ""underperforming"" or ""lowest performing."" Statewide, 50% of all students are deemed not proficient in science. Therefore, there is a need for interventions that can provide the necessary STEM learning experiences.The IGB has always been interested in public engagement, conducting a diverse range of activities over the past seven years which have catered to over 10,000 participants. With this new approach the outreach team aims to clarify the role of genomics in all aspects of life, stressing the importance of science literacy for non-scientists.With the help of a $26,900 grant from Illumina Inc. and the Illumina Corporate Foundation, the IGB Gene Drive will deliver hands-on engagement with genomics research in areas including genetically modified organisms, microbiomes, antibiotic resistance, CRISPR, and personalized health. ""Growing up in a small, rural Illinois community, it means the world to me to be partnering with the IGB on the mobile STEM lab,"" said Melissa Spears, a Senior Staff Customer Experience Culture Specialist at Illumina. ""I am humbled and proud that Illumina and the IGB are ""driving"" genomics forward in districts where this would otherwise not be possible.""Story continues""We are very excited to receive Illumina's enthusiastic support for this new endeavor. They have also generously donated an iSeq 100 Sequencing System for our mobile lab,"" said Daniel Urban, the IGB Senior Outreach Coordinator, who worked with Illumina to secure the grant.The IGB Gene Drive's mission is to provide research experiences for populations that have been traditionally underserved in STEM education. They will focus on the urban core of Chicago and St. Louis, and rural areas throughout the Midwest. To this end, the team will be partnering with the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District, who have agreed to provide a bus for these efforts. The completely self-contained and state-of-the-art mobile lab will allow the team to travel to economically and educationally disadvantaged locations, providing these communities with the opportunity to access equipment that is usually limited to highly funded institutions.The mobile lab will also provide volunteering opportunities for the scientists at the IGB who represent the diversity of age, gender, race, and ethnicities that are required at any research institute. Together with these volunteers, the IGB Gene Drive will create novel content for the mobile STEM curricula that will address the concerns of different communities. The students will learn science by using the tools and technology necessary to conduct research and, hopefully, will make some interesting discoveries. The IGB Gene Drive will also develop a network of schools, libraries, and community centers who are committed to implementing science education that will meaningfully connect to the unique life experiences of their learners.""At Illumina, we are dedicated to providing equitable STEM education to students and we know proximity to science centers and programs is a barrier to accessing unique opportunities,"" said Vanessa Light, the STEM Education Program Manager at Illumina. ""By supporting the Mobile STEM Lab at the IGB, we can help bring hands-on activities, the latest technology, and exposure to careers directly to our future scientists, engineers, and innovators.""To volunteer, contact Daniel Urban at djurban2@illinois.edu.Illumina, Tuesday, November 1, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/723272/IGB-Gene-Drive-Aims-To-Broaden-Science-Accessibility]"

(NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, today announced a new research test for genitourinary pathogen and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) identification. The Illumina Urinary Pathogen Infectious Disease/Antimicrobial Resistance (ID/AMR) Panel (UPIP) applies precision metagenomics to detect and quantify pathogens, including those that are drug resistant that cause complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).Today Illumina announced a research test to detect and quantify pathogens, including those that are drug resistant that cause complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). In the United States, UTIs are one of the most common infections in the community and in hospitalized patients; they account for an average of 10 million office visits and 1 million hospitalizations per year.Genitourinary tract infections are among the most common community and healthcare-associated infections, and rising drug resistance causes increasing morbidity and mortality. This announcement comes after the October launch of two research tests enabling high-risk virus surveillance, as part of Illumina's steadfast commitment to supporting global preparedness for epidemic and pandemic outbreaks.In less than 48 hours, UPIP, a next-generation sequencing (NGS) based panel, detects and quantifies over 170 organisms that can cause genitourinary infections and more than 3700 AMR markers associated with 18 different drug classes. Combined with the use of Explify®, a fully automated data analysis platform, this workflow provides a comprehensive infection profile across bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic microbes. ""The growing threat of infections by common and uncommon microbes with growing antimicrobial drug resistance is alarming; public health and private laboratories require new tools to fight emerging threats. Our UPIP test represents a unique opportunity for microbiologists and clinical researchers to rapidly identify pathogens and potential drug resistance for complicated or recurrent urinary infections,"" said Dr. Phil Febbo, chief medical officer of Illumina.Story continuesIn the United States, UTIs are one of the most common infections in the community and in hospitalized patients; they account for an average of 10 million office visits and 1 million hospitalizations per year. The prevalence of drug resistance in disease-causing microorganisms (uropathogens) is increasing, and antibiotic treatment for acute infection or prophylaxis often does not prevent recurrent infections.UPIP also identifies more than 20 sexually transmitted pathogens and their respective antimicrobial profile.Current testing methods require culture of the urinary sample as the first line of detection for UTIs and STIs, but many organisms do not grow in culture and remain undetected. UPIP detects and quantifies common and underrecognized but crucial uropathogens with no need for culture. UPIP can also identify slow-growing and anaerobic bacteria linked to UTIs that are typically missed in traditional detection methods.Precision MetagenomicsPrecision metagenomics can reduce the time to learn critical information about microbes from weeks to hours. UPIP is the second precision metagenomics panel on the Illumina Explify® platform. It follows the NGS-based Respiratory Pathogen ID/AMR Panel (RPIP) launched in June 2020 in partnership with IDbyDNA. RPIP targets over 280 respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, bacteria, fungi, and more than 2000 AMR markers. Both pathogen panels offer culture-free, flexible and scalable workflow in less than 48 hours, comprising a rapid, cost-effective solution for detecting respiratory and urinary tract infections in clinical research settings.Beyond the clinical research utilization, both RPIP and UPIP can also bring valuable insights to public health and surveillance, being used to monitor respiratory, genitourinary pathogens, and AMR markers in wastewater and environmental samples.Illumina's Role in Global High-Risk Virus SurveillancePublic health professionals are more often using genomics for surveillance of epidemics and pandemics. NGS has proven to be a more flexible, rapid, and comprehensive approach compared to traditional methods of assessing pathogenic agents. It provides a universal, culture-free method for infectious disease characterization and surveillance.Illumina is committed to supporting preparedness for and response to future large-scale outbreaks and preventing pandemics. In October, it launched the Viral Surveillance Panel (VSP), offering whole-genome sequencing and characterization of 66 viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, RSV, monkeypox, and poliovirus, which represent a high risk to public health. VSP's design allows researchers and public health scientists to monitor multiple high-risk viruses (both DNA and RNA) proactively, using a variety of sample types, including wastewater, environmental, and post-clinical.""We believe that a long-term, consistent, proactive genomic surveillance solution focused on high-risk viruses and deployed globally is necessary to help ensure better protection against future outbreaks,"" said Febbo.In parallel with VSP, Illumina launched the Pan-Coronavirus Panel (Pan-CoV), which allows for the detection and whole-genome sequencing of 203 known coronaviruses and over 370 strains of animal and closely related novel coronaviruses. With this panel, public health and zoonotic researchers can detect and characterize viruses that have the potential to move from wildlife and domestic animals to human populations.About IlluminaIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.

(SO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this power company have returned -2.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5% change. The Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, to which Southern Co. belongs, has lost 2.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Southern Co. is expected to post earnings of $0.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -36.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.78 indicates a change of +5% from what Southern Co. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Southern Co.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Southern Co. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $26.66 billion and $28.09 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +5.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySouthern Co. reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.3%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +24.08%. The EPS surprise was -1.5%.Over the last four quarters, Southern Co. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Southern Co. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Southern Co. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

223,92f0bdca-a0d0-3f77-afd9-bf3cfb7c0870,CI,2022-11-01,"Cigna Corporation (CI) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporation-ci-hit-52-131501246.html,1667222101,STORY,['CI'],"[Shares of Cigna (CI) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 17% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $325.16 in the previous session. Cigna has gained 41.4% since the start of the year compared to the -14.7% move for the Zacks Finance sector and the -2.2% return for the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 4, 2022, Cigna reported EPS of $6.22 versus consensus estimate of $5.44 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.73%.For the current fiscal year, Cigna is expected to post earnings of $23 per share on $180.34 billion in revenues. This represents a 12.36% change in EPS on a 3.6% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $25.34 per share on $189.11 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.21% and 4.86%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCigna may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Cigna has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 14.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 10.1X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 10.9X versus its peer group's average of 7.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cigna currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cigna passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Cigna shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are just a handful of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, which we’ll examine in this article.The NASDAQ index isn’t typically known for its high-dividend paying stocks. In fact, some of the most prominent companies that make up the index, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), fail to pay any dividend at all.The NASDAQ 100 index’s dividend yield stands at just a hair above 1%, which is rather paltry when compared to the companies that make up the Dow Jones index, which yields more than twice that at 2.27%. The average dividend yield of the companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index also stands at a far more robust 1.8%.Those figures aren’t totally surprising given the makeup of many of the companies on those indexes. While the Dow and S&amp;P are known for boasting many mature companies that have stable cash flows that make them safe dividend stock picks, the same can’t be said of the NASDAQ, which features many young tech companies that are still in their high-growth stages.Those dynamics are also apparent in the performance of those indexes this year. While the Dow shot up by 800 points on October 28 and has registered four straight weeks of gains, the NASDAQ has continued to flounder for the most part, down 30% year-to-date, though it has gained 7% in the last two weeks. With investors being bearish and looking to the defensive side of the market to get them through the current economic environment, high-growth tech companies that lose money are rarely on the menu.Some of the best dividend stocks on the market can be found in the NASDAQ however, with yields that top 2% and steady income streams to support not only their current dividend payouts, but continued dividend growth as well. Notably, many of them are not traditional NASDAQ tech stocks, though several prominent tech heavyweights also feature on the list.Story continuesWe’ll take a look at all of those top dividend stocks in this article, which feature yields above 2%. We’ll also look into their cash flow situation, dividend history, and more, to get a sense of how suitable an investment they are.15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Our MethodologyThe following NASDAQ dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy15. NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 Dividend Yield: 2.8% Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) are some of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, a label which also applies to Chinese video game giant NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES). The company, which develops and publishes PC MMORPGs and mobile games, including Diablo Immortal in China, has a variable dividend policy based on the previous quarter’s earnings. NetEase’s most recent quarterly dividend grew by 12% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the company’s five year dividend growth rate of 12.1%.NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has been facing some headwinds in China, most notably from the Chinese government, which didn’t approve any of its games for release for over a year as it seeks to crack down on videogame addiction in the country. NetEase was finally issued a license for a new game in September, but more importantly, Diablo Immortal was also released in Q3 after a slight delay, which should help offset any slowdown in its other titles.Hedge fund ownership of NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has slumped heavily over the last year, falling by 41% during that time to hit a four-year low. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates were some of the biggest money managers to sell off their NTES positions during Q2. William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management held the largest stake among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey on June 30, owning 3.67 million shares.14. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 Dividend Yield: 2.02% Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) raised its dividend by 6.7% in Q4, which also pushed it 33% higher than Q2 of 2021. That’s been a positive development for the company’s dividend investors, which had been saddled with a flat dividend for ten straight quarters prior to Q3 2021. KDP shares currently yield just over 2% and the dividend is well supported, with the company’s payout ratio being less than 50%.Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) deliver adjusted EPS of $0.46 in Q3 alongside revenue of $3.62 billion, results that were in line with expectations. The company also reaffirmed its FY22 revenue and EPS guidance, which called for low-double-digit growth in the former and mid-single-digit growth in the latter. With the company seemingly overcoming the supply chain challenges that hampered its coffee business earlier this year, it expects strong sales and earnings growth from the business in Q4.Hedge fund ownership of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) spiked during the third quarter of 2020 but immediately fell back to baseline during the following quarter, where it’s remained since. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors opened a 1.89 million shares position in KDP during Q2, while Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management raised its stake in the company by 150% during the quarter to 1.63 million shares.13. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 30 Dividend Yield: 3.71% American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) is growing its dividend by 6.4% in Q4, pushing its yield to 3.71%. The company has grown its dividend for 12 straight years and has a very manageable payout ratio of 62%. AEP is transitioning to cleaner energy systems that the company believes will support long-term earnings growth. Its Q3 operating EPS was $1.62, beating estimates by $0.06, while its $5.5 billion in revenue topped estimates by a hearty $750 million.Hedge fund ownership of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) has dipped for three straight quarters, dropping by 21% during that time. Joel Greenblatt’s Gotham Asset Management and Peter Muller’s PDT Partners were among the funds to sell out of their AEP positions during Q2. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies held the largest position on June 30 at 1.03 million shares.ClearBridge Investments owns 780,980 shares of AEP as of June 30 and likes American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)’s aggressive renewables ramp, adding the stock to its portfolio during Q1 and discussing it in the ClearBridge Investments Value Equity Q1 2022 investor letter:“About 5% of the portfolio is in transitioning power companies, typically migrating from coal to renewables. We have been active in encouraging these transitions and added a new position in American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP). AEP has the fastest planned renewable energy ramp in the U.S., with plans to both shrink coal and grow renewables by 50% each by 2030. This would drive an 80% emissions reduction, while supporting high single-digit earnings growth at a double-digit return.”12. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 32 Dividend Yield: 3.48% Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)’s dividend was cut by 11.1% this year and has largely stagnated for several years, with it currently paying out less than it was in 2018. With a solid yield and payout ratio under 50%, it’s still a dividend worth considering, especially given that it should benefit from the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act. BMO Capital analyst James Thalacker has an ‘Outperform” rating on EXC shares and believes the company is well positioned to achieve multiple expansion.There was a big sell off of Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) by hedge funds during the first quarter of this year, as there was a 31% drop in ownership of the stock. Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp and Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management were among the funds to unload their EXC positions during Q1. Ownership of the stock remained flat during Q2.ClearBridge Investments, which owns 1.62 million EXC shares as of June 30, believes Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is starting to be viewed as a premium utility, as revealed in the ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Value Strategy’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. electric utility Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) was also a top contributor. Exelon is a pure transmission and distribution regulated utility business serving millions of electric and gas customers across Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Shares outperformed along with the utilities sector; Exelon is also starting to be viewed as a premium name after its recently completed spin-off of power generation business Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG).”11. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 33 Dividend Yield: 2.55% Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) grew its dividend by 10.7% this year, marking its 24th straight year of dividend growth and positioning the company to join the select group of Dividend Aristocrats next year. The company has grown its dividend at a strong CAGR of 14.1% over the past five years, which has pushed the stock’s yield above 2.5%. The company’s payout ratio is just under 65%.Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) reported Q3 revenue and EPS of $1.8 billion and $0.50 respectively, which were largely in line with estimates, though topping them slightly. Net sales were up by 16% year-over-year during Q3, including 21.4% year-over-year growth in August. Argus analyst John Eade has a ‘Buy’ rating on FAST shares and believes the company can generate high-single-digit EPS growth over the long-term, which should support continued dividend growth.There was a 17% jump in hedge fund ownership of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) during Q2. Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management built a large stake in the company of 1.14 million shares during Q2, while Israel Englander’s Millennium Management hiked its position by 1,174% to 973,277 shares.10. Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 37 Dividend Yield: 2.64% Payroll and HR services provider Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has been steadily growing its earnings for the last decade and the company is starting to get more aggressive with its dividend as a result, raising it by 19.7% in the second quarter of this year. PAYX shares now yield a solid 2.64%, though the company’s payout ratio is slightly high at just under 75%.Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has grown its earnings at close to an 11% clip on an annualized basis over the past five years and the company expects more of the same in FY23, predicting 11% to 12% earnings growth, so it should have no problem continuing to grow its dividend as it’s done for the past seven years. The company’s Q1 FY23 EPS was $1.03, beating estimates by $0.06.There’s been a 37% jump in the number of smart money managers long Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) during the past five quarters, as hedge funds become increasingly intrigued by the company’s growing customer base. Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group owns 2.14 million PAYX shares as of June 30, the largest stake in the company among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey.9. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 2.82% Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) grew its dividend by 10.7% in the third quarter of this year, which represented slowing growth compared to its dividend’s 15.5% CAGR over the past five years. With a payout ratio of just over 20%, Skyworks should have no trouble maintaining double digit dividend growth in the years to come.The radiofrequency device manufacturer is expanding its offerings across multiple markets in the wake of the possibility that it will lose its biggest customer Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the years to come. Its revenue from non-mobile phone products grew by 38% year-over-year in Q2 to account for 38% of the company’s revenue, so it’s on the right track.Hedge fund ownership of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) was flat during the second quarter but is down by 24% since the third quarter of 2020 as hedge funds increasingly shy away from semiconductor stocks during the current cycle. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management also unloaded her SWKS stake during Q3.Heartland Advisors, which owns 119,628 shares of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) as of June 30, discussed how cheap the stock has become in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”8. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 5.25% Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is a Dividend Aristocrat, pushing towards 30 consecutive years of dividend growth. Its dividend inched up to $0.48 in Q3 and has grown at less than a 5% CAGR over the past five years, but with a yield that’s already above 5%, its shares should nonetheless be attractive to dividend investors. While Walgreens’ payout ratio is under 40%, its profit margins are also slim, which could cause issues if its expansion into the primary care field doesn’t pan out.Hedge fund ownership of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) trended down heavily between 2015 and 2019, falling by more than half during that time, and was remained relatively flat since. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management owns 2.83 million WBA shares as of June 30, having 4.64% 13F exposure to the stock.Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity, which sold out of its Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2, discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”7. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Dividend Yield: 4.11% The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) slashed its dividend by 36% in 2019 and it’s been flat ever since, so investors shouldn’t count on it growing any time soon, especially with the company’s margins being heavily pressured in Q2. Still, with a yield above 4% thanks to KHC shares cratering over the past five years, it may be an opportune time to for investors to add a good defensive dividend stock to their portfolios.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) surged its prices by 12.4% in Q2 but margins still fell by more than four percentage points year-over-year to just over 30% and sales volumes fell by over 2%. The company’s revenue and adjusted net income did beat estimates in Q3, coming in at $6.5 billion and $0.63 per share respectively, but year-over-year sales volumes fell again, this time by nearly 4%.Hedge fund ownership of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) ticked up by 19% during the second quarter as hedge funds began taking a harder look at quality food producers in an investing environment turning more defensive. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintains the largest stake in KHC as of June 30, owning nearly 326 million shares worth $12.4 billion.6. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 Dividend Yield: 2.18% Closing out the first part of the list is eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), which has already grown its dividend payments by 57% since first instituting them in the second quarter of 2019. The e-commerce platform made its most aggressive dividend hike yet in the first quarter of this year, raising its dividend by 22%. With a yield now topping 2% and a payout ratio of just 20%, eBay is becoming a compelling dividend stock for investors to consider.While the number of active buyers on eBay’s platform fell by 12% year-over-year in Q2, the company’s strong profit margins should ensure continued earnings power for years to come, especially with eBay’s take rate growing by 130 basis points to 12.4%. There’s plenty of room for further growth in that regard, as rival Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)’s take rate is nearly 20%.Hedge fund ownership of eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) dropped by 20% during the first half of 2022 and is less than half what it was eight years ago. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners both sold out of their EBAY stakes during the second quarter.Smead Capital Management, which owns 2.97 million eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) shares as of June 30, discussed the stock’s poor run in Smead Value Fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”Gilead Sciences, Inc.

TEL is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 2.For the fiscal fourth quarter, TEL expects net sales of $4.2 billion, suggesting 10% and 15% growth on a reported and organic basis, respectively, from the corresponding year-ago fiscal quarter’s readings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.22 billion, suggesting growth of 10.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.TE Connectivity expects adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, indicating a 9% rise from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is also pegged at $1.87 per share, indicating growth of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.TE Connectivity’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 5.8%.Key Factors to NoteThe solid execution of TE Connectivity’s strategies, especially cost-reduction and footprint-consolidation initiatives, is expected to have been the key catalysts in the fiscal fourth quarter.TEL’s global manufacturing strategy is anticipated to have benefited its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Strong momentum across factory-automation applications is expected to have contributed well to TEL’s industrial equipment’s sales growth. Strength across renewable applications and ongoing digitization is likely to have driven growth in TE Connectivity’s energy business. Further, improvement in commercial aerospace is expected to have accelerated its aerospace, defense and marine sales.All these factors are expected to have benefited the Industrial segment in the fiscal fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for industrial solutions sales is pegged at $1.2 billion, reflecting growth of 14.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Coming to the Communication segment, solid content growth in high-speed cloud applications is likely to have continued driving TEL’s data and devices sales in the to-be-reported quarter.This, in turn, is expected to have aided the performance of the communication segment in the fiscal fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for communication solutions sales is pegged at $645 million, reflecting growth of 7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The impacts of the improving Transportation segment are expected to get reflected in TE Connectivity’s results for the fiscal four quarter.

Also, solid content growth and rising electronification trend are expected to have contributed well to the segment’s performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for communication solutions sales is pegged at $2.4 billion, reflecting 9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.However, the impacts of uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic are expected to get reflected in TEL’s to-be-reported results. Additionally, sluggishness in the sensor and appliance business is likely to have been an overhang. Also, the weakening momentum in China might have been a headwind.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for TE Connectivity this time around.

Price and EPS SurpriseANSYS, Inc. price-eps-surprise | ANSYS, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteHigher adoption of ANSYS’ simulation solutions in various verticals like aerospace &amp; defense, high tech, ground transportation and automotive is likely to have favored the top line in the quarter.

Now a new team is taking a crack at investigating whether executives behind the popular stablecoin committed a crime.Most Read from BloombergMusk Plans to Eliminate Half of Twitter Jobs to Cut CostsPowell Sees Higher Peak for Rates, Path to Slow Tempo of HikesHow a Mysterious China Screenshot Spurred $450 Billion RallyLottery Winner Keeps $30 Million Jackpot Secret From Wife and ChildRussia Resumes Ukraine Grain-Export Deal in Abrupt ReversalLast year, federal prosecutors in Washington warned top officials at Tether that they could be charged for allegedly deceiving banks they used to move cash, people familiar with the situation said at the time. But after months of legal wrangling, the case has been transferred within the department, according to people familiar with the matter.US Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan took over the inquiry in recent weeks, the people said, asking not to be named discussing the confidential case. His office, based in the Southern District of New York, has been one of the most aggressive in pursuing suspected cryptocurrency crimes and recently secured a guilty plea from a person affiliated with one of Tether’s payment processors.The unusual decision to move an investigation after it’s reached such a late stage underscores the uncertain legal terrain in the rapidly developing realm of digital currencies, according to former federal prosecutors. The Southern District office’s experience tracking money flows in banking and crypto probes may also give it an edge in gathering evidence or establishing other sources of information, they said.Transferring cases “doesn’t happen often and there’s going to be pretty individual, unique circumstances each time,” said Robertson Park, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine who previously spent two decades in the Justice Department’s fraud section. But passing crypto cases to certain offices could become more common and makes sense, he said. “There’s a steep learning curve for folks who get involved in these investigations and probably a fairly limited number of people who have real experience and understanding.”Story continuesA representative for Tether declined to comment before publication of this article. In a statement posted online afterward, Tether said it is “old news that isn’t even factual.”“Tether executives have had no interactions with the DOJ in connection with any investigation for well over a year and the DOJ does not appear to be actively investigating Tether,” it wrote in the statement. Tether said it does have regular, open dialogue with law enforcement including the Justice Department and that it collaborates with authorities around the world.“It is business as usual at Tether, as we continue to lead the industry in transparency,” it said. “Any claims otherwise are blatant lies.”Representatives for the Justice Department and Williams’ office declined to comment. An investigation doesn’t mean that charges will necessarily result.Banks’ ReluctanceTether is the third-biggest cryptocurrency, with a market value of about $69 billion that trails only Bitcoin and Ether, according to CoinMarketCap. The stablecoin was first issued in 2014, serving as a digital stand-in for dollars. By accepting Tether, exchanges could offer traders price stability, letting them park their balances without being exposed to Bitcoin’s gyrations. Tether’s creators have said that each token is backed by a US dollar, either in cash or other holdings, such as US Treasuries.The Justice Department investigation initially examined those public statements before narrowing to focus on Tether’s use of banks to hold money and process customer transactions, the people said.Tether struggled to connect to the global financial system at a time when many banks wouldn’t open accounts for virtual-currency exchanges, amid fears that doing so could run afoul of US laws against preventing the handling of funds tied to drug trafficking, cyberattacks or terrorism.Some of Tether’s interactions with banks came to public light after Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in 2017 blocked wire transfers that had been sought by Tether through Taiwanese banks. Tether sued Wells Fargo, saying the San Francisco-based bank knew or should have known that the transactions were being used to obtain US dollars so clients could purchase digital tokens. The company soon dropped the case. Wells Fargo said at the time that it had no duty to complete the wire transfers arranged through other banks. It’s unclear whether the Justice Department investigation involves those transactions.In Washington, prosecutors examined whether Tether officials had opened any bank accounts under false pretenses, such as by obscuring that the cash was connected to crypto. The government was considering a so-called right-to-control theory, accusing executives of fraud if they made misrepresentations. Such a case, however, would face potential legal uncertainties, the people said.Right to ControlFor one, while accepting cash tied to crypto might pose a risk to a bank, there’s no accusation Tether inflicted any losses on a bank, the people said. The right-to-control theory itself is under review, with the US Supreme Court preparing to hear arguments in a case stemming from the conviction of a New York developer.Posing another hurdle, the crypto landscape has evolved during the investigation as some banks started helping clients buy or bet on digital currencies. If a case were brought against Tether officials, jurors could potentially hear from witnesses that the relationships at the heart of the prosecution would be allowed today, they said.Last year, prosecutors sent letters to some Tether officials alerting them that they’re targets of the investigation. The notices signaled that a decision on whether to bring a case could be made soon. Tether’s lawyers pushed back with direct appeals to Justice Department brass, the people said. More recently, they’ve sought a formal declination, assuring executives that charges are off the table, the people said.Then the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan took over.Resolving ProbesSome of its prosecutors are familiar with Tether’s business, after investigating Crypto Capital, a payment-processing firm that Tether used once it lost the bulk of its banking relationships.Prosecutors began filing charges in 2019 against a few people who worked with Crypto Capital, including Reginald Fowler, a former co-owner of the Minnesota Vikings football team. Authorities said Fowler opened up several accounts at US banks by falsely claiming they were for real estate investment transactions when the true purpose was to handle cryptocurrency transactions. He pleaded guilty in April to five charges including bank fraud, wire fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He faces life in prison when sentenced next year.The parent company of Bitfinex -- a crypto exchange run by some of Tether’s executives -- enlisted the help of courts as it sought to recoup hundreds of millions of dollars from Crypto Capital. In one court filing, Giancarlo Devasini, the finance chief at both Bitfinex and Tether, said customers transferred more than $1.5 billion to bank accounts held or controlled by Crypto Capital from early 2017 until late 2018. He also said Crypto Capital had accounts with several banks including Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., HSBC Holdings Plc and Wells Fargo.Meanwhile, Tether has resolved government accusations that it overstated its holdings.From June to September 2017, Tether never had more than $61.5 million in funds while about 442 million coins were in circulation, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said last year. A separate investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James found that Tether and Bitfinex hid losses and lied in statements.Tether and Bitfinex resolved the probes, agreeing to a total of $61 million in financial penalties without admitting or denying wrongdoing.(Updates with Tether’s statement after publication from sixth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYeezy Roller Coaster Ended With Two-Minute Phone Call at AdidasMeta’s Meltdown Shows How Big Tech’s Invincible Era Is OverFast Fashion Waste Is Choking Developing Countries With Mountains of TrashThese Five Women Are Helping Doctors Crack the Long-Covid MysteryFed’s Inflation Fight Is Becoming a Battle Over Jobs, Too©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

These companies are the first to report earnings, with third quarter earnings reports coming at the start of October. Accordingly, largely positive results from leading U.S. lenders eased the concerns of many investors and traders, helping to improve sentiment after an abysmal September.Consequently, the S&amp;P 500 bank index is up 9.59% for the month of October, at the time of writing. The broader S&amp;P 500 index, that serves as a benchmark for the entire stock market, has climbed 7% higher over the last month. That’s its strongest performance since January of this year, before interest rates began rising and before Russia attacked Ukraine.With bank stocks seeming to want to continue this bounce, let’s take a look at three of the best bank stocks to buy following Q3 earnings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJPMJPMorgan Chase$125.88WFCWells Fargo$45.99GSGoldman Sachs$344.51JPMorgan Chase (JPM)A sign for JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM).Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comFirst on our list is one of the most highly-regarded bank stocks out there. Investors in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) own shares in the biggest lender in America with nearly $4 trillion of assets under management. In fact, JPMorgan is the largest bank in the world, with a market capitalization of roughly $370 billion.JPMorgan Chase was one of the first banks out of the gate with Q3 earnings, and its results did not disappoint. For the July through September period, the bank reported earnings per share of $3.12, handily beating Wall Street estimates for $2.88. Revenue in the quarter totaled $33.49 billion, beating the $32.1 billion that was expected by analysts. This top-line number represented 10% year-over-year growth.JPM earnings, which serve as a bellwether for the banking industry and economy, bolstered sentiment among investors, especially as the lender stressed that consumers and businesses appear to be holding up despite indications of a slowing economy. And while JPMorgan’s investment banking and equity trading units experienced a slowdown in Q3, the bank offset those declines with greater interest income generated from higher interest rates charged on its loans, and also through a bump in bond trading.Story continuesJPM stock is currently down about 20% on the year at $126.08 per share. However, the bank’s share price has gained 19% in the past month.Wells Fargo (WFC)Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grassSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAnother U.S. bank that issued a strong Q3 print was Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). The San Francisco-based lender is the fourth-largest bank in the U.S., with $1.71 trillion of assets and a market cap of nearly $175 billion. In Q3, Wells Fargo reported much better results than had been anticipated. Earnings per share of $1.30 blew past Wall Street forecasts for $1.09, and revenue of $19.51 billion was much better than the $18.78 billion that analysts had called for from the lender.As the most mortgage-dependent of the big banks, Wells Fargo’s Q3 results were dinged by a 52% decline in its mortgage business, as activity in the housing market continues to decline. Much of this has to do with the average 30-year mortgage rate now at a 20-year high of 7%. However, Wells Fargo managed to overcome this underperformance in mortgage lending by posting a 29% increase in its commercial real estate division. Additionally, higher interest rates charged on its myriad of loans to both consumers and businesses buoyed the company’s results.Wells Fargo executives emphasized that they are experiencing historically-low loan delinquencies right now. This comes despite concerns that the U.S. economy could tip into a recession in coming months. Thus, investors have another vote of confidence when it comes to the strength of the consumer, reflected in these data.WFC stock is down 9% on the year, but its shares have rallied 14% in the last month, including a 3% uptick immediately after its Q3 numbers were made public.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comLooking beyond commercial lenders to investment banks, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is the one to buy. The New York-based company is the second-largest investment bank in the world after JPMorgan Chase’s deals unit, with annual revenue of nearly $34 billion and a market capitalization of approximately $117 billion. As is typical, Goldman’s third-quarter earnings beat Wall Street forecasts by a country mile. The financial giant reported Q3 earnings per share of $8.25.  Analysts had expected $7.69 a share, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue totaled $11.98 billion, versus $11.41 billion that was forecast. Executives at the bank attributed the strong showing to a boost in the company’s bond trading division. Goldman said its bond trading revenue growth offset much of the weakness the lender saw in other areas of its business. Notably, the company underperformed in its investment banking unit, which is focused on initial public offerings (IPOs) and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). Despite revenues which fell 57% in the bank’s investment banking segment, the company’s bond trading unit generated $3.53 billion in revenue for Goldman Sachs, a 41% increase from a year earlier.Thus, this Q3 print was the latest example of how Goldman Sachs, widely-viewed as one of the world’s most influential investment banks, manages to go from strength to strength in any operating environment. GS stock remains down 14% this year and trading at $342 per share. However, the stock has jumped 15% higher during October, following its Q3 print. Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

Novavax Inc rose 11%, while Moderna Inc gained about 4%.Sales of the COVID-19 vaccine have eased from pandemic highs on soft demand for the original shots, sparking concerns over demand over the next few years.In response, Pfizer plans to roughly quadruple the price of the vaccine, which it sells with German partner BioNTech, in the United States once the government stops buying doses and shifts to a private market.""Our COVID-19 franchises will remain multi-billion-dollar revenue generators for the foreseeable future,"" Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said in prepared remarks ahead of a conference call.Meanwhile, Pfizer is also expected to face the loss of patents for some key drugs between 2025 and 2030. The company has turned to deals such as its recent $5.4 billion acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics Inc and its $11.6 billion purchase of Biohaven to beef up its pipeline.While some will point to the massive Comirnaty beat as unsustainable, ""we're not yet throwing in the towel given an emerging pipeline and significant balance sheet flexibility,"", said BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman.Third-quarter sales of the COVID-19 vaccine came in at $4.40 billion, blowing past estimates of $2.60 billion.However, $7.51 billion in sales of the company's COVID-19 pill Paxlovid missed estimates of $7.66 billion.Pfizer earned $1.78 per share in the third quarter, beating estimates of $1.39.Separately, the company said its experimental respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine was found to be effective in a late-stage study in preventing severe infections in infants when given to expectant mothers.(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Shounak Dasgupta and Sriraj Kalluvila)]"

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders and EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company's historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to management, investors and equity analysts to assist in their analysis of the Company's performance relative to prior periods and the Company's competitors.The following table reconciles net income and EPS attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2022September 30, 2021IncomeEPSIncomeEPS$ Millions, except per share dataNet income$613$708Less: Net income attributable to    noncontrolling interests(8)(7)Net income attributable to Fox    Corporation stockholders$605$1.10$701$1.21Other, net5770.14(68)(0.12)Tax provision(12)(0.02)90.02Rounding-(0.01)--As adjusted$670$1.21$642$1.11 NOTE 2 – ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense.Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company's financial performance.

A stunning comeback-- Brazil's former President leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, he beat conservative incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in what was the country's closest presidential race in history. The outcome of the election signals a shift back to the left for Brazil. And it's a wild comeback for the man who was in jail for corruption just three years ago. Lula defeated Bolsonaro with 50.9% to 49.1% of the votes in Sunday's runoff. That's according to the official tally. And also, we are watching Brazil-related shares, including of those of Petrobras. That's the Brazilian state-run oil company. They are lower today on the perception that Lula might not be so favorable to the industry.And the Big 12 has reached a six year contract extension with ESPN and Fox worth more than $2 billion. This will keep the conference's media rights with those networks through the 2030-31 college sports season. That's according to multiple reports. The conference's new media rights deal comes only a few months after the hire of new commissioner, Brett Yormark. Yormark and conference leadership lobbied to open up the Big 12's negotiating rights window with networks early in order to reach a new deal and bring stability to the league, despite the impending departures of Texas and Oklahoma to the SEC in 2025.And the Powerball jackpot. Brad left to go get his tickets. Just getting larger. The drawing for tonight hit $1 billion. That was after no winning tickets were sold for Saturday's drawing. It's the second biggest jackpot in US history. The cash value is estimated at $497 million. The largest pot ever was just over $1 and 1/2 billion. If you remember, that was won on January 13, 2016. But [INAUDIBLE] you may not want to rush out. Your odds of winning-- one in 292 million.- Julie, I'm still trying to figure out how to spend the $1.5 billion I won. Julie, thank you so much.]"

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the ESG investing dynamics and challenges in the industry, you can go directly to read Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022. Over the past few years the concept of ESG has evolved dramatically. Environmental, Social, and Governance principles no longer belong to the vague realm of fancy words but rather play a key role in investing circles. Environmentally-conscious investors and activist hedge funds now pay serious attention to ESG metrics of companies before making investment decisions. Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.Regulatory pressure from governments around the world is also causing the companies to take ESG seriously. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However, as outlined in a whitepaper titled “ESG Portfolio Monitoring – A Best Practice for All Sides” in detail, this pressure is resulting in a backlash from several circles.  Many fund managers believe these ESG regulations sometimes tend to be too harsh, and can affect their ability to perform to ensure maximum returns for their clients.A Key Challenge in ESG InvestingIt’s also becoming increasingly difficult for average investors as well as fund managers and asset owners to assess ESG risks of companies they want to invest in. Apparently, ESG rating agencies solve this problem. They evaluate companies and provide ESG risk scores and ratings based on their analysis. However, these ratings could further confuse the investor. This is the problem highlighted in the whitepaper we referred to above, authored by Steve Glass, the co-CEO of Abel Noser Holdings, a New York-based firm that provides Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) and trade surveillance for investment managers and consultants.Story continuesThe whitepaper argues that because of the lack of standardization and benchmarking in the industry, each ESG ratings agency uses different data sources, methodologies and processes to assess a company. This results in huge variance and subjectivity in ESG scores.The whitepaper recommends using machine learning and AI to resolve this problem. The paper mentions an interesting example of OWL ESG, a California-based ESG analysis company that uses machine learning to process millions of data points from a plethora of sources to come up with consensus ESG ratings. These consensus ratings minimize divergence and discrepancies in ESG ratings.Photo by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used the latest datasets of Just Capital. Just Capital, a not-for-profit founded in 2013 by popular individuals like billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, Deepak Chopra, Rinaldo Brutoco, Arianna Huffington, Paul Scialla, Alan Fleischmann, among others, is striving to solve major problems related to environment, gender, racial justice and equality.Just Capital ranks the largest US companies based on their performance related to issues concerning environment, workers, customers, communities and shareholders. The company comprehensively surveys the American public based on its 241 individual ESG data points to reach its rankings.We focused more on the environmental aspect of the ESG matrix of these companies and talked about the projects and investments these companies have committed to in order to tackle the existential crisis of climate change.Top 12 ESG Companies in 202212. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is an Illinois-based utilities services company that owns nuclear, fossil, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, and solar generating facilities.

Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)’s CFO Joseph Nigro thinks that the new, simplified structure will make the company more attractive for ESG investors.Investment firm UBS agreed with that notion in a report published after the split, saying: ""Exelon post-spin has a clean profile that fits into most ESG funds metrics, even if an exclusionary, already clean approach is used versus a rate of change approach.”11. PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP)PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in January last year announced that it plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 2040. PepsiCo, Inc.

For example, Apple says switching to the Apple M1 chip in its 13-inch MacBook Pro reduced the product’s carbon footprint by 8%.6. PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Payments giant PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced last year that it plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. The company also pledged to use renewable energy to power all its data centers by 2023. PayPal has 13 data centers and 22 points of presence (POPs).

It funded the development of Digital Finance for Climate Resilience (DF4CR) Framework for Action which is working on developing climate resilience among financially underserved populations. The company also supports Catalyst Fund, which helps startups working to improve the livelihoods of underserved customers.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022.

The Zacks analyst believes that Disney+'s profitability in recent times was negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney's leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.However, the company continues to benefit from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. Availability in the Nordics, Latin America and other Asian territories is helping it expand its user base.

The Zacks analyst believes that increasing competition, along with high debt levels, are persistent overhangs. But Broadcom did report impressive third-quarter fiscal 2022 results.Story continuesTop-line growth was driven by strength in cloud and service provider segments. Networking is riding on strong adoption of Broadcom's next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers.

252,bbec8acc-2270-30b6-aeaf-291f094dd605,PYPL,2022-11-01,"DigitalOcean Holdings, Inc. (DOCN) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/digitalocean-holdings-inc-docn-reports-140002141.html,1667224802,STORY,"['DOCN', 'PYPL']","[DigitalOcean Holdings, Inc. (DOCN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 7, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +91.7%.Revenues are expected to be $148.33 million, up 33.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 24.67% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for DigitalOcean Holdings, Inc.For DigitalOcean Holdings, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +9.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that DigitalOcean Holdings, Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that DigitalOcean Holdings, Inc. Would post earnings of $0.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.20, delivering a surprise of +100%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.DigitalOcean Holdings, Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsPaypal (PYPL), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Software industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.95 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -14.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $6.82 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Paypal has been revised 1.4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.53%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Paypal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our background of why the dollar has been on the rampage this year, and take a look at the top stocks in today's list, head on over to 5 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US Dollar. The hottest topic right now in finance is the U.S. dollar. The dollar is the world's reserve currency, and it is used by most of the emerging economies central banks as their currency. A key reason why the 'greenback' reigns supreme is the oil and economic crisis of the 1970s that saw the U.S. dollar as the only currency available for oil payments and a safe haven asset. As the Bretton Woods financial system that had pegged global currencies to gold ended, the U.S., under President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia that would allow a continuing demand for the dollar in global markets and ensure that the value remained stable. This agreement led to the Saudis agreeing to sell and price oil only in the dollar, and in response, the U.S. agreed to provide military security to Saudi oilfields.From then to the present day, the dollar has reigned supreme and its fortunes are also dependent on oil as a stronger dollar results in lower oil prices due to lower demand from countries that use foreign exchange to buy the fuel. Additionally, a stronger dollar also helps importers that price their goods with the currency, since they can buy more goods. Conversely, exporters benefit when the dollar is weak since it allows them to sell more products overseas for the same dollar amount. As an example, an exporter that sells a good priced at $1 will see more sales if the local currency is stronger as it will bring in more revenue in the local currency for the same dollar unit.The strong dollar has hit American companies hard this year, at a time when they are also seeing sales evaporate at home due to inflation. According to Goldman Sachs, one third, or 29% of firms listed on the Standard and Poor's 500 index, get their sales from overseas. Some, such as the chip giant QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), end up bringing in as much as 96% of their sales from abroad.Story continuesHowever, the dollar might not reign supreme for long. The latest data in the U.S. point out that private sector wage growth dropped to 1.2% in the third quarter from 1.6% in the second quarter. Combined with inflation figures also being lower than economist estimates, there are whispers that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates. Should this happen, and the U.S. economy slows down, the dollar will lose value and as a result help a host of different firms.In this piece, we will take a look at some of the companies that can benefit from a decline in the greenback value and the top picks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US DollarPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a broad look at which firms earn the bulk of their revenue from exports and then narrowed the list down based on their product strength, financial performance, and market factors. Because a major chunk of revenue of these firms comes from outside of the US, a weak dollar is net positive for them.10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US Dollar10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American technology company that offers hardware infrastructure and cloud computing services to other firms. It is headquartered in Armonk, New York.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s third quarter results revealed that out of the $14 billion that the firm had earned in revenue, $6.7 billion came from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. In a quarter hit with inflation, it grew its revenue by 6% and aims to further grow it by 95% annually in the current quarter. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the few technology companies whose shares are up by 1.8% year to date, with others having bled close to half of their value.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) also pays a $1.65 dividend for a 4.76% yield. Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 40 had held a stake in the company.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s largest investor is Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital which owns 2.6 million shares that are worth $372 million.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) joins Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in our list of firms that will benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar.9. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is the world's most famous fast food chain and it operates its own restaurants and licenses its brand to franchises as well. The company's diverse global presence has also seen it cater its menu to local tastes.As McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s second quarter ended, the firm had brought in close to 60% of its $11 billion in revenue in the period from overseas markets. Additionally, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s expenses in foreign territories are also in the U.S. dollar, so it has to pay more local currency units to operate its facilities if the dollar is stronger.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) pays a $1.52 dividend for a 2.21% yield and its shares are up by 2.2% year to date. By the end of this year's second quarter, 50 out of the 895 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had held a stake in the company.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s largest investor is Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates which owns two million shares that are worth $511 million.8. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is the world's largest aerospace company that has its claws in several different markets. These include passenger airplanes, fighter jets, and even spaceships for NASA's International Space Station (ISS) and lunar missions.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reported in October 2022 that it had earned $16 billion in revenue, out of which a little over half was from non-U.S. customers. The quarter was an important one for the company as the company generated positive free cash flow for the first time in more than two years after it embarked on a turnaround effort. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.Insider Monkey's June quarter 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 51 had bought a stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s largest investor is Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global which owns 1.3 million shares that are worth $190 million.Meridian Funds mentioned the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Companrseasy (NYSE:BA), a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”7. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is an American company that explores and produces gold, silver, copper, zinc, and other metals. The firm is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is the largest exporter on our list when it comes to the percentage of the revenue derived from overseas sales.

Its biggest customer was the United Kingdom, as $8 billion of the sales were concentrated in the country.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) pays a 55 cent dividend for a 5.13% yield and Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 56 had held a stake in the firm.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)'s largest investor is Robert Richards' Heathbridge Capital Management which owns 517,380 shares that are worth $21 million.First Eagle Investments mentioned the firm in a recent investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of Colorado-based Newmont, the largest gold miner in the world, experienced weakness in the quarter as falling gold bullion prices and cost inflation hurt miners in general. More idiosyncratically, the company reported slightly disappointing earnings and production results for its most recent quarter due to pandemic-related disruptions, ongoing supply-chain constraints, and labor shortages.It also warned that operating costs for 2022 were likely to come in at the upper end of previous guidance. We remain constructive on the stock, which offers steady production anchored in good jurisdictions, a good pipeline of organic projects, a strong balance sheet, and proven management.”6. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60 Caterpillar Inc.

With 57% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$5.0b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 20% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about International Business Machines. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in International Business Machines. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see International Business Machines' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in International Business Machines. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.7% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.9% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of International Business Machines Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$99m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 43% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over International Business Machines. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Customers would visit local branches operated by Ecogas to sign up for new services, update a new address, or visit their local bank or third-party collections office to pay their bills.However, Ecogas knew that digital channels could transform the customer experience, so they began a transformation to deliver seamless online and mobile service channels that allow customers to manage their accounts and pay bills.Ecogas' timing couldn't have been better. In 2020, Argentina introduced lockdowns and social distancing measures to help contain the spread of COVID-19. With in-person services suddenly inaccessible, digital channels became the primary customer touchpoint almost overnight.""We knew that there would be a big uptick in our online transaction volumes, as customers who previously relied on banks and collection networks to pay their bills turned to our digital channels instead,"" Oscar Sobrero, information technology leader at Ecogas, said. ""As well as supporting the surge in demand for online and mobile services, we also aimed to allow customers to sign up for new contracts without coming into a branch - a capability we'd not yet rolled out.""Digital transformation projects reduce IT costs and increase performanceAs its transformation began, Ecogas realized that its existing business systems and infrastructure would be unable to accommodate the projected increase of 20% in annual digital transaction volumes. To meet the new requirements, the company decided to move to SAP HANA 2.0, running on IBM Power10 - specifically, a single IBM Power E1080 server connected to IBM FlashSystem 5200 storage, virtualized with IBM PowerVM and running the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) for SAP Applications operating system.Story continues""In addition to helping us tackle the near-term challenges of the pandemic, we saw that moving to SAP HANA 2.0 running on IBM Power servers would accelerate decision-making and free employees from time-consuming tasks. Moving to the next-generation data platform also promised to streamline important compliance activities, such as generating monthly reports for our regulator,"" Sobrero added. ""With their global expertise in SAP solutions, IBM, and our local partner, The Computer, were able to accelerate our deployment, completing in 60 days what might have taken other vendors four months to complete.""As a result, the new solution has allowed Ecogas to reduce its IT operational costs by 20% while boosting compute performance by 35%, empowering the business to accommodate a massive increase in demand for digital services.Customer satisfaction improves with new digital services""Almost all our 1.4 million customers now receive their bills digitally rather than on paper, which is more convenient for the customer, more cost-effective for Ecogas, and more sustainable for the environment,"" Sobrero said. ""In just a few months, adoption of digital billing shot through the roof, which is a testament to the excellent collaboration between IBM, The Computer, and Ecogas during the pandemic. In fact, around 80% of our customers find the online and mobile channels so convenient that they prefer them to the in-branch experience.""Ecogas also needed to develop robust disaster recovery capabilities to help minimize the risk of data loss or service disruption. As a result, the company created a hybrid environment that leverages IBM Cloud and IBM Spectrum Protect to replicate data to an IBM Power Virtual Server instance in near-real time.This post was created by IBM with Insider Studios.IBM, Monday, October 31, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/723075/How-an-Energy-Company-Leveraged-Tech-Partnerships-To-Deliver-Digital-Services-to-Millions-of-Customers]"

Leveraging conversational AI technology with IBM Watson Assistant, and content insight mining and guided navigation solutions with IBM Watson Discovery, the system is designed to help users more efficiently uncover and analyze relevant patent data, allowing more time for strategic, value-added tasks.IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)Information known publicly before the actual filing date of a U.S. patent application, such as currently held and similar U.S. patents and published patent applications, is called prior art. When an inventor has an idea for a new product, a prior art study can be helpful in understanding the landscape of the field of invention by assessing not only prior art, but also competitors and opportunities for innovation in the field. However, with the continued rise in the number of patent applications being filed and the increasing volume of patent data, finding relevant, accurate information and analyzing prior art can be difficult and time consuming – especially for new inventors, 'Main Street' retailers and consumers not steeped in patent law. IBM aims to help address this challenge and promote greater participation in the innovation process with the IBM IP Advisor with Watson® Demonstration System.By enabling natural language processing of queries with IBM Watson Discovery technology, the Demonstration System can help users locate relevant information using their own terminology, without the need to use specific terms and complex methods. And leveraging IBM Watson Assistant conversational AI technology as a guide, users can ask questions of embedded virtual agents to further inform and optimize their patent analysis.The IBM IP Advisor with Watson® Demonstration System uses a subset of publicly obtainable U.S. patent data and is available for public testing and feedback on the USPTO's Open Data Portal through November 30, 2022.Story continues""Prior art research and analysis is the foundation of a successful product or service launch, but the growth of prior art coupled with the need for appropriate keywords and the right patent classifications can be a barrier to entry for the every-day inventor,"" said Steve LaFleche, general manager, U.S. public and federal market for IBM. ""I'm proud of our work with the USPTO in support of their objective to not just deploy smarter technology, but to build a better, more accessible IP system.""About IBM IBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") of $1.32 declined $0.43 per share.CEO AND CFO PERSPECTIVESIn the third quarter of 2022, Molson Coors delivered, on a constant currency basis, another quarter of top-line and underlying bottom-line growth driven by strong global net pricing and mix benefits from premiumization, while navigating the challenging global inflationary environment. Our top-line results are reflected across industry share in the Company's largest global markets. In the U.S., Molson Coors earned the second highest overall dollar share gains across the beer industry. The Company also gained share in the U.K.Molson Coors continued to deliver against its Revitalization Plan. In the U.S., the Company's core brands continued to strengthen in the third quarter, with Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet combining to grow over a full share point of the Premium beer category and Miller Lite and Coors Banquet growing brand volume. In the U.K., Carling widened its lead as the country's number one beer, and in Canada, Molson Canadian continued to grow net sales revenue. Molson Coors' global portfolio also continued to benefit from premiumization. In the U.S., Simply Spiked Lemonade was the fastest growing new flavored alcohol beverage in the country in the third quarter. In the U.K., Madri has rapidly risen to Molson Coors' number three brand in the market.Story continuesGavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer Statement:""We are proud of our top-line performance in the quarter. Our net sales revenue grew for the sixth consecutive quarter, and through the third quarter of this year, our global net sales revenue outpaced 2019 levels in constant currency. What's more, our ability to generate sustained top-line growth translated into strong industry share performance across every one of our major markets globally. Between the strength of our portfolio and the pillars of our Revitalization Plan at work, we have made significant strides in turning around our business and we believe we are well positioned for the road ahead.""Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer Statement:""We delivered another quarter of top-line and underlying bottom-line growth on a constant currency basis, while continuing to invest in our business, reduce net debt and return cash to shareholders. While we are proud of our ability to navigate the cost environment, global inflationary pressures continue to be a headwind. As a result, we are reaffirming our key financial guidance for 2022 but expect underlying constant currency based income before taxes growth to be at the lower end of our high-single digit range. Looking ahead, we remain committed to continuing to invest in the business and staying the course toward our goal of long-term, sustainable top and bottom-line growth.""CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE - THIRD QUARTER 2022For the Three Months Ended($ in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)September 30,2022September 30,2021ReportedIncrease(Decrease)ForeignExchangeImpactConstantCurrencyIncrease(Decrease)(1)Net sales$2,935.2$2,822.74.0%$(109.2)7.9%U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes$273.0$480.6(43.2)%$(21.0)(38.8)%Underlying income (loss) before income taxes(1)$364.6$383.6(5.0)%$(20.8)0.5%U.S. GAAP net income (loss)(2)$216.4$453.0(52.2)%Per diluted share$0.99$2.08(52.4)%Underlying net income (loss)(1)$286.8$380.5(24.6)%Per diluted share$1.32$1.75(24.6)%For the Nine Months Ended($ in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)September 30,2022September 30,2021ReportedIncrease(Decrease)ForeignExchangeImpactConstantCurrencyIncrease(Decrease)(1)Net sales$8,071.5$7,660.55.4%$(208.9)8.1%U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes$501.6$1,129.5(55.6)%$(24.3)(53.4)%Underlying income (loss) before income taxes(1)$776.2$834.0(6.9)%$(26.9)(3.7)%U.S. GAAP net income (loss)(2)$415.2$925.7(55.1)%Per diluted share$1.91$4.26(55.2)%Underlying net income (loss)(1)$610.7$725.9(15.9)%Per diluted share$2.81$3.34(15.9)%(1)Represents income (loss) before income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to MCBC adjusted for non-GAAP items.

Financial volumes decreased 0.2%, primarily due to lower Americas brand volumes, partially offset by higher EMEA&amp;APAC financial volumes driven by higher brand volumes in Western Europe. Brand volumes decreased 2.0% primarily due to a 1.5% decline in the Americas as a result of softer industry performance and the continued impacts of the Québec labor strike as well as a 3.1% decline in EMEA&amp;APAC due to markets impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern European countries, partially offset by growth in Western Europe.Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis in constant currency increased 9.2%, primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix resulting from portfolio premiumization.Cost of goods sold (COGS) per hectoliter: increased 20.0% on a reported basis primarily due to a $192.6 million increase as a result of changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity positions, cost inflation mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, and mix impacts from portfolio premiumization, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency movements and lower depreciation expense. Underlying COGS per hectoliter: increased 12.0% in constant currency, primarily due to cost inflation mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs and mix impacts from portfolio premiumization, partially offset by lower depreciation expense.Marketing, general &amp; administrative (MG&amp;A): decreased 0.7% on a reported basis, primarily due to the cycling of higher marketing spend in the prior year and the favorable impact of foreign currency movements, partially offset by the cycling of lower people-related costs in the prior year, higher legal expenses and the cycling of the equity income related to The Yuengling Company joint venture which started distribution in Texas in the prior year. Underlying MG&amp;A: increased 3.5% in constant currency.U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes: declined 43.2% on a reported basis primarily due to changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity positions, cost inflation mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements, partially offset by positive net pricing, lower depreciation expense and favorable sales mix.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: improved 0.5% in constant currency primarily due to positive net pricing, lower depreciation expense and favorable sales mix, partially offset by cost inflation on materials, transportation and energy costs and higher MG&amp;A expense.QUARTERLY SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS (VERSUS THIRD QUARTER 2021 RESULTS)Americas SegmentNet sales: increased 6.8% on a reported basis and increased 7.4% in constant currency primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix, partially offset by a decrease in financial volumes. Financial volumes decreased 1.0% primarily due to lower shipments in Canada, including the continued impact of the Québec labor strike, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in U.S. domestic shipments. Brand volumes decreased 1.5% primarily due to an 8.6% decline in Canada driven by softer industry performance and the continued impacts of the Québec labor strike and a 0.9% decline in the U.S. as a result of softer industry performance, partially offset by 3.5% growth in Latin America driven by growth in Mexico.Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis in constant currency increased 7.5% for the Americas segment primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix.U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes: improved 9.1% on a reported basis primarily due to positive net pricing, lower depreciation expense, favorable sales mix and lower MG&amp;A expense, partially offset by cost inflation mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements and lower financial volumes. Lower MG&amp;A expense was primarily due to the cycling of higher marketing spend in the prior year, partially offset by the cycling of lower people-related costs in the prior year, higher legal expenses and the cycling of the equity income related to The Yuengling Company joint venture which started distribution in Texas in the prior year.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: improved 10.5% in constant currency primarily due to positive net pricing, lower depreciation expense, favorable sales mix and lower MG&amp;A expense, partially offset by cost inflation mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs and lower financial volumes.EMEA&amp;APAC SegmentNet sales: decreased 6.4% on a reported basis and increased 9.6% in constant currency, primarily due to higher financial volumes, positive net pricing and favorable sales mix. Financial volumes increased 2.0% primarily due to higher brand and factored volumes in Western Europe, partially offset by consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern European countries. Brand volumes decreased 3.1% primarily due to volume declines as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern European countries, partially offset by higher brand volumes in Western Europe.Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis in constant currency increased 14.3% primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix.U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes: declined 49.4% on a reported basis, primarily due to cost inflation mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, higher MG&amp;A spend and unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by higher financial volumes, positive net pricing and favorable sales mix. Higher MG&amp;A spend was primarily due to the cycling of lower spend in the prior year due to cost mitigation efforts as a result of the pandemic and increased marketing spend to support our brands and premiumization strategy.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: declined 38.9% in constant currency, primarily due to cost inflation mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs and higher MG&amp;A spend, partially offset by higher financial volumes, positive net pricing and favorable sales mix.CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY HIGHLIGHTSU.S. GAAP cash from operations: net cash provided by operating activities was $1,117.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $1,267.7 million in the prior year. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items and the unfavorable timing of working capital, partially offset by the prior year net repayment against various tax payment deferral programs associated with the coronavirus pandemic, lower payments for incentive compensation and lower income taxes paid.Underlying free cash flow: cash received of $597.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to cash received of $933.0 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash received was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and lower net income adjusted for non-cash items and the unfavorable timing of working capital, partially offset by the prior year net repayment against various tax payment deferral programs associated with the coronavirus pandemic, lower payments for incentive compensation and lower income taxes paid.Debt: Total debt at the end of the third quarter of 2022 was $6,587.7 million and cash and cash equivalents totaled $525.2 million, resulting in net debt of $6,062.5 million and a net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of 3.13x. As of September 30, 2021, our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio was 3.31x.Dividends: On July 14, 2022, our Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.38 per share, paid on September 15, 2022, to shareholders of Class A and Class B common stock of record on September 2, 2022. Shareholders of exchangeable shares received the CAD equivalent of dividends declared on Class A and Class B common stock, equal to CAD 0.49 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company declared and paid total cash dividends of $1.14 per share, with the CAD equivalent totaling CAD 1.45 per share.Share Repurchase Program: On February 17, 2022, our Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up to an aggregate of $200 million of our Company's Class B common stock through March 31, 2026, with repurchases primarily intended to offset annual employee equity award grants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased 740,000 shares under the share repurchase program at a weighted average price of $52.36 per share, including brokerage commissions, for an aggregate value of $38.8 million.OTHER RESULTSTax Rates Table(Unaudited)For the Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2022September 30, 2021U.S. GAAP effective tax rate20%6%Underlying effective tax rate(1)21%1%(1)See Appendix for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.The higher third quarter U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in net discrete tax expense in combination with lower income before income taxes. We recognized discrete tax expense of $6 million in the third quarter of 2022 and a discrete tax benefit of $52 million in the third quarter of 2021. The discrete tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2021 was primarily due to a tax benefit of $68 million, including a $49 million discrete tax benefit recorded due to the release of certain unrecognized tax positions resulting from the effective settlement reached on a tax audit.The higher third quarter Underlying effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in net discrete tax expense in combination with lower income before income taxes. We recognized discrete tax expense of $1 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a discrete tax benefit of $54 million in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the release of certain unrecognized tax positions resulting from the effective settlement reached on a tax audit.Special and Other Non-Core ItemsThe following special and other non-core items have been excluded from underlying results. See the Appendix for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.During the third quarter of 2022, we recognized net special items benefits of $5.3 million primarily consisting of a $4.9 million gain from the sale of a property in the U.K.Additionally during the third quarter of 2022, we recorded other non-core net charges of $96.9 million primarily consisting of changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity positions.2022 OUTLOOKWe continue to expect to achieve the following key financial targets for full year 2022. However, the inherent uncertainties that exist in the macroeconomic environment, including continued significant cost inflation, weakening demand in Central and Eastern Europe and the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar could impact our financial performance.Net sales: mid single-digit increase versus 2021 on a constant currency basis.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: high single-digit increase compared to 2021 on a constant currency basis. Due to increased inflationary cost pressures and weakening demand in Central and Eastern Europe, we expect underlying income (loss) before income taxes to be at the lower end of the range.Deleverage: We expect to achieve a net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio below 3.0x by the end of 2022.Underlying free cash flow: $1.0 billion, plus or minus 10%.Consolidated net interest expense: approximately $265 million, plus or minus 5%.The following targets for full year 2022 were revised.Underlying depreciation and amortization: approximately $700 million, plus or minus 5% from our previous guidance of $750 million, plus or minus 5%.Underlying effective tax rate: in the range of 21% to 22% for 2022 from our previous guidance range of 22% to 24%.NOTESUnless otherwise indicated in this release, all $ amounts are in U.S. Dollars, and all quarterly comparative results are for the Company’s third quarter ended September 30, 2022 compared to the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. Some numbers may not sum due to rounding.2022 THIRD QUARTER INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALLMolson Coors Beverage Company will conduct an earnings conference call with financial analysts and investors at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today to discuss the Company’s 2022 third quarter results.

This compares to earnings of $2.66 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.72%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of products used in drug discovery and development would post earnings of $2.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.75, delivering a surprise of 4.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Waters , which belongs to the Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry, posted revenues of $708.56 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.15%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $659.23 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Waters shares have lost about 19.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.8%.What's Next for Waters?While Waters has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Waters: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.87 on $843.56 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.96 on $2.93 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Instruments - Scientific is currently in the bottom 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Mettler-Toledo (MTD), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This maker of precision instruments is expected to post quarterly earnings of $9.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.7%.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company’s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company’s historical operating results, comparison to competitors’ operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this release.Cautionary StatementThis release contains ""forward-looking"" statements regarding future results and events.

The electric power industry is undergoing decarbonization, digitalization, and decentralization. Heading into the last quarter of 2021, 46 out of 54 American investor-owned utility firms had pledged to lower carbon emissions, and many set a target of net zero carbon by 2050. In 2022, even more utilities jumped on board and reaffirmed commitments, driven by consumer support, chances for adding value, advanced environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets, growing clean energy mandates, and potential federal subsidies. The global utilities market grew from $5,488.88 billion in 2021 to $5,937.42 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2%.

The significant spikes in natural gas prices stressed distributors, but Atmos handled over $2 billion of incremental costs with little long-term impact;-Experienced and shareholder-friendly management team, as demonstrated by 38 consecutive years of dividend increases; and-Attractive demographics and favorable regulatory environments in the states where it operates.Attractive ValuationGiven our estimates of higher normalized earnings and dividend payments, we believe shares of Atmos Energy are trading at a discount relative to our estimate of their intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Atmos Energy, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Old pipes and aging infrastructure, coupled with a growing population, have created a large backlog of safety and maintenance projects – completion of which should drive earnings growth and steady dividend increases. Updates should both increase reliability as well as the value of Atmos Energy’s assets, enhancing profit levels permitted by regulators;-Well positioned to source low-cost natural gas from prolific basins in Texas to its distribution network, helping to keep customer prices down and economically favorable relative to other sources of energy; and-Advantageous regulatory environment should continue to support rate adjustments so that revenues are earned on capital projects within six to 12 months.”7.

Additionally, we trimmed CenterPoint Energy (CNP) after periods of relative strength. We had previously increased our positions in late 2020 and February 2021, respectively, after periods of relative weakness.”6. Sempra (NYSE:SRE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Dividend Yield as of October 28: 3.01%Sempra (NYSE:SRE), a California-based energy holding company specializing in electric services and natural gas, is one of the best dividend stocks to monitor. The company delivered a $1.145 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders on October 15.

The conflict and economic sanctions against Russia have brought to the forefront EU dependence on Russian oil and natural gas. As Germany and its EU neighbors look to diversify their natural gas suppliers, some U.S. companies stand to benefit. Within the portfolio, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is well-positioned. Sempra’s previously underappreciated portfolio of infrastructure assets, with existing as well as prospective liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities, should benefit from renewed interest in U.S.-sourced LNG. The U.S. commitment to increase LNG exports to Europe over the coming years should create a favorable long-term demand environment and hopefully regulatory framework benefiting Sempra along with other natural gas and LNG suppliers. Sempra’s core utilities operations in California and Texas continue to generate solid mid- to high-single-digit earnings growth, and it enjoys additional growth opportunities from renewable natural gas (RNG), hydrogen and other renewable sources of energy.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Biggest Courier Companies in the World10 Most Successful Penny Stocks Ever12 Biggest Genomics Companies in the World Disclosure: None. 10 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

267,98fe30b8-6f3a-3b32-8ecb-143cdac09f73,GM,2022-11-01,15 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-ipos-time-worldwide-190207873.html,1667242927,STORY,"['ABNB', 'RIVN', 'UPS', 'UBER', 'BABA', 'META', 'MBLY', 'GM', 'V']","[In this article, we discuss the 15 largest IPOs of all time. If you want to read about some more popular IPOs, go directly to 5 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide. As of September 28, 2022, there have been a total of 992 IPOs year-to-date, raising $146 billion, a 44% and 57% decrease year-over-year, respectively. IPO companies and investors faced heightening macroeconomic challenges, market uncertainties, growing volatility, and declining global equity prices. Volatility (CBOE VIX average) rose from 19.7 in 2021 to 25.6 year-to-date in 2022. The technology sector led IPOs in terms of the number of IPOs, although the average deal size dropped from $261 million to $123 million year-over-year. Q3 2022 had the least SPAC IPO proceeds since Q3 2016, and SPACs struggled to find proper targets. Similarly, as of October 2022, NASDAQ has halted the initial public offering (IPO) preparations of at least four small Chinese firms as it probes the limited rallies of such firms after their market debuts, as per lawyers and bankers who are part of these IPOs. NASDAQ took this action as Chinese companies that raise nearly $50 million or less in their IPOs gain about 2,000% during their market debut, only to plummet in the following days. This crushes investors who are daring enough to bet on penny stocks. As per an EY report dated September 30, U.S. initial public offerings (IPOs) dropped 74% during the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, bludgeoned by market volatility, high inflation, rising interest rates, and threats posed by COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rachel Gerring, the IPO leader in EY Americas, noted that the market needs more stability. 2021 was a record year for IPOs, and she said that those firms “have severely underperformed in the aftermarket, significantly impacting companies’ desires to go public as they navigate ongoing market volatility.”There were 83 IPOs in the United States during the first three quarters of 2022, generating $7.27 billion, representing the least rate of proceeds since 2003, EY said. More than 53% of the IPOs in the first three quarters of 2022 decided to list on Chinese exchanges, including Hong Kong. This year’s quarterly growth demonstrates how China’s IPO market has shown meaningful strength in recent years, drawing upon a robust pipeline of industrial, technology, and consumer non-cyclical companies. Story continuesNearly 75% of large US companies that went public during the pandemic are now trading under their IPO price, pushing some rising start-ups back to private buyers at low valuations. Of more than 400 IPO listings where companies raised at least $100 million between 2019 and 2021, 76% are now trading below their IPO prices, as per Financial Times data. The group’s median return since their IPO dates is negative 44%. The IPO firms which sank this year include overhyped names like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), all of whom were publicly listed during a pandemic-driven market surge that concluded in late 2021.Although the global IPO market has faced large declines in 2022, some of the largest IPOs of all time are still thriving. These companies have carved out strategic market positions for themselves over the years. With this outlook in mind, let’s dive into 15 largest IPOs of all time worldwide. 15 Largest IPOs of All Time WorldwideImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology We selected the largest IPOs in the world based on the capital raised and the buzz around the firms at the time of their IPOs. We have mentioned the details of the initial public offerings with each company for additional context.Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15. Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $21.818 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $16.7 billion Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced on December 6, 2021 that it is separating its Mobileye division via an IPO. On October 25, 2022, Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY) disclosed an initial public offering of 41 million units of its Class A common stock at an IPO price of $21.00 per share, which is higher than the priorly announced per share price of $18-$20. The stock started trading on NASDAQ on October 26. The market cap of Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY) came in at nearly $22 billion on October 28. Mobileye was previously publicly traded before Intel acquired the Israeli company in 2017 for $15.3 billion. It is one of the most notable IPOs of 2022, and the stock price has climbed almost 37% to $27 as of October 28. Mobileye develops autonomous driving technologies and complex driver-assistance systems.Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY) has made huge headlines with its IPO, just like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH). 14. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $178.715 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $25 billionIn 2014, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was considered to be one of the largest global IPOs, raising $25 billion at $68 per share. The stock surged 38% on the first day of trading. Alibaba is one of the largest Chinese tech giants, and it is dually listed in the US and Hong Kong. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) declined 30% during the quarter primarily due to the continued impact of China’s zero-COVID policy. In August, more than 70 Chinese cities with 300 million combined population were in some state of lockdown. Unfortunately, this comes on top of the other regulatory and competitive challenges that had previously been pressuring Alibaba’s shares over the past year. The painful decline in the share price has made Alibaba a poor investment so far—for good reason. In the second quarter, core online e-commerce revenues were down 10%, and adjusted profits declined 18%. That said, Alibaba shares are priced for this terrible environment to continue forever, and many of the exogenous issues should eventually abate. Signs suggest the regulatory pressure is already easing. The government has been stepping in with economic stimulus. The zero-COVID policy must eventually end. In addition, Alibaba’s management has taken important steps to improve profitability by reducing investments in loss-making new business ventures. When the environment improves, we believe that Alibaba’s core business franchises will return to growth, and profits will follow. The disconnect between Alibaba’s price and value continues to be one of the biggest we have seen in our careers.”13. SoftBank Group CorpMarket Capitalization as of October 28: $63.7 billion  Amount Raised at IPO: $23.5 billionJapan’s SoftBank Corp started trading publicly in December 2018, and it was one of the largest IPOs the world had seen. SoftBank Corp is the telecoms division of Japanese billionaire CEO Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group. SoftBank Corp raised 2.65 trillion yen, or $23.5 billion, after pricing the IPO units at 1,500 yen per share. The market capitalization as of October 28 stood at nearly $64 billion. 12. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $430.523 billion  Amount Raised at IPO: $17.9 billionVisa Inc. (NYSE:V), the American multinational payments technology firm, had its IPO in March 2008. The company raised $17.9 billion as investors jumped on its growth potential coming out of the US mortgage crisis. Visa sold 406 million class A common stock for $44 per share, above the forecast $37-$42. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is partnering with blockchain firms to offer crypto debit cards, a new offering in addition to its card products, payment platforms, and value-added services.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We reinitiated a small position in Visa, which we had previously owned for years (selling out of the position at higher levels in February). We continue to believe that the long-term secular growth trend towards digital payments remains intact and has been further enhanced by the COVID crisis. The growth in debit cards, contactless payments, e-commerce, and now, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), are all driving digital payment penetration, and we continue to be impressed with the long-term growth potential of V (and our other payment holdings Mastercard, Adyen, and PayPal).”11. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $73.223 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $3.5 billionAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), the California-based travel technology firm, had a massive initial public offering in 2020. The company opened at $146 per share on the NASDAQ, far ahead of the IPO price of $68 per share. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) amassed a market cap of about $86.5 billion, more than double the IPO valuation it sought a day earlier. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is one of the best IPO stocks of all time. Here is what Polen Capital specifically said about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) was one of our largest detractors from performance in the second quarter. Airbnb is the clear market leader in private rental bookings globally, according to market research firm Euromonitor. The business is currently firing on all cylinders, with revenue and earnings growth well above our expectations and long-term estimates. It would be easy to say that it is because as the world reopens, people are traveling for the first time in two years, providing a short-term benefit to the company. But, Airbnb also grew quickly in 2021 when people were still hesitant to travel and preferred staying close to home. The company’s growth in 2022 is not an easy comparison like it is for online travel agencies (which are more hotel-oriented), airlines, and hotels. In fact, Airbnb’s business has outpaced the hotel industry growth by more than 1,250 basis points per year since 2019, showing far more resilience than hotels and online travel agencies.Airbnb didn’t invent the private rental market, but it developed a better offering and helped it scale with robust network effects and a system of trust protecting travelers and hosts alike. It has diligently removed friction from the marketplace to catalyze demand.The business model has very high incremental profit margins. When the company went public only a year and a half ago, it had pretax profit margins on a non-GAAP basis of approximately 5% by our calculations. This year, those margins should approach 30%. In addition, the company has generated approximately $3 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. The runway for growth in private rental is very long, especially considering that hybrid work will likely remain for the long-term, allowing for more business/leisure trips that work better in Airbnbs than hotels, in our view…” (Click here to read full text)10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $266.215 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $16 billionMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) debuted on the NASDAQ on May 18, 2012. The initial public offering of 421.23 million shares was priced at $38 each, and the trade opened at $42.05 per share, a gain of approximately 11%. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was thus worth over $100 billion and managed to raise $16 billion by selling its initial shares. It was one of the largest tech IPOs in the world. Meta is valued at more than $266 billion as of October 28, and it is one of the biggest companies in the world by market cap. Here is what Giverny Capital specifically said about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Our worst performers for the year-to-date have been painful. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is down roughly 60%, and Carmax, Eurofins Scientific, Coherent and Ciena have lost about half their value. I’m wearing a dunce cap for Meta, as the changes Apple made to privacy tracking severely impacted Meta’s effectiveness at targeting ads to the right consumers. However, despite being compared recently to AOL by one analyst, Meta continues to capture enormous amounts of consumer attention: roughly 2.9 billion people use one of its sites every day. I believe it has a very long runway on monetizing those eyeballs, especially outside North America. For all its problems with ad tracking, and despite heavy investment in the so called metaverse, Meta should earn about $10 per share in 2022 and more next year. The stock, at $136 on September 30, reflects pessimism that Meta will ever recover. We’re holding because we think that Meta has the resources to improve its advertising efficiency, and that it eventually will.”9. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $56.55 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $15.77 billionGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM), the American automaker manufacturing trucks, crossovers, and electric cars, had one of the largest IPOs of all time in November 2010. The company sold 478 million common shares priced at $33 each, raising $15.77 billion, as well as $4.35 billion in preferred stock, higher than the initially planned $4 billion. As of October 28, 2022, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has a market cap of more than $56.5 billion. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital specifically said about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Auto manufacturer General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) was also among our bottom contributors in Q2. Rising interest rates and continued supply chain issues have increased uncertainty surrounding the auto industry, exerting downward pressure on stocks of auto makers. We continue to like GM’s focus on its most profitable market segments (SUV, crossovers, trucks) and believe the company’s heavy investments in autonomous capabilities will position it favorably as the secular movement towards autonomous vehicles continues.”8. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $30.477 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $12 billion Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and related accessories. The IPO was priced at $78 a share, valuing Rivian at $66.5 billion. The Amazon-backed electric vehicle maker had a market valuation exceeding $100 billion a day after its IPO on November 9, 2021. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) was one of the largest IPOs of 2021. Here is what Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund has to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Rivian Automotive, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells consumer and commercial electric vehicles. Shares of Rivian declined 48.2% in the second quarter as investors continued rotating out of long-duration assets and have become increasingly concerned about capital intensity and cash burn.At the same time, Rivian continues to be impacted by supply chain issues which are causing delays in its production ramp. Rivian is addressing those challenges by diversifying its supply chain to alleviate shortages while also consolidating the number of variants in development to reduce cash burn (the company guided that current cash will be enough to support the company’s future platform launch ‘R2’ in 2025). Rivian recently reported stronger-than-expected second quarter production numbers while reiterating its annual guidance of producing 25,000 units.As semiconductor shortages ease, we believe that the company will be able to rapidly ramp its production. We retain conviction in the shares given management’s vision, Rivian’s product positioning, the company’s relationship with Amazon.com, and its strong balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, Rivian had $17 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which will help it overcome the current challenges while taking advantage of the long-term opportunity as the market transitions to electric vehicles.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $54.576 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $8.1 billionUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), the American firm providing technology-led ride sharing services, features as one of the largest IPOs of all time worldwide. Uber listed publicly on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10, 2019, with an IPO price of $45 per share. Bankers floated a valuation of about $120 billion for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), however, the mobility firm did not touch that figure. As of October 28, 2022, Uber is valued at nearly $55 billion. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Uber was our top contributor for the quarter on better-than-expected 2Q results, and 3Q EBITDA guidance that was well ahead of Street estimates. The company reported 33% Gross Bookings growth from both the continued recovery of Mobility Gross Bookings, up 55% year over year, and the continuation of Delivery Gross Bookings growth, up 7% year over year. Overall, revenue grew 105% year over year to $8 billion, generating $364 million of adjusted EBITDA, up $873 million year over year. Management guided to 25%-30% gross bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA of $440-$470 million for 3Q. Significantly, FCF was positive at $382 million, up $780 million year over year, and remains on track to be positive for the year allowing the company to self-fund future growth.UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the expectation of substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its more than 120 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as grocery delivery, truck brokerage (the company had $1.8 billion in Freight revenue for 2Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $10 billion of cash and investments against $9 billion of debt, the company today has an enterprise value of $57 billion indicating that UBER trades at only 1.5x next year’s estimated revenue.”6. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $144.634 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $5.5 billionUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is an American company that provides letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services. On November 10, 1999, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) offered 109,400,000 shares on the NYSE. The IPO stock price was $50 per share. The stock closed its first day with a 35% gain. It was one of the largest IPOs of all time worldwide. The current market cap, as of October 28, stands at nearly $145 billion. Although IPO firms like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) failed to dazzle the market, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is one of the most successful IPOs of all time. Here is what ClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG Strategy has to say about United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide.  Suggested articles:Most Educated Countries in the WorldBest Stocks For Beginners with Little MoneyBest Shipping and Container Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

LG Energy did not immediately comment.In May, President Joe Biden, in a trip to South Korea, expressed support for workers seeking to unionize joint venture battery plants. Detroit's Big Three automakers all have battery plants in the works with Korean partners.""For every joint venture that manufactures electric vehicle batteries would be made stronger by collective bargaining relationships with American unions,"" Biden said.South Korea and the Biden administration have sparred over a U.S. decision in August to revise a tax credit making all EVs assembled outside North America immediately ineligible for tax credits, including all current Hyundai GM.N and Kia EVs for sale in the United States.GM and LG Energy are considering an Indiana site for a fourth U.S. battery plant expected to cost about $2.5 billion. They are already building a $2.6 billion battery cell plant in Michigan, set to open in 2024, and a $2.3 billion Tennessee plant to be completed in 2023.The White House did not immediately comment on the UAW statement.

Pinnacle West (PNW), which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This power company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 105.77%.For the last reported quarter, Pinnacle West came out with earnings of $1.45 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 per share, representing a surprise of 11.54%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.05 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.15 per share, delivering a surprise of 200%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Pinnacle West, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Pinnacle West has an Earnings ESP of +1.66% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 3, 2022.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(NASDAQ:ISRG)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-intuitive-surgical-110039913.html,1667300439.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Does the November share price for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.13bUS$2.47bUS$2.71bUS$3.10bUS$3.39bUS$3.62bUS$3.82bUS$3.99bUS$4.14bUS$4.27bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.15%Est @ 7%Est @ 5.5%Est @ 4.44%Est @ 3.7%Est @ 3.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.0%) = US$104bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$104b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$57bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$81b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$246, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.894. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Intuitive Surgical, we've put together three relevant aspects you should further research:Financial Health: Does ISRG have a healthy balance sheet?

(NASDAQ:ROST) is a Dublin, California-based discount store company with a $32.8 billion market capitalization. Ross Stores, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""Ross Stores is one of our longest-tenured holdings. Its profits have gyrated wildly since the beginning of the pandemic, first from store closures and shutdowns, then from the pent-up demand for apparel, and more recently, from the economic uncertainty. Adding to that, Ross is finding that consumers’ spending trends in terms of mix and categories have been more difficult to predict than usual, resulting in some mismatches between its merchandise assortment and what shoppers want. This doesn’t appear to be a Ross-specific issue, as other apparel retailers have reported similar problems. We attribute this to the unusual post-pandemic environment, and while we don’t have a crystal ball as to when this will normalize, we believe it will.""Photo by Franki Chamaki on UnsplashOur calculations show that Ross Stores, Inc.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Ross Stores is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$13b - US$3.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).Therefore, Ross Stores has an ROCE of 21%. On its own, that's a very good return and it's on par with the returns earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Ross Stores roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Ross Stores compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Ross Stores here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Ross Stores' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 51%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom Line On Ross Stores' ROCETo conclude, we've found that Ross Stores is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 56% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Ross Stores that you might find interesting.Ross Stores is not the only stock earning high returns.

Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for SBA Communications: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

""Our results evidence the high levels of wireless deployment across our markets, driven mostly by 5G domestically and 4G in our international markets. Wireless carrier activity was, and remains, robust across most of our markets.

291,98fe30b8-6f3a-3b32-8ecb-143cdac09f73,V,2022-11-01,15 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-ipos-time-worldwide-190207873.html,1667242927,STORY,"['ABNB', 'RIVN', 'UPS', 'UBER', 'BABA', 'META', 'MBLY', 'GM', 'V']","[In this article, we discuss the 15 largest IPOs of all time. If you want to read about some more popular IPOs, go directly to 5 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide. As of September 28, 2022, there have been a total of 992 IPOs year-to-date, raising $146 billion, a 44% and 57% decrease year-over-year, respectively. IPO companies and investors faced heightening macroeconomic challenges, market uncertainties, growing volatility, and declining global equity prices. Volatility (CBOE VIX average) rose from 19.7 in 2021 to 25.6 year-to-date in 2022. The technology sector led IPOs in terms of the number of IPOs, although the average deal size dropped from $261 million to $123 million year-over-year. Q3 2022 had the least SPAC IPO proceeds since Q3 2016, and SPACs struggled to find proper targets. Similarly, as of October 2022, NASDAQ has halted the initial public offering (IPO) preparations of at least four small Chinese firms as it probes the limited rallies of such firms after their market debuts, as per lawyers and bankers who are part of these IPOs. NASDAQ took this action as Chinese companies that raise nearly $50 million or less in their IPOs gain about 2,000% during their market debut, only to plummet in the following days. This crushes investors who are daring enough to bet on penny stocks. As per an EY report dated September 30, U.S. initial public offerings (IPOs) dropped 74% during the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, bludgeoned by market volatility, high inflation, rising interest rates, and threats posed by COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rachel Gerring, the IPO leader in EY Americas, noted that the market needs more stability. 2021 was a record year for IPOs, and she said that those firms “have severely underperformed in the aftermarket, significantly impacting companies’ desires to go public as they navigate ongoing market volatility.”There were 83 IPOs in the United States during the first three quarters of 2022, generating $7.27 billion, representing the least rate of proceeds since 2003, EY said. More than 53% of the IPOs in the first three quarters of 2022 decided to list on Chinese exchanges, including Hong Kong. This year’s quarterly growth demonstrates how China’s IPO market has shown meaningful strength in recent years, drawing upon a robust pipeline of industrial, technology, and consumer non-cyclical companies. Story continuesNearly 75% of large US companies that went public during the pandemic are now trading under their IPO price, pushing some rising start-ups back to private buyers at low valuations. Of more than 400 IPO listings where companies raised at least $100 million between 2019 and 2021, 76% are now trading below their IPO prices, as per Financial Times data. The group’s median return since their IPO dates is negative 44%. The IPO firms which sank this year include overhyped names like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), all of whom were publicly listed during a pandemic-driven market surge that concluded in late 2021.Although the global IPO market has faced large declines in 2022, some of the largest IPOs of all time are still thriving. These companies have carved out strategic market positions for themselves over the years. With this outlook in mind, let’s dive into 15 largest IPOs of all time worldwide. 15 Largest IPOs of All Time WorldwideImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology We selected the largest IPOs in the world based on the capital raised and the buzz around the firms at the time of their IPOs. We have mentioned the details of the initial public offerings with each company for additional context.Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15. Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $21.818 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $16.7 billion Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced on December 6, 2021 that it is separating its Mobileye division via an IPO. On October 25, 2022, Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY) disclosed an initial public offering of 41 million units of its Class A common stock at an IPO price of $21.00 per share, which is higher than the priorly announced per share price of $18-$20. The stock started trading on NASDAQ on October 26. The market cap of Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY) came in at nearly $22 billion on October 28. Mobileye was previously publicly traded before Intel acquired the Israeli company in 2017 for $15.3 billion. It is one of the most notable IPOs of 2022, and the stock price has climbed almost 37% to $27 as of October 28. Mobileye develops autonomous driving technologies and complex driver-assistance systems.Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY) has made huge headlines with its IPO, just like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH). 14. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $178.715 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $25 billionIn 2014, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was considered to be one of the largest global IPOs, raising $25 billion at $68 per share. The stock surged 38% on the first day of trading. Alibaba is one of the largest Chinese tech giants, and it is dually listed in the US and Hong Kong. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) declined 30% during the quarter primarily due to the continued impact of China’s zero-COVID policy. In August, more than 70 Chinese cities with 300 million combined population were in some state of lockdown. Unfortunately, this comes on top of the other regulatory and competitive challenges that had previously been pressuring Alibaba’s shares over the past year. The painful decline in the share price has made Alibaba a poor investment so far—for good reason. In the second quarter, core online e-commerce revenues were down 10%, and adjusted profits declined 18%. That said, Alibaba shares are priced for this terrible environment to continue forever, and many of the exogenous issues should eventually abate. Signs suggest the regulatory pressure is already easing. The government has been stepping in with economic stimulus. The zero-COVID policy must eventually end. In addition, Alibaba’s management has taken important steps to improve profitability by reducing investments in loss-making new business ventures. When the environment improves, we believe that Alibaba’s core business franchises will return to growth, and profits will follow. The disconnect between Alibaba’s price and value continues to be one of the biggest we have seen in our careers.”13. SoftBank Group CorpMarket Capitalization as of October 28: $63.7 billion  Amount Raised at IPO: $23.5 billionJapan’s SoftBank Corp started trading publicly in December 2018, and it was one of the largest IPOs the world had seen. SoftBank Corp is the telecoms division of Japanese billionaire CEO Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group. SoftBank Corp raised 2.65 trillion yen, or $23.5 billion, after pricing the IPO units at 1,500 yen per share. The market capitalization as of October 28 stood at nearly $64 billion. 12. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $430.523 billion  Amount Raised at IPO: $17.9 billionVisa Inc. (NYSE:V), the American multinational payments technology firm, had its IPO in March 2008. The company raised $17.9 billion as investors jumped on its growth potential coming out of the US mortgage crisis. Visa sold 406 million class A common stock for $44 per share, above the forecast $37-$42. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is partnering with blockchain firms to offer crypto debit cards, a new offering in addition to its card products, payment platforms, and value-added services.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We reinitiated a small position in Visa, which we had previously owned for years (selling out of the position at higher levels in February). We continue to believe that the long-term secular growth trend towards digital payments remains intact and has been further enhanced by the COVID crisis. The growth in debit cards, contactless payments, e-commerce, and now, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), are all driving digital payment penetration, and we continue to be impressed with the long-term growth potential of V (and our other payment holdings Mastercard, Adyen, and PayPal).”11. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $73.223 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $3.5 billionAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), the California-based travel technology firm, had a massive initial public offering in 2020. The company opened at $146 per share on the NASDAQ, far ahead of the IPO price of $68 per share. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) amassed a market cap of about $86.5 billion, more than double the IPO valuation it sought a day earlier. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is one of the best IPO stocks of all time. Here is what Polen Capital specifically said about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) was one of our largest detractors from performance in the second quarter. Airbnb is the clear market leader in private rental bookings globally, according to market research firm Euromonitor. The business is currently firing on all cylinders, with revenue and earnings growth well above our expectations and long-term estimates. It would be easy to say that it is because as the world reopens, people are traveling for the first time in two years, providing a short-term benefit to the company. But, Airbnb also grew quickly in 2021 when people were still hesitant to travel and preferred staying close to home. The company’s growth in 2022 is not an easy comparison like it is for online travel agencies (which are more hotel-oriented), airlines, and hotels. In fact, Airbnb’s business has outpaced the hotel industry growth by more than 1,250 basis points per year since 2019, showing far more resilience than hotels and online travel agencies.Airbnb didn’t invent the private rental market, but it developed a better offering and helped it scale with robust network effects and a system of trust protecting travelers and hosts alike. It has diligently removed friction from the marketplace to catalyze demand.The business model has very high incremental profit margins. When the company went public only a year and a half ago, it had pretax profit margins on a non-GAAP basis of approximately 5% by our calculations. This year, those margins should approach 30%. In addition, the company has generated approximately $3 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. The runway for growth in private rental is very long, especially considering that hybrid work will likely remain for the long-term, allowing for more business/leisure trips that work better in Airbnbs than hotels, in our view…” (Click here to read full text)10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $266.215 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $16 billionMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) debuted on the NASDAQ on May 18, 2012. The initial public offering of 421.23 million shares was priced at $38 each, and the trade opened at $42.05 per share, a gain of approximately 11%. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was thus worth over $100 billion and managed to raise $16 billion by selling its initial shares. It was one of the largest tech IPOs in the world. Meta is valued at more than $266 billion as of October 28, and it is one of the biggest companies in the world by market cap. Here is what Giverny Capital specifically said about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Our worst performers for the year-to-date have been painful. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is down roughly 60%, and Carmax, Eurofins Scientific, Coherent and Ciena have lost about half their value. I’m wearing a dunce cap for Meta, as the changes Apple made to privacy tracking severely impacted Meta’s effectiveness at targeting ads to the right consumers. However, despite being compared recently to AOL by one analyst, Meta continues to capture enormous amounts of consumer attention: roughly 2.9 billion people use one of its sites every day. I believe it has a very long runway on monetizing those eyeballs, especially outside North America. For all its problems with ad tracking, and despite heavy investment in the so called metaverse, Meta should earn about $10 per share in 2022 and more next year. The stock, at $136 on September 30, reflects pessimism that Meta will ever recover. We’re holding because we think that Meta has the resources to improve its advertising efficiency, and that it eventually will.”9. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $56.55 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $15.77 billionGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM), the American automaker manufacturing trucks, crossovers, and electric cars, had one of the largest IPOs of all time in November 2010. The company sold 478 million common shares priced at $33 each, raising $15.77 billion, as well as $4.35 billion in preferred stock, higher than the initially planned $4 billion. As of October 28, 2022, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has a market cap of more than $56.5 billion. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital specifically said about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Auto manufacturer General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) was also among our bottom contributors in Q2. Rising interest rates and continued supply chain issues have increased uncertainty surrounding the auto industry, exerting downward pressure on stocks of auto makers. We continue to like GM’s focus on its most profitable market segments (SUV, crossovers, trucks) and believe the company’s heavy investments in autonomous capabilities will position it favorably as the secular movement towards autonomous vehicles continues.”8. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $30.477 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $12 billion Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and related accessories. The IPO was priced at $78 a share, valuing Rivian at $66.5 billion. The Amazon-backed electric vehicle maker had a market valuation exceeding $100 billion a day after its IPO on November 9, 2021. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) was one of the largest IPOs of 2021. Here is what Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund has to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Rivian Automotive, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells consumer and commercial electric vehicles. Shares of Rivian declined 48.2% in the second quarter as investors continued rotating out of long-duration assets and have become increasingly concerned about capital intensity and cash burn.At the same time, Rivian continues to be impacted by supply chain issues which are causing delays in its production ramp. Rivian is addressing those challenges by diversifying its supply chain to alleviate shortages while also consolidating the number of variants in development to reduce cash burn (the company guided that current cash will be enough to support the company’s future platform launch ‘R2’ in 2025). Rivian recently reported stronger-than-expected second quarter production numbers while reiterating its annual guidance of producing 25,000 units.As semiconductor shortages ease, we believe that the company will be able to rapidly ramp its production. We retain conviction in the shares given management’s vision, Rivian’s product positioning, the company’s relationship with Amazon.com, and its strong balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, Rivian had $17 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which will help it overcome the current challenges while taking advantage of the long-term opportunity as the market transitions to electric vehicles.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $54.576 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $8.1 billionUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), the American firm providing technology-led ride sharing services, features as one of the largest IPOs of all time worldwide. Uber listed publicly on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10, 2019, with an IPO price of $45 per share. Bankers floated a valuation of about $120 billion for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), however, the mobility firm did not touch that figure. As of October 28, 2022, Uber is valued at nearly $55 billion. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Uber was our top contributor for the quarter on better-than-expected 2Q results, and 3Q EBITDA guidance that was well ahead of Street estimates. The company reported 33% Gross Bookings growth from both the continued recovery of Mobility Gross Bookings, up 55% year over year, and the continuation of Delivery Gross Bookings growth, up 7% year over year. Overall, revenue grew 105% year over year to $8 billion, generating $364 million of adjusted EBITDA, up $873 million year over year. Management guided to 25%-30% gross bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA of $440-$470 million for 3Q. Significantly, FCF was positive at $382 million, up $780 million year over year, and remains on track to be positive for the year allowing the company to self-fund future growth.UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the expectation of substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its more than 120 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as grocery delivery, truck brokerage (the company had $1.8 billion in Freight revenue for 2Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $10 billion of cash and investments against $9 billion of debt, the company today has an enterprise value of $57 billion indicating that UBER trades at only 1.5x next year’s estimated revenue.”6. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $144.634 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $5.5 billionUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is an American company that provides letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services. On November 10, 1999, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) offered 109,400,000 shares on the NYSE. The IPO stock price was $50 per share. The stock closed its first day with a 35% gain. It was one of the largest IPOs of all time worldwide. The current market cap, as of October 28, stands at nearly $145 billion. Although IPO firms like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) failed to dazzle the market, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is one of the most successful IPOs of all time. Here is what ClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG Strategy has to say about United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide.  Suggested articles:Most Educated Countries in the WorldBest Stocks For Beginners with Little MoneyBest Shipping and Container Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

293,988647ba-d206-3b69-b975-062479e235de,MAR,2022-11-01,Exclusive-Brazil coffee defaults spike for second year in a row,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-brazil-coffee-defaults-spike-112937190.html,1667302177,STORY,['KC=F'],"[By Maytaal Angel and Marcelo TeixeiraLONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brazilian coffee farmers are defaulting on contracts for a second straight year, according to traders and lawyers representing the industry, failing to deliver on pre-agreed sales and exposing trade houses to losses.The defaults, though less widespread than last year, have scrambled the coffee market, leaving traders reluctant to agree to forward sales for next year's crop or the one after.Defaults started to pick up last year after a series of price shocks caused by severe frosts that ruined the harvest.This year's harvest was smaller than expected. Some analysts cut their initial estimates by nearly 4 million bags as trees have taken longer to recover from 2021's frosts and drought. Coffee prices in August and September traded between $2.17 and $2.21 per pound, over 70% higher than two years ago.The surge in prices gave Brazilian farmers an opening to default on contracts so they could sell beans on the spot market, earning a higher price that outweighs any liability for a default.Several major exporters such as Sucafina, Olam, Louis Dreyfus and COFCO, as well as co-ops including No. 1 exporter Cooxupe, are legally battling farmers for compensation over contract defaults, according to court documents seen by Reuters.Sucafina, Olam, Dreyfus and COFCO did not respond to requests for comment. Cooxupe declined to comment.""We've been told to have less exposure with (Brazilian farmers). It's going to be one or two years until traders forget"" and start buying forward again, said a trader at a large international commodities trading company, asking not to be named.WIDER IMPACT OF DEFAULTSForward selling by farmers and exporters from top exporter Brazil is an important feature of the market. Advance sales help reduce market fluctuations because they allow farmers to sell throughout the year, not just during harvest.Lawyer Cristiano Zauli from Cristiano Zauli Advogados law firm, who assists traders in cases against Brazilian farmers, said he had filed around 50 lawsuits this year against about 100 last year, seeking compensation from coffee producers who have failed to deliver.Story continuesHe said he had obtained court orders to seize coffee at farms, similar to last year when harsh frosts damaged around 15% of Brazil's coffee crop and pushed prices to multi-year highs.Traders said this year's wave of defaults caused the ICE futures price to spike in late September ahead of the front month contract expiry, and could do so again ahead of the December contract expiry on Dec. 19.Traders who buy coffee a year or two in advance usually hedge purchases by taking short futures positions. When futures rise, they take a loss on that position, but can offset it with a similar rally in physical coffee prices.However, when farmers default, traders do not have the physical coffee to sell to offset the futures market. Instead, traders cover short positions by buying more futures, magnifying wild swings in the market.That's what happened in September, when Arabica coffee futures rose from around 2.16 cents per pound to 2.32 cents late in the month, a 7% increase.A lawyer working for one of the five largest coffee exporters in Brazil said the defaults concerned less than 10% of Brazil's total forward contracts. That would still be a significant amount since Brazil produces about 35% of the world's coffee.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Bernadette Baum)]"

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the ESG investing dynamics and challenges in the industry, you can go directly to read Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022. Over the past few years the concept of ESG has evolved dramatically. Environmental, Social, and Governance principles no longer belong to the vague realm of fancy words but rather play a key role in investing circles. Environmentally-conscious investors and activist hedge funds now pay serious attention to ESG metrics of companies before making investment decisions. Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.Regulatory pressure from governments around the world is also causing the companies to take ESG seriously. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However, as outlined in a whitepaper titled “ESG Portfolio Monitoring – A Best Practice for All Sides” in detail, this pressure is resulting in a backlash from several circles.  Many fund managers believe these ESG regulations sometimes tend to be too harsh, and can affect their ability to perform to ensure maximum returns for their clients.A Key Challenge in ESG InvestingIt’s also becoming increasingly difficult for average investors as well as fund managers and asset owners to assess ESG risks of companies they want to invest in. Apparently, ESG rating agencies solve this problem. They evaluate companies and provide ESG risk scores and ratings based on their analysis. However, these ratings could further confuse the investor. This is the problem highlighted in the whitepaper we referred to above, authored by Steve Glass, the co-CEO of Abel Noser Holdings, a New York-based firm that provides Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) and trade surveillance for investment managers and consultants.Story continuesThe whitepaper argues that because of the lack of standardization and benchmarking in the industry, each ESG ratings agency uses different data sources, methodologies and processes to assess a company. This results in huge variance and subjectivity in ESG scores.The whitepaper recommends using machine learning and AI to resolve this problem. The paper mentions an interesting example of OWL ESG, a California-based ESG analysis company that uses machine learning to process millions of data points from a plethora of sources to come up with consensus ESG ratings. These consensus ratings minimize divergence and discrepancies in ESG ratings.Photo by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used the latest datasets of Just Capital. Just Capital, a not-for-profit founded in 2013 by popular individuals like billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, Deepak Chopra, Rinaldo Brutoco, Arianna Huffington, Paul Scialla, Alan Fleischmann, among others, is striving to solve major problems related to environment, gender, racial justice and equality.Just Capital ranks the largest US companies based on their performance related to issues concerning environment, workers, customers, communities and shareholders.

(NASDAQ:PYPL)Payments giant PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced last year that it plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. The company also pledged to use renewable energy to power all its data centers by 2023. PayPal has 13 data centers and 22 points of presence (POPs). Currently, about 50% of the energy used to power its data centers comes from renewable sources. PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) is also eyeing to cut its operational greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2025.PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) is also exploring different horizons in the financial technology segment to solve the climate change problem. It funded the development of Digital Finance for Climate Resilience (DF4CR) Framework for Action which is working on developing climate resilience among financially underserved populations. The company also supports Catalyst Fund, which helps startups working to improve the livelihoods of underserved customers.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022.

(NASDAQ:PYPL)Payments giant PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced last year that it plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. The company also pledged to use renewable energy to power all its data centers by 2023. PayPal has 13 data centers and 22 points of presence (POPs). Currently, about 50% of the energy used to power its data centers comes from renewable sources. PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) is also eyeing to cut its operational greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2025.PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) is also exploring different horizons in the financial technology segment to solve the climate change problem. It funded the development of Digital Finance for Climate Resilience (DF4CR) Framework for Action which is working on developing climate resilience among financially underserved populations. The company also supports Catalyst Fund, which helps startups working to improve the livelihoods of underserved customers.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022.

If you want to see more of the biggest global tech companies by market cap, go directly to 5 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap.Over the last few decades, the tech sector has really grown. Internet penetration has increased, enterprises have gotten bigger, and far more people have computers and smartphones. As a result, the leading companies that offer internet or enterprise services or sell computers or smartphones have seen substantial increases in revenue. Companies that also make PC or smartphone semiconductors have also benefited enormously.In terms of the industry's growth, the number of internet users has increased from 16 million users of the internet at the end of 1995 to 5.473 billion internet users as of July 2022.The computing industry has grown from 59.7 million personal computers worldwide in 1995 to over 341 million globally in 2021.Meanwhile, in terms of smartphone growth, the industry has gone from its arguable invention in 2007 to 1.35 billion units in 2021.Given the amount of capital spent in terms of R&amp;D, technology will likely continue to advance in the future. Although some of future's leading technology companies may not have even been founded yet, some of today's leading tech companies have a good chance at being one of the leaders in tech in the future given their immense resources.Biggest Global Tech CompaniesIn terms of the largest tech companies worldwide today, the top 15 all have market caps of over $150 billion given how big some tech markets have become.In the last few decades, technology demand has also become more global as much of the smartphone or internet demand has come from outside the United States. As a result, many of today's leading tech companies are global in terms of their operations even if they are based in the United States. Several of the world's most valuable tech companies are based in Asia and one from Europe.Story continuesMany of the world's most valuable tech companies produce software, offer internet services, or help produce semiconductors which are essential for PCs and smartphones.In terms of the future, demand for semiconductors will likely increase and demand for internet and software will likely increase too. Given new competition and also lower prices for hardware, the leading tech companies will need to continue to innovate even if demand increases, however.With the continued development of AI and robotics, technology will continue to change our world. As the emerging markets continue to develop, the tech world will also likely be increasingly international.In terms of this year, 2022 has been challenging for many leading tech companies given the higher inflation and rising interest rates. With many expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further this year, economic growth could slow both in the United States and internationally in the near future.If a recession occurs, leading tech companies could face more headwinds. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the technology sector as a whole in the long run, there's likely more growth even if there's a recession in 2023.Photo by Roberto Júnior on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap, we took the top 15 largest companies by market capitalization from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest tech companies by market cap list.For our data, we used companiesmarketcap.com's data for market capitalization and we used the number of hedge funds in our database of 895 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022 for number of hedge fund holders.15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap15.

307,426ef394-3df8-3094-a514-a66529ebade8,MCK,2022-11-01,"MedTech Stocks Due to Report Earnings on Nov 1: MCK, CTLT & More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtech-stocks-due-report-earnings-153503617.html,1667230503,STORY,"['MCK', 'ABMD', 'HSIC', 'ECL', 'CTLT', 'IDXX']","[The third-quarter reporting cycle has just begun for the Medical sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Quarterly performances have been discouraging so far. Per the latest trends, the Medical sector is one of the spaces witnessing negative estimate revisions among seven other sectors since mid-April.The latest Earnings Preview indicates that 23.2% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting nearly 43% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings until Oct 26. Earnings decreased 1.8% year over year despite 7.5% higher revenues. A total of 76.9% of the companies’ earnings as well as revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The scorecard so far reflects unstable market conditions within the United States as the majority of the players in the Medical sector have been reeling under an uncertain macroeconomic environment for a while. Though the majority of the players in the Medical sector have been holding their ground on the back of strong consumer demand, their operations in challenging market conditions are taking a toll on their quarterly performances. The current supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressure are expected to linger at least for the next few months, thereby putting pressure on the Medical sector’s overall performance. Overall, third-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 8.3% despite a 3.8% sales increase. This compares with second-quarter earnings growth of 6.5% on 9.9% reported revenue growth.MedTech Quarterly SynopsisThe MedTech companies’ collective business growth is likely to have deteriorated from the comparable prior-year period’s performance. This year, COVID-led fatality across the United States and other developed countries has declined significantly thus far. Additionally, notable MedTech players have been making consistent efforts to mitigate staffing shortages that have disrupted business growth. However, continued supply chain-induced constraints, inflationary pressure and an overall unstable macroeconomic business environment are likely to have dampened the overall recovery of the MedTech players following the prior-year’s pandemic-induced challenges.Story continuesAlthough the countries have been lifting COVID-19 restrictions over the past few months (barring a few regions), the continuous reopening of economies might still not have been sufficient to boost the growth process in the September quarter amid a tough business climate. These factors are likely to have significantly weighed on the performances of several businesses of the MedTech sector during the third quarter.Overall, the strength in the product portfolios and solid customer adoption of the products through the July-September months are expected to have been impressive. MedTech companies like McKesson Corporation MCK, Catalent, Inc. CTLT, Ecolab Inc. ECL, Abiomed, Inc. ABMD, Henry Schein, Inc. HSIC and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX are likely to have been positively impacted by the tailwinds discussed above, despite encountering turbulences on the macroeconomic front.Let’s observe the status of six MedTech players, scheduled to announce results on Nov 1.McKesson: McKesson’s U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment is likely to have benefited from market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers in second-quarter fiscal 2023.

However, Ecolab confirmed on its second-quarter earnings call in July that the dine-in traffic in U.S. restaurants was still down. Although the traffic has considerably recovered, it is likely to have been suppressed in the third quarter as well. This is expected to have partially weighed on the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.

The dental business is likely to have seen robust sales contributions from dental specialty products, specifically within the oral surgery category. Henry Schein, in July 2022, acquired Condor Dental, which is expected to extend its foray into the Swiss market for its dental distribution business.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because McKesson is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MCK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $6.15 per share for MCK, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.13 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MCK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.27% heading into earnings season.McKesson Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation price-eps-surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that MCK has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

310,26f6931c-7a8d-33f7-aeb7-375a2d46e784,TRV,2022-11-01,"Institutional investors have a lot riding on The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) with 84% ownership",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-travelers-144212216.html,1667227332,STORY,['TRV'],"[Every investor in The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 3.3% last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 16% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Travelers Companies, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Travelers Companies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Travelers Companies?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Travelers Companies. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Travelers Companies, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Travelers Companies. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.7% and 8.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Travelers CompaniesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Travelers Companies, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$147m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Travelers Companies. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Travelers Companies has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

These results demonstrate the continued strength of our established businesses along with the momentum across our digital portfolio. It is a strong start to what promises to be a notable fiscal year of prominent scheduled events across the company underscoring the importance of our live and event programming to viewers.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders and EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company's historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to management, investors and equity analysts to assist in their analysis of the Company's performance relative to prior periods and the Company's competitors.The following table reconciles net income and EPS attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2022September 30, 2021IncomeEPSIncomeEPS$ Millions, except per share dataNet income$613$708Less: Net income attributable to    noncontrolling interests(8)(7)Net income attributable to Fox    Corporation stockholders$605$1.10$701$1.21Other, net5770.14(68)(0.12)Tax provision(12)(0.02)90.02Rounding-(0.01)--As adjusted$670$1.21$642$1.11 NOTE 2 – ADJUSTED EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense.Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.The following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:Three Months EndedSeptember 30,20222021$ MillionsNet Income$613$708Add:Amortization of cable distribution investments45Depreciation and amortization9979Interest expense, net6897Other, net76(69)Income tax expense232244Adjusted EBITDA$1,092$1,0641Excludes net income effects of Impairment and restructuring charges, adjustments to Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, Other, net and tax provision adjustments.

A stunning comeback-- Brazil's former President leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, he beat conservative incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in what was the country's closest presidential race in history. The outcome of the election signals a shift back to the left for Brazil. And it's a wild comeback for the man who was in jail for corruption just three years ago. Lula defeated Bolsonaro with 50.9% to 49.1% of the votes in Sunday's runoff. That's according to the official tally. And also, we are watching Brazil-related shares, including of those of Petrobras. That's the Brazilian state-run oil company. They are lower today on the perception that Lula might not be so favorable to the industry.And the Big 12 has reached a six year contract extension with ESPN and Fox worth more than $2 billion. This will keep the conference's media rights with those networks through the 2030-31 college sports season. That's according to multiple reports. The conference's new media rights deal comes only a few months after the hire of new commissioner, Brett Yormark. Yormark and conference leadership lobbied to open up the Big 12's negotiating rights window with networks early in order to reach a new deal and bring stability to the league, despite the impending departures of Texas and Oklahoma to the SEC in 2025.And the Powerball jackpot. Brad left to go get his tickets. Just getting larger. The drawing for tonight hit $1 billion. That was after no winning tickets were sold for Saturday's drawing. It's the second biggest jackpot in US history. The cash value is estimated at $497 million. The largest pot ever was just over $1 and 1/2 billion. If you remember, that was won on January 13, 2016. But [INAUDIBLE] you may not want to rush out. Your odds of winning-- one in 292 million.- Julie, I'm still trying to figure out how to spend the $1.5 billion I won. Julie, thank you so much.]"

ALB, Chevron Corp. CVX, Jazz Pharmaceuticals JAZZ and Cummins Inc. CMI.4 High Earnings Yield Picks That You Shouldn't IgnoreInvestors often use the P/E ratio and other valuation metrics to pick undervalued stocks with solid upside potential. One can also use another interesting ratio. Earnings yield, expressed in percentage, is calculated as (Annual Earnings per Share/Market Price) x 100.While comparing stocks, if other factors are similar, investors can look out for stocks with higher earnings yield. This is because stocks with higher earnings yield have the potential of providing comparatively greater returns. Albemarle Corp., Chevron Corp., Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Cummins Inc. are some stocks boasting high earnings yield.Just like the case with dividend yield, firms with higher earnings yield are considered underpriced, while those with lower earnings yield are seen as overpriced. Earnings yield captures both the tangible and intangible yield of a firm, as opposed to dividend yield, which only takes into account the tangible yield.Importantly, earnings yield can also be used to compare the performance of a market index with the 10-year Treasury yield. For instance, when the yield of the market index is more than the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be considered as undervalued than bonds. In this situation, investing in the stock market would be a better option for a value investor.Earnings Yield: Simply the Inverse of P/EEarnings yield is nothing but the reciprocal of one of the most popular valuation metrics, i.e., the P/E ratio (stock price/earnings per share). In fact, as the concept of earnings yield is already indirectly captured in the P/E ratio, earnings yield as an investment valuation metric is not as widely used as the P/E ratio.Having said that, it should be noted that earnings yield is an important tool for investors with exposure to both stocks and bonds. In fact, with regard to this, earnings yield can be more illuminating than the traditional P/E ratio, as the former facilitates the comparison of stocks with fixed-income securities.Story continuesHere we discuss four of the 131 stocks that qualified the screen:Albemarle: Charlotte-based Albemarle is a premier specialty chemicals company with leading positions in attractive end markets globally.Albemarle remains focused on strengthening its lithium business and is taking actions to grow its key businesses.

The government claimed the deal would have curbed competition in the market for rights to top-selling books, lowering writers' pay and reducing consumers' choices. The publishers countered by contending the deal would have let them compete with digital giants Amazon (AMZN) and Disney (DIS).U.S. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department's antitrust division described the decision as a victory for authors, readers and ideas, as well as for workers more broadly.“The proposed merger would have reduced competition, decreased author compensation, diminished the breadth, depth, and diversity of our stories and ideas, and ultimately impoverished our democracy,"" Kanter said.Penguin Random House did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. For Simon &amp; Schuster, Paramount Global said, “Paramount is disappointed by the ruling in this case. We are reviewing the decision and discussing next steps with Bertelsmann and Penguin Random House, including seeking an expedited appeal.”Penguin Random House, one of a group of large publishers known as the “Big Five,” is the world’s largest English-language trade publisher. Simon &amp; Schuster ranks as the fourth largest book publisher in the U.S.Story continuesThe DOJ alleged that eliminating the companies’ head-to-head competition to acquire manuscripts through higher author advances lower advances and in turn decreases the number and variety of books available to consumers. Plus, they said, more large publishing firms are needed because smaller firms lack the services of large firms and can’t take on risks that come with hefty advances.Penguin books are seen in a used bookshop in central London October 29, 2012. Britain's Pearson has agreed to merge its Penguin book division with Bertelsmann's Random House to create the world's leading consumer publisher, in an apparent snub to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth (BRITAIN - Tags: ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA BUSINESS EDUCATION)“[T]he proposed transaction would eliminate competition between two of the last remaining major publishers,” the government's complaint states.Penguin Random House said the government failed to meet its fundamental burden to identify a relevant market. A market for “anticipated top-selling books” exceeding $250,000 in advance fees doesn’t exist, its lawyers told the judge. In addition, the government failed to show a harm that justifies scuttling the deal, they said.The judge issued a separate memorandum Monday with more detailed reasoning under seal because it contains confidential information.

Foxconn on Tuesday announced it would quadruple daily bonuses for some of the plant's workers to 400 yuan ($55) should they continue to work there through November.Zhengzhou unexpectedly lifted its quasi-lockdown on its nearly 13 million people, even as new locally transmitted cases more than doubled on Monday from the day before.""For over 10 days, we have persevered and fought together ... finally we are ushering in a large-scale restoration of normal life and production in Zhengzhou,"" the city's counter-epidemic task force told residents.The outbreak in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, flared up after the Oct. 1-7 National Day holidays, prompting local authorities to start imposing the lockdown of various districts.

The government argued the deal should be stopped because it would lead to less competition for blockbuster books and lower advances for authors who earn $250,000 or more.Penguin Random House said the decision was ""unfortunate,"" and said it would ""immediately request an expedited appeal.""""A merger would be good for competition,"" said Thomas Rabe, chief executive of Penguin owner Bertelsmann, who said the court's decision was based on incorrect basic assumptions.Penguin writers include cookbook author Ina Garten and novelists Zadie Smith and Danielle Steele, while Simon &amp; Schuster publishes Stephen King, Jennifer Weiner and Hillary Rodham Clinton, among others.Penguin is owned by Bertelsmann, a German media group, while Paramount Global owns Simon &amp; Schuster.""The proposed merger would have reduced competition, decreased author compensation, diminished the breadth, depth, and diversity of our stories and ideas, and ultimately impoverished our democracy,"" U.S. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said in a statement.The U.S. Justice Department had filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal in November 2021.In hearings held in August, the government argued that the largest five publishers control 90% of the market, and a combined Penguin and Simon &amp; Schuster would control nearly half of the market for publishing rights to blockbuster books while its nearest competitors would be less than half its size.Story continuesPenguin Random House lawyer Daniel Petrocelli, who defeated the government in a previous merger challenge, argued during the trial that the deal would have ""enormous benefits"" for readers and authors alike because the imprints, or brands, owned by the two giants would continue to compete against each other.Best-selling author Stephen King, who testified during the three-week trial, took issue with this pledge. ""You might as well say you're going to have a husband and wife bidding against each other for the same house. It's kind of ridiculous,"" King told the court.The top five publishers are Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette, with Walt Disney Co and Amazon.com Inc also in the market. HarperCollins is owned by News Corp.Pan was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by President Joe Biden, who then nominated her to the appeals court in Washington.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are just a handful of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, which we’ll examine in this article.The NASDAQ index isn’t typically known for its high-dividend paying stocks. In fact, some of the most prominent companies that make up the index, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), fail to pay any dividend at all.The NASDAQ 100 index’s dividend yield stands at just a hair above 1%, which is rather paltry when compared to the companies that make up the Dow Jones index, which yields more than twice that at 2.27%. The average dividend yield of the companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index also stands at a far more robust 1.8%.Those figures aren’t totally surprising given the makeup of many of the companies on those indexes. While the Dow and S&amp;P are known for boasting many mature companies that have stable cash flows that make them safe dividend stock picks, the same can’t be said of the NASDAQ, which features many young tech companies that are still in their high-growth stages.Those dynamics are also apparent in the performance of those indexes this year. While the Dow shot up by 800 points on October 28 and has registered four straight weeks of gains, the NASDAQ has continued to flounder for the most part, down 30% year-to-date, though it has gained 7% in the last two weeks. With investors being bearish and looking to the defensive side of the market to get them through the current economic environment, high-growth tech companies that lose money are rarely on the menu.Some of the best dividend stocks on the market can be found in the NASDAQ however, with yields that top 2% and steady income streams to support not only their current dividend payouts, but continued dividend growth as well. Notably, many of them are not traditional NASDAQ tech stocks, though several prominent tech heavyweights also feature on the list.Story continuesWe’ll take a look at all of those top dividend stocks in this article, which feature yields above 2%. We’ll also look into their cash flow situation, dividend history, and more, to get a sense of how suitable an investment they are.15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Our MethodologyThe following NASDAQ dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy15. NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 Dividend Yield: 2.8% Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) are some of the best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy, a label which also applies to Chinese video game giant NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES). The company, which develops and publishes PC MMORPGs and mobile games, including Diablo Immortal in China, has a variable dividend policy based on the previous quarter’s earnings. NetEase’s most recent quarterly dividend grew by 12% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the company’s five year dividend growth rate of 12.1%.NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has been facing some headwinds in China, most notably from the Chinese government, which didn’t approve any of its games for release for over a year as it seeks to crack down on videogame addiction in the country. NetEase was finally issued a license for a new game in September, but more importantly, Diablo Immortal was also released in Q3 after a slight delay, which should help offset any slowdown in its other titles.Hedge fund ownership of NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) has slumped heavily over the last year, falling by 41% during that time to hit a four-year low. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates were some of the biggest money managers to sell off their NTES positions during Q2. William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management held the largest stake among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey on June 30, owning 3.67 million shares.14. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 Dividend Yield: 2.02% Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) raised its dividend by 6.7% in Q4, which also pushed it 33% higher than Q2 of 2021. That’s been a positive development for the company’s dividend investors, which had been saddled with a flat dividend for ten straight quarters prior to Q3 2021. KDP shares currently yield just over 2% and the dividend is well supported, with the company’s payout ratio being less than 50%.Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) deliver adjusted EPS of $0.46 in Q3 alongside revenue of $3.62 billion, results that were in line with expectations. The company also reaffirmed its FY22 revenue and EPS guidance, which called for low-double-digit growth in the former and mid-single-digit growth in the latter. With the company seemingly overcoming the supply chain challenges that hampered its coffee business earlier this year, it expects strong sales and earnings growth from the business in Q4.Hedge fund ownership of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) spiked during the third quarter of 2020 but immediately fell back to baseline during the following quarter, where it’s remained since. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors opened a 1.89 million shares position in KDP during Q2, while Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management raised its stake in the company by 150% during the quarter to 1.63 million shares.13. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 30 Dividend Yield: 3.71% American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) is growing its dividend by 6.4% in Q4, pushing its yield to 3.71%. The company has grown its dividend for 12 straight years and has a very manageable payout ratio of 62%. AEP is transitioning to cleaner energy systems that the company believes will support long-term earnings growth. Its Q3 operating EPS was $1.62, beating estimates by $0.06, while its $5.5 billion in revenue topped estimates by a hearty $750 million.Hedge fund ownership of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) has dipped for three straight quarters, dropping by 21% during that time. Joel Greenblatt’s Gotham Asset Management and Peter Muller’s PDT Partners were among the funds to sell out of their AEP positions during Q2. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies held the largest position on June 30 at 1.03 million shares.ClearBridge Investments owns 780,980 shares of AEP as of June 30 and likes American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP)’s aggressive renewables ramp, adding the stock to its portfolio during Q1 and discussing it in the ClearBridge Investments Value Equity Q1 2022 investor letter:“About 5% of the portfolio is in transitioning power companies, typically migrating from coal to renewables. We have been active in encouraging these transitions and added a new position in American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP). AEP has the fastest planned renewable energy ramp in the U.S., with plans to both shrink coal and grow renewables by 50% each by 2030. This would drive an 80% emissions reduction, while supporting high single-digit earnings growth at a double-digit return.”12. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 32 Dividend Yield: 3.48% Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)’s dividend was cut by 11.1% this year and has largely stagnated for several years, with it currently paying out less than it was in 2018. With a solid yield and payout ratio under 50%, it’s still a dividend worth considering, especially given that it should benefit from the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act. BMO Capital analyst James Thalacker has an ‘Outperform” rating on EXC shares and believes the company is well positioned to achieve multiple expansion.There was a big sell off of Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) by hedge funds during the first quarter of this year, as there was a 31% drop in ownership of the stock. Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp and Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management were among the funds to unload their EXC positions during Q1. Ownership of the stock remained flat during Q2.ClearBridge Investments, which owns 1.62 million EXC shares as of June 30, believes Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is starting to be viewed as a premium utility, as revealed in the ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Value Strategy’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. electric utility Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) was also a top contributor. Exelon is a pure transmission and distribution regulated utility business serving millions of electric and gas customers across Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Shares outperformed along with the utilities sector; Exelon is also starting to be viewed as a premium name after its recently completed spin-off of power generation business Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG).”11. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 33 Dividend Yield: 2.55% Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) grew its dividend by 10.7% this year, marking its 24th straight year of dividend growth and positioning the company to join the select group of Dividend Aristocrats next year. The company has grown its dividend at a strong CAGR of 14.1% over the past five years, which has pushed the stock’s yield above 2.5%. The company’s payout ratio is just under 65%.Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) reported Q3 revenue and EPS of $1.8 billion and $0.50 respectively, which were largely in line with estimates, though topping them slightly. Net sales were up by 16% year-over-year during Q3, including 21.4% year-over-year growth in August. Argus analyst John Eade has a ‘Buy’ rating on FAST shares and believes the company can generate high-single-digit EPS growth over the long-term, which should support continued dividend growth.There was a 17% jump in hedge fund ownership of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) during Q2. Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management built a large stake in the company of 1.14 million shares during Q2, while Israel Englander’s Millennium Management hiked its position by 1,174% to 973,277 shares.10. Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 37 Dividend Yield: 2.64% Payroll and HR services provider Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has been steadily growing its earnings for the last decade and the company is starting to get more aggressive with its dividend as a result, raising it by 19.7% in the second quarter of this year. PAYX shares now yield a solid 2.64%, though the company’s payout ratio is slightly high at just under 75%.Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has grown its earnings at close to an 11% clip on an annualized basis over the past five years and the company expects more of the same in FY23, predicting 11% to 12% earnings growth, so it should have no problem continuing to grow its dividend as it’s done for the past seven years. The company’s Q1 FY23 EPS was $1.03, beating estimates by $0.06.There’s been a 37% jump in the number of smart money managers long Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) during the past five quarters, as hedge funds become increasingly intrigued by the company’s growing customer base. Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group owns 2.14 million PAYX shares as of June 30, the largest stake in the company among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey.9. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 2.82% Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) grew its dividend by 10.7% in the third quarter of this year, which represented slowing growth compared to its dividend’s 15.5% CAGR over the past five years. With a payout ratio of just over 20%, Skyworks should have no trouble maintaining double digit dividend growth in the years to come.The radiofrequency device manufacturer is expanding its offerings across multiple markets in the wake of the possibility that it will lose its biggest customer Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the years to come. Its revenue from non-mobile phone products grew by 38% year-over-year in Q2 to account for 38% of the company’s revenue, so it’s on the right track.Hedge fund ownership of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) was flat during the second quarter but is down by 24% since the third quarter of 2020 as hedge funds increasingly shy away from semiconductor stocks during the current cycle. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management also unloaded her SWKS stake during Q3.Heartland Advisors, which owns 119,628 shares of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) as of June 30, discussed how cheap the stock has become in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”8. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Dividend Yield: 5.25% Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is a Dividend Aristocrat, pushing towards 30 consecutive years of dividend growth. Its dividend inched up to $0.48 in Q3 and has grown at less than a 5% CAGR over the past five years, but with a yield that’s already above 5%, its shares should nonetheless be attractive to dividend investors. While Walgreens’ payout ratio is under 40%, its profit margins are also slim, which could cause issues if its expansion into the primary care field doesn’t pan out.Hedge fund ownership of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) trended down heavily between 2015 and 2019, falling by more than half during that time, and was remained relatively flat since. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management owns 2.83 million WBA shares as of June 30, having 4.64% 13F exposure to the stock.Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity, which sold out of its Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2, discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”7. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Dividend Yield: 4.11% The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) slashed its dividend by 36% in 2019 and it’s been flat ever since, so investors shouldn’t count on it growing any time soon, especially with the company’s margins being heavily pressured in Q2. Still, with a yield above 4% thanks to KHC shares cratering over the past five years, it may be an opportune time to for investors to add a good defensive dividend stock to their portfolios.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) surged its prices by 12.4% in Q2 but margins still fell by more than four percentage points year-over-year to just over 30% and sales volumes fell by over 2%. The company’s revenue and adjusted net income did beat estimates in Q3, coming in at $6.5 billion and $0.63 per share respectively, but year-over-year sales volumes fell again, this time by nearly 4%.Hedge fund ownership of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) ticked up by 19% during the second quarter as hedge funds began taking a harder look at quality food producers in an investing environment turning more defensive. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintains the largest stake in KHC as of June 30, owning nearly 326 million shares worth $12.4 billion.6. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 Dividend Yield: 2.18% Closing out the first part of the list is eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), which has already grown its dividend payments by 57% since first instituting them in the second quarter of 2019. The e-commerce platform made its most aggressive dividend hike yet in the first quarter of this year, raising its dividend by 22%. With a yield now topping 2% and a payout ratio of just 20%, eBay is becoming a compelling dividend stock for investors to consider.While the number of active buyers on eBay’s platform fell by 12% year-over-year in Q2, the company’s strong profit margins should ensure continued earnings power for years to come, especially with eBay’s take rate growing by 130 basis points to 12.4%. There’s plenty of room for further growth in that regard, as rival Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)’s take rate is nearly 20%.Hedge fund ownership of eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) dropped by 20% during the first half of 2022 and is less than half what it was eight years ago. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners both sold out of their EBAY stakes during the second quarter.Smead Capital Management, which owns 2.97 million eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) shares as of June 30, discussed the stock’s poor run in Smead Value Fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”Gilead Sciences, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the ESG investing dynamics and challenges in the industry, you can go directly to read Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022. Over the past few years the concept of ESG has evolved dramatically. Environmental, Social, and Governance principles no longer belong to the vague realm of fancy words but rather play a key role in investing circles. Environmentally-conscious investors and activist hedge funds now pay serious attention to ESG metrics of companies before making investment decisions. Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.Regulatory pressure from governments around the world is also causing the companies to take ESG seriously. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However, as outlined in a whitepaper titled “ESG Portfolio Monitoring – A Best Practice for All Sides” in detail, this pressure is resulting in a backlash from several circles.  Many fund managers believe these ESG regulations sometimes tend to be too harsh, and can affect their ability to perform to ensure maximum returns for their clients.A Key Challenge in ESG InvestingIt’s also becoming increasingly difficult for average investors as well as fund managers and asset owners to assess ESG risks of companies they want to invest in. Apparently, ESG rating agencies solve this problem. They evaluate companies and provide ESG risk scores and ratings based on their analysis. However, these ratings could further confuse the investor. This is the problem highlighted in the whitepaper we referred to above, authored by Steve Glass, the co-CEO of Abel Noser Holdings, a New York-based firm that provides Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) and trade surveillance for investment managers and consultants.Story continuesThe whitepaper argues that because of the lack of standardization and benchmarking in the industry, each ESG ratings agency uses different data sources, methodologies and processes to assess a company. This results in huge variance and subjectivity in ESG scores.The whitepaper recommends using machine learning and AI to resolve this problem. The paper mentions an interesting example of OWL ESG, a California-based ESG analysis company that uses machine learning to process millions of data points from a plethora of sources to come up with consensus ESG ratings. These consensus ratings minimize divergence and discrepancies in ESG ratings.Photo by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used the latest datasets of Just Capital. Just Capital, a not-for-profit founded in 2013 by popular individuals like billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, Deepak Chopra, Rinaldo Brutoco, Arianna Huffington, Paul Scialla, Alan Fleischmann, among others, is striving to solve major problems related to environment, gender, racial justice and equality.Just Capital ranks the largest US companies based on their performance related to issues concerning environment, workers, customers, communities and shareholders. The company comprehensively surveys the American public based on its 241 individual ESG data points to reach its rankings.We focused more on the environmental aspect of the ESG matrix of these companies and talked about the projects and investments these companies have committed to in order to tackle the existential crisis of climate change.Top 12 ESG Companies in 202212. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is an Illinois-based utilities services company that owns nuclear, fossil, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, and solar generating facilities. According to its ESG report published in June last year, Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) claims to be the largest producer of zero-carbon electricity in the U.S.  In February this year, Exelon completed its split of power generation and competitive energy business.  Exelon’s power generation and retail energy business, now known as Constellation Energy Corp., started trading publicly on February 2. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)’s CFO Joseph Nigro thinks that the new, simplified structure will make the company more attractive for ESG investors.Investment firm UBS agreed with that notion in a report published after the split, saying: ""Exelon post-spin has a clean profile that fits into most ESG funds metrics, even if an exclusionary, already clean approach is used versus a rate of change approach.”11. PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP)PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in January last year announced that it plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 2040. PepsiCo, Inc.

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has announced plans to generate renewable energy equivalent to 50% of its annual electricity consumption by 2025. The telecom industry is one of the biggest polluters in the world. Verizon says it’s taking steps to lead from the front in solving this problem. The company claims that in 2021 alone, it recycled about 35.5 million pounds of e-waste, including 1.79 million pounds of plastic and 3.4 million pounds of lead-acid batteries. Earlier this year, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) struck 15 new deals related to renewable energy. Among the companies it signed these deals with include Duke Energy, Leeward Renewable Energy and Lightsource BP.8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)GPU company NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is fighting climate change in a unique, innovative way. The company says it’s building a digital version of our planet on which it’ll apply its AI and Omniverse technologies to predict weather changes and their effects over a span of several decades. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs will also be used to power the Department of Energy’s supercomputer called “Kestrel” which is dedicated to advanced energy solutions.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also striving to cut its carbon emissions. In 2014, the company started asking its manufacturing suppliers to report their greenhouse gas (GHQ) emissions. In its latest Corporate Sustainability report, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) said that its bulk carton packing operations use corrugated material that is 100% recycled fibers.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also partnered with Lockheed Martin AI Centre to solve the problem of wildfires. The companies plan to use machine learning and AI to decrease the response time to wildfires and make wildfire predictions.7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an ambitious goal to become carbon neutral by 2030 and the company is making significant progress towards this goal.

For example, Apple says switching to the Apple M1 chip in its 13-inch MacBook Pro reduced the product’s carbon footprint by 8%.6. PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Payments giant PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced last year that it plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. The company also pledged to use renewable energy to power all its data centers by 2023. PayPal has 13 data centers and 22 points of presence (POPs). Currently, about 50% of the energy used to power its data centers comes from renewable sources. PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) is also eyeing to cut its operational greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2025.PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) is also exploring different horizons in the financial technology segment to solve the climate change problem. It funded the development of Digital Finance for Climate Resilience (DF4CR) Framework for Action which is working on developing climate resilience among financially underserved populations. The company also supports Catalyst Fund, which helps startups working to improve the livelihoods of underserved customers.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for ONEOK, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$25b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, ONEOK has an ROCE of 13%.  In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Oil and Gas industry average of 17%, it's not as good. See our latest analysis for ONEOK roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for ONEOK compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for ONEOK.How Are Returns Trending?We like the trends that we're seeing from ONEOK. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 13%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 51%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.The Key TakeawayIn summary, it's great to see that ONEOK can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Since the stock has returned a solid 58% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesONEOK does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 2 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

OKE, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because ONEOK is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for OKE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 94 cents per share for OKE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for OKE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.62% heading into earnings season.ONEOK, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseONEOK, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseONEOK, Inc. price-eps-surprise | ONEOK, Inc.

QuoteFactors at PlayDXC’s fiscal second-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by the business operation closure in Russia following the Kremlin force’s invasion of Ukraine. On its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call, the company stated that the exit from Russia would reduce its total revenues by approximately $140 million in fiscal 2023.The strong U.S. dollar against major currencies and the concluded divestments of certain business units in the past 12 months are also anticipated to have negatively impacted the fiscal second-quarter top line. The company projected unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and divestitures to reduce fiscal second-quarter sales by $290 million and $93 million, respectively, and by $1 billion and $325 million in full-fiscal 2023.Apart from this, a weak traditional business is likely to have weighed on the to-be-reported quarter's performance. However, sequential revenue stabilization is expected to have continued.However, the negative impacts of the aforementioned factors are likely to have been partially offset by DXC’s strength in the digital business and partnerships, which have been helping it to expand in the cloud computing space. Increased IT spending is anticipated to have contributed to the top line in the quarter to be reported.Story continuesMoreover, margins are anticipated to have benefited from the company’s cost-saving initiatives and reduction in debts, which are likely to have lowered its interest expenses during the quarter. DXC projects the adjusted EBIT margin in the range of 7-7.5% in the fiscal second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for DXC this earnings season.

338,d7e1b941-bcaa-37e0-8a99-e096d2c985a3,HP,2022-11-01,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Helmerich & Payne (HP) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160004193.html,1667232004,STORY,['HP'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Helmerich &amp; Payne currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if HP is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this oil and gas well-drilling contractor holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For HP, shares are up 9.73% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry is up 9.73% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 33.3% compares favorably with the industry's 33.3% performance as well.Story continuesWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Helmerich &amp; Payne have risen 22.13%, and are up 58.76% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -3.86% and -13.78%, respectively.Investors should also take note of HP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, HP is averaging 988,075 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with HP.Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HP's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.02 to $0.00 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that HP is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Helmerich &amp; Payne on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Juniper Wireless Access Points and Juniper EX4400 Multigigabit Switches have been deployed in conjunction with the Juniper Mist Cloud and Mist AI™ to deliver predictable, reliable and measurable connectivity across the Walmart AMP.Heightened density and mobility requirements in entertainment venues like the Walmart AMP make it particularly challenging to deliver great Wi-Fi.

Walmart AMP employees use the network for staffing, inventory and other administrative tasks, while artists and the touring production companies run their jobs from the venue, so a reliable network is essential for tour management. Mist AI optimizes the Wi-Fi RF settings in real time, enabling artists and guests to experience seamless wireless connectivity throughout the venue. Juniper Mist Wi-Fi Assurance and Wired Assurance streamline network operations and speed troubleshooting.""As a nonprofit, we’ll never have an army of network engineers,"" said Jon Downey, Director of IT, Walmart AMP and Walton Arts Center.

(“Dentsply Sirona” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq: XRAY) today announced the completion of the previously disclosed internal investigation into certain financial reporting matters. The investigation was undertaken by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Dentsply Sirona Board of Directors (the “Audit and Finance Committee”). Its findings and the actions the Company is taking to address these findings and certain related financial reporting matters are discussed in a Current Report on Form 8-K (the “8-K”) filed by the Company today.“The Audit and Finance Committee’s thorough process conducted along with independent counsel and advisors resulted in findings and conclusions which have the full support of the Board,” said Eric Brandt, Chairman of the Dentsply Sirona Board of Directors. “The Company has already taken decisive and meaningful steps to address the findings and is now implementing enhancements and remedial measures to ensure these issues are thoroughly resolved. With a management team that is committed to accountability, operational rigor and integrity, coupled with the remedial measures, the entire Dentsply Sirona organization can move forward focused on delivering long-term growth and value creation.”Restatements of Third Quarter 2021 and Full Year 2021As noted in the 8-K filed today, on October 29, 2022, the Company, in consultation with the Audit and Finance Committee, reached a determination that the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, should no longer be relied upon because of certain misstatements contained in those financial statements. The Company has determined that it is appropriate to correct the misstatements in the Company’s previously issued financial statements by amending its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021 (the “Third Quarter 2021 Form 10-Q/A”), and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K/A”). The Audit and Finance Committee and management also discussed this conclusion with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.Story continuesControls and ProceduresIn connection with the restatement of the financial statements and related disclosures in the Third Quarter 2021 Form 10-Q/A and the 2021 Form 10-K/A, management re-evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures and identified one or more material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021. The material weaknesses remained in place as of December 31, 2021 and as of the date of the 8-K.The Company’s management has started to implement certain enhancements and remedial measures to its internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Management will continue to evaluate the processes, procedures and controls and will make any further changes as appropriate.Goodwill Impairment In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company expects to record a pre-tax non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the range of $1.0 billion - $1.3 billion, due primarily to macroeconomic factors such as higher cost of capital, cost inflation, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and increased supply chain costs, which are contributing to reduced forecasted revenues, lower operating margins, and reduced expectations for future cash flows.Select Preliminary Third Quarter 2022 Results and Fourth Quarter 2022 Revenue OutlookOn a preliminary basis, the Company expects that third quarter 2022 Net sales will be approximately $947 million (representing a slight decline in organic sales versus the prior year). Relative to the prior year period, these results reflect foreign exchange headwinds, global supply chain challenges, and softer volumes in the U.S. and China.Based on expected demand trends and foreign exchange impacts, the Company expects sequential Net sales to decline low-single digits in the fourth quarter 2022. On a constant currency basis, the Company expects sequential Net sales to be flat or up low-single digits in the fourth quarter 2022.The Company will provide further information about its results and 2022 outlook assumptions on its third quarter earnings conference call.The amounts set forth above are preliminary estimates. The Company is currently finalizing its results of operations for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. These preliminary estimates are based solely on information available to management as of the date of this press release. The Company’s actual results may differ from these estimates due to the completion of its quarter-end closing procedures, final adjustments and developments that may arise or information that may become available between now and the time the Company’s financial results are finalized and included in its Form 10-Q for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2022.The Company expects to announce its full third quarter 2022 financial results on or around November 9, 2022, and will host an earnings conference call to discuss these results at that time.About Dentsply Sirona Dentsply Sirona is the world’s largest manufacturer of professional dental products and technologies, with over a century of innovation and service to the dental industry and patients worldwide.

Net earned premiums are expected to have benefited from continued organic growth from strong U.S. sales in the Global Automotive business.

We can see that individual insiders own the lion's share in the company with 43% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Clearly, insiders benefitted the most after the company's market cap rose by US$14b last week.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Oracle, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Oracle ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Oracle?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Oracle does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Oracle's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthHedge funds don't have many shares in Oracle. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Lawrence Ellison (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 42% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 5.1% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 4.3% of the company stock.To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 3 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of OracleThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Oracle Corporation. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$90b stake in this US$210b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Oracle has   4 warning signs  (and 2 which make us uncomfortable)  we think you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to see more of the biggest global tech companies by market cap, go directly to 5 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap.Over the last few decades, the tech sector has really grown. Internet penetration has increased, enterprises have gotten bigger, and far more people have computers and smartphones. As a result, the leading companies that offer internet or enterprise services or sell computers or smartphones have seen substantial increases in revenue. Companies that also make PC or smartphone semiconductors have also benefited enormously.In terms of the industry's growth, the number of internet users has increased from 16 million users of the internet at the end of 1995 to 5.473 billion internet users as of July 2022.The computing industry has grown from 59.7 million personal computers worldwide in 1995 to over 341 million globally in 2021.Meanwhile, in terms of smartphone growth, the industry has gone from its arguable invention in 2007 to 1.35 billion units in 2021.Given the amount of capital spent in terms of R&amp;D, technology will likely continue to advance in the future. Although some of future's leading technology companies may not have even been founded yet, some of today's leading tech companies have a good chance at being one of the leaders in tech in the future given their immense resources.Biggest Global Tech CompaniesIn terms of the largest tech companies worldwide today, the top 15 all have market caps of over $150 billion given how big some tech markets have become.In the last few decades, technology demand has also become more global as much of the smartphone or internet demand has come from outside the United States. As a result, many of today's leading tech companies are global in terms of their operations even if they are based in the United States. Several of the world's most valuable tech companies are based in Asia and one from Europe.Story continuesMany of the world's most valuable tech companies produce software, offer internet services, or help produce semiconductors which are essential for PCs and smartphones.In terms of the future, demand for semiconductors will likely increase and demand for internet and software will likely increase too. Given new competition and also lower prices for hardware, the leading tech companies will need to continue to innovate even if demand increases, however.With the continued development of AI and robotics, technology will continue to change our world. As the emerging markets continue to develop, the tech world will also likely be increasingly international.In terms of this year, 2022 has been challenging for many leading tech companies given the higher inflation and rising interest rates. With many expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further this year, economic growth could slow both in the United States and internationally in the near future.If a recession occurs, leading tech companies could face more headwinds. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the technology sector as a whole in the long run, there's likely more growth even if there's a recession in 2023.Photo by Roberto Júnior on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap, we took the top 15 largest companies by market capitalization from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest tech companies by market cap list.For our data, we used companiesmarketcap.com's data for market capitalization and we used the number of hedge funds in our database of 895 funds that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q2 2022 for number of hedge fund holders.15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap15.

Such a scenario is upon us now, with investors increasingly turning to stable, boring stocks to fill out their portfolios as opposed to ones with greater long-term growth potential.What constitutes a boring stock is likely different for every investor, but some of the most common criteria include stocks that have a low beta, or volatility, which means they tend to avoid wild valuation swings. While that may be boring for day traders looking to profit from such swings with well-timed trades, investors looking to build a portfolio with an eye on steady long-term growth could do a lot worse than filling it with boring stocks.Low growth rates are another element of boring stocks that can make them unappealing to the masses. Barring some incredible fortune, there’s simply no means by which most boring stocks will ever compound at a significant rate over the long-term. Many of these companies have stable cash generating businesses, but their prospects for growth are minimal.Nonetheless, low volatility stocks frequently outperform their higher volatility brethren over the long-term, as they did between 1990 and 2011. Interestingly, the research that uncovered those results pointed to money managers as being one of the culprits. In their drive to beat market benchmarks, money managers frequently load up on riskier stocks that they hope will outperform, driving up their valuations. Likewise, the avoidance of low-growth, boring companies by those same money managers somewhat suppresses their own valuations.Story continuesIn the following list, we’ll take a look at ten boring stocks, all of which have generated at least $100 million in trailing twelve month net income, and many of which have generated billions. We’ll analyze why these stocks are boring, but why that also makes them intriguing long-term investments.10 Boring Stocks That Make Money 360b/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe following boring, money-making stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Boring Stocks That Make Money10. American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $1.3 billion Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) are some of the most boring stocks on the market that also happen to make a lot of money. Another is American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK), which pulled in $1.3 billion in net income over the trailing 12-month period.With a beta of 0.5 and relatively slow revenue and income growth, American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) is a pretty boring stock compared to some of the high-flying stocks out there. The utilities company did surge its EPS by more than $3.00 in 2021 however, hitting $6.96. Also of note is the company’s acquisition spree, with 30 agreements in place as of the end of Q2, which comes hot on the heels of 23 acquisitions being completed last year.Hedge funds have largely been maintaining their stakes in American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) for the past five years, with little overall movement in ownership of the stock. Ian SImm’s Impax Asset Management owns by far the largest stake in the company among the fund’s tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 4.91 million shares of AWK as of June 30.9. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 33 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $2.07 billion If a company that leases public storage units sounds likely to be a boring stock, well it is. But Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a boring stock that’s earned an impressive $2.07 billion in net income over the trailing 12 month period. With a 0.38 beta, it’s a stock that’s not likely to do a whole lot one way or the other barring major news, but the company did have a strong 2021 after multiple years of slower growth. Revenue grew by more than 17% to $3.42 billion, while EPS grew by more than 50% to $9.91.Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) has become a lot more popular among hedge funds over the past year, with the stock hovering around all-time highs in terms of smart money ownership. The company boasts several major industry players as bulls, including Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management and Jeffrey Furber’s AEW Capital Management.The Baron Real Estate Income Fund is bullish on Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)’s leading position in many of its top markets, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Following strong performance in the first quarter of 2022, the shares of Public Storage Incorporated, a REIT that is the world’s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, declined 21% in the second quarter (a similar decline to most other REITs). We remain optimistic about the company’s long-term prospects. Public Storage’s nearly 2,500 self-storage facilities across the U.S. serve more than one million customers. The company has achieved the #1 market position in 14 of its top 15 markets.We are encouraged about the company’s prospects due to our expectations for the continuation of strong occupancy and rent trends, limited new supply, mid-teens organic cash flow growth, the potential for mergers and acquisitions activity in part due to the company’s well-capitalized and low leverage balance sheet, and the ability to increase rents monthly to combat inflation headwinds. We believe Public Storage’s shares are currently valued at a discount to private market self-storage values and offer prospects for mid-teens total returns in the next few years.”8. Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 37 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $113 million Food distributors like Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) aren’t going to set the world on fire, but the company’s on a nice little run right now, with $113 million in trailing 12 month net income and exceptional revenue growth of 67% during its latest fiscal year ended June 30, hitting $50.9 billion thanks to a strong year-over-year rebound for restaurants. That trend appears to have continued in Q3, though the company’s FY23 revenue growth is expected to be no greater than 13.9% against the tougher comps.Hedge fund ownership of Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) jumped by 28% during the second quarter as several hedge funds took notice of the company. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group owns 3.58 million PFGC shares as of June 30, adding a net total of 90,946 shares to its portfolio during Q2.The ClearBridge Investments Select Strategy, which owns 5.42 million Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) shares as of June 30, discussed the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“Performance Food Group is another example of a quality franchise bought during a depressing period for the foodservice industry that has flexed its balance sheet to make acquisitions of weaker players and continues to consolidate its leading market share.”7. Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 39 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $264 million Lithium company Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) has some strong secular tailwinds at its back that make for a somewhat exciting stock, though its past few years of results have been dull at best. The company’s revenue fell slightly between 2018 and 2021, while its EPS crated from more than $6 to just above $1. Those metrics are improving substantially this year however, with the company trending towards record figures across the board.Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) hit an all-time high in hedge fund ownership at the end of 2021, but there was a 20% drop in ownership during the first half of this year. Jay Chen’s Himension Capital owned 383,348 ALB shares on June 30, giving its 8.95% 13F exposure to the stock.Carillon Tower Advisers is bullish on Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)’s opportunity in the electric vehicle space, as the fund discussed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a global specialty chemicals company with leading positions in lithium, bromine, and refining catalysts. The company’s shares outperformed meaningfully in the quarter, driven largely by robust demand for lithium used to manufacture electric vehicle batteries. Albemarle is well-positioned for the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and could benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act.”6. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 45 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $6.76 billion Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) has been about as stable and boring as a stock can get, with trailing 12 month revenue that’s essentially flat from 2018 levels and operating income that’s declined during that time. But the company makes boatloads of money, with more than $6 billion in net income in 2018, 2019, and 2021. It’s also in the midst of a banner year, with Q3 revenue jumping by 21% year-over-year and EPS surging by 46% and crushing estimates. Heck, with growth rates like that, Caterpillar might just be capable of creeping off the most boring stocks list some day.There was a 16% dip in hedge fund ownership of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) during Q2, as hedge funds timed their exits from the stock near its peak. CAT shares would subsequently fall by 29% between June 8 and September 27, but have railed over the last month. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital owns over 1.9 million shares of Caterpillar as of June 30.The Diamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund added Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) to its portfolio during Q1, laying out some of the reasons why in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) are more yawn-inducing stocks that make lots of money.

OHI is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2 after the closing bell. The company’s quarterly results are likely to display a year-over-year decline in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this healthcare REIT delivered an in-line performance in terms of adjusted FFO per share.The company beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met the same in one and missed in the other, the average beat being 1.60%. This is depicted in the graph below.Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOmega Healthcare Investors, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOmega Healthcare Investors, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. QuoteBy investing in the long-term healthcare industry, mainly in skilled nursing (SNF) and assisted living facilities, Omega Healthcare has emerged as a leading SNF-focused REIT and achieved diversification in terms of geography and operator in the United States and the United Kingdom.The company’s properties are operated by a diverse group of healthcare companies, primarily in a triple-net lease structure. This diversification is anticipated to have supported OHI’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the nonpayment of the rent by some operators is likely to have affected the company’s performance in the third quarter. In a September 2022 investor presentation, Omega Healthcare noted that in July 2022, it collected the rent from operators representing roughly 92% of its second-quarter 2022 annualized contractual rent and mortgage obligations.OHI also noted that with many operators still struggling with the pandemic’s impact on occupancy and staffing, there is a high risk that additional operators might not be able to pay per their contractual terms. With low occupancy, the profitability of several facilities is likely to have been affected. These are likely to have pressured the company’s operating performance in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter rental income is pegged at $216.73 million, up from $207.54 million in the prior quarter but down from $243.58 million in the year-ago period. The consensus mark for third-quarter revenues of $249.8 million suggests an 11.3% decrease year over year.Omega Healthcare’s activities during the September-end quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unrevised at 77 cents over the past month. The figure also suggests a 9.4% decline year over year.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for OHI this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an FFO beat.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PSA in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $4.10 per share for PSA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.05 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PSA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.34% heading into earnings season.Public Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage price-eps-surprise | Public Storage QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PSA has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

The company ships its LPDDR5X DRAM chip manufactured with its 1-alpha technology in volume currently, and said the new 1-beta chip has 15% better power efficiency over the older version as well as a 35% improvement on the number of bits stored per area.DRAM chips are memory chips that lose the memory when the power is off, while NAND chips store memory regardless of power.The 1-beta manufacturing technology further shrinks the 1-alpha technology, although Micron didn’t say by how much. Chip making has evolved to fit more and more transistors on a set area of silicon, which for decades has brought down the cost per memory and energy consumption - although some limits are starting to emerge.Micron said it was able to get to the 1-beta manufacturing technology without using the expensive extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography tools, which are used in the latest processor chips in top-end smartphones.Thy Tran, vice president of DRAM Process Integration at Micron, said the new DRAM will be manufactured first in Micron’s plant in Hiroshima, Japan, and later at other high-volume manufacturing sites, including Taiwan.(Reporting By Jane Lanhee Lee; Editing by Leslie Adler)]"

(Nasdaq: MU), announced today that it is shipping qualification samples of its 1β (1-beta) DRAM technology to select smartphone manufacturers and chipset partners and has achieved mass production readiness with the world’s most advanced DRAM technology node. The company is debuting its next generation of process technology on its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) mobile memory, delivering top speed grades of 8.5 gigabits (Gb) per second. The node delivers significant gains across performance, bit density and power efficiency that will have sweeping market benefits. Beyond mobile, 1β delivers the low-latency, low-power, high-performance DRAM that is essential to support highly responsive applications, real-time services, personalization and contextualization of experiences, from intelligent vehicles to data centers.The world’s most advanced DRAM process node, 1β represents an advancement of the company’s market leadership cemented with the volume shipment of 1α (1-alpha) in 2021. The node delivers around a 15% power efficiency improvement and more than a 35% bit density improvement1 with a 16Gb per die capacity.“The launch of our 1-beta DRAM signals yet another leap forward for memory innovation, brought to life by our proprietary multi-patterning lithography in combination with leading-edge process technology and advanced materials capabilities,” said Scott DeBoer, executive vice president of technology and products at Micron. “In delivering the world’s most advanced DRAM technology with more bits per memory wafer than ever before, this node lays the foundation to usher in a new generation of data-rich, intelligent and energy-efficient technologies from the edge to the cloud.”This milestone also follows quickly on the heels of Micron’s shipment of the world’s first 232-layer NAND in July, architected to drive unprecedented performance and areal density for storage. With these new firsts, Micron continues to set the pace for the market across memory and storage innovations — both made possible by the company’s deep roots in cutting-edge research and development (R&amp;D) and manufacturing process technology.Story continuesWith sampling of LPDDR5X, the mobile ecosystem will be the first to reap the benefits of 1β DRAM’s significant gains, which will unlock next-generation mobile innovation and advanced smartphone experiences — all while consuming less power. With 1β’s speed and density, high-bandwidth use cases will be responsive and smooth during downloads, launches and simultaneous use of data-hungry 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Additionally, 1β-based LPDDR5X will not only enhance smartphone camera launch, night mode and portrait mode with speed and clarity, but it will enable shake-free, high-resolution 8K video recording and intuitive in-phone video editing.The low power per bit consumption of 1β process technology delivers the most power-efficient memory technology on the market for smartphones yet. This allows smartphone manufacturers to design devices with more efficient battery life — crucial as consumers look to prolong their batteries while using energy-draining, data-intensive apps.The power savings are also enabled by the implementation of new JEDEC enhanced dynamic voltage and frequency scaling extensions core (eDVFSC) techniques on this 1β-based LPDDR5X. The addition of eDVFSC at a doubled frequency tier of up to 3,200 megabits per second2 provides improved power savings controls to enable more efficient use of power based off unique end user patterns.Micron challenges laws of physics with sophisticated lithography and nanomanufacturingMicron’s industry-first 1β node allows higher memory capacity in a smaller footprint — enabling lower cost per bit of data. DRAM scaling has largely been defined by this ability to deliver more and faster memory per square millimeter of semiconductor area, which requires shrinking the circuits to fit billions of memory cells on a chip roughly the size of a fingernail. With each process node, the semiconductor industry has been shrinking devices every year or two for decades; however, as chips have grown smaller, defining circuit patterns on wafers requires challenging the laws of physics.While the industry has begun to shift to a new tool that uses extreme ultraviolet light to overcome these technical challenges, Micron has tapped into its proven leading-edge nanomanufacturing and lithography prowess to bypass this still emergent technology. Doing so involves applying the company’s proprietary, advanced multi-patterning techniques and immersion capabilities to pattern these miniscule features with the highest precision. The greater capacity delivered by this reduction will also enable devices with small form factors, such as smartphones and IoT devices, to fit more memory into compact footprints.To achieve its competitive edge with 1β and 1α, Micron has also aggressively advanced its manufacturing excellence, engineering capabilities and pioneering R&amp;D over the past several years. This accelerated innovation first enabled Micron’s unprecedented ramp of its 1α node one year ahead of its competition, which established Micron's leadership in both DRAM and NAND for the first time in the company's history.3 Over the years, Micron has further invested billions of dollars in transforming its fabs into leading-edge, highly automated, sustainable and AI-driven facilities. This includes investments in Micron’s plant in Hiroshima, Japan, which will be mass producing DRAM on 1β.1-beta lays ubiquitous foundation for a more interconnected, sustainable worldAs energy-sapping use cases like machine-to-machine communications, AI and machine learning take flight, power-efficient technologies are an increasingly critical need for businesses, especially those looking to meet strict sustainability targets and reduce operating expenses. Researchers have found that training a single AI model can emit five times the lifetime carbon emissions of an American car, including its manufacture. Further, information and communication technology is already predicted to use 20% of the world’s electricity by 2030.Micron’s 1β DRAM node provides a versatile foundation to power advancements in a connected world that needs fast, ubiquitous, energy-efficient memory to fuel digitization, optimization and automation. The high-density, low-power memory fabricated on 1β enables more energy-efficient flow of data between data-hungry smart things, systems and applications, and more intelligence from edge to cloud. Over the next year, the company will begin to ramp the rest of its portfolio on 1β across embedded, data center, client, consumer, industrial and automotive segments, including graphics memory, high-bandwidth memory and more.ResourcesTechnology leadership page: Micron Enables Pervasive, Data-Driven ExperiencesPodcast: Chips Out Loud: Micron’s Journey to 1-Beta DRAM LeadershipAbout Micron Technology, Inc.We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.

Published to help Canadian clients make better decisions about risk management and insurance programs, Aon's report finds that the market continues to remain complex; however, increased competition, along with positive underwriting results and loss activity, has resulted in a transition from a market experiencing significantly challenged results to one focused on profitable growth.While historical market issues have largely settled, 2022 has brought new volatility. Geopolitical uncertainty, ongoing supply chain issues stemming from the residual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic volatility and climate change continue to weigh on the Canadian market, and underwriters are closely monitoring their exposures and deploying capacity based on careful risk selection.As focus shifts to the last quarter of the year, it will be important to keep a watchful eye on how underwriters react to any catastrophic losses. An increase in loss development is also expected in most regions as the costs from earlier events are fully realized. Accelerated inflation, along with supply chain and labour shortages, will further amplify costs, and experts are forecasting a challenging reinsurance renewal period to close out the year.""Inflationary increases to valuations are only one component of the substantial increase in the cost of claims,"" said Russell Quilley, head of Commercial Risk and chief broking officer for Canada at Aon. ""Although inflation has materially increased true exposure values, there is a significant lack of availability of contractors, supplies and equipment, which is extending the recovery periods for business interruption claims. These factors are contributing to material increases in the costs of claims and insurers are insisting on pricing increases to reflect true indemnity costs.""Story continuesOther key findings include:Inflation and rising interest rates continue to dampen growth, but the Canadian economy is predicted to remain strong. Markets are cautiously looking ahead to growth and profitability.Global insured catastrophe losses in the first half of 2022 were US$38 billion, 18 percent above the 21st century average, with severe convective storm (SCS) activity the primary driver.Historically, the largest economic losses occur in the latter half of the year, and the market is continuing to closely monitor the Atlantic hurricane season, SCS and wildfire activity as inflation may further amplify costs.Catastrophe activity has depressed reinsurer shareholder returns and raising capital is challenging. Many reinsurers are mitigating volatility by rebalancing their portfolios, among other strategies.Market conditions are stabilizing but remain complex, as insurers maintain strict underwriting discipline and risk selection. For clients, strategically planning and preparing for renewals is critical.For more information, view the report here.About Aon Aon plc (NYSE: AON) exists to shape decisions for the better — to protect and enrich the lives of people around the world.

If you want to skip our background of why the dollar has been on the rampage this year, and take a look at the top stocks in today's list, head on over to 5 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US Dollar. The hottest topic right now in finance is the U.S. dollar. The dollar is the world's reserve currency, and it is used by most of the emerging economies central banks as their currency. A key reason why the 'greenback' reigns supreme is the oil and economic crisis of the 1970s that saw the U.S. dollar as the only currency available for oil payments and a safe haven asset. As the Bretton Woods financial system that had pegged global currencies to gold ended, the U.S., under President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia that would allow a continuing demand for the dollar in global markets and ensure that the value remained stable. This agreement led to the Saudis agreeing to sell and price oil only in the dollar, and in response, the U.S. agreed to provide military security to Saudi oilfields.From then to the present day, the dollar has reigned supreme and its fortunes are also dependent on oil as a stronger dollar results in lower oil prices due to lower demand from countries that use foreign exchange to buy the fuel. Additionally, a stronger dollar also helps importers that price their goods with the currency, since they can buy more goods. Conversely, exporters benefit when the dollar is weak since it allows them to sell more products overseas for the same dollar amount. As an example, an exporter that sells a good priced at $1 will see more sales if the local currency is stronger as it will bring in more revenue in the local currency for the same dollar unit.The strong dollar has hit American companies hard this year, at a time when they are also seeing sales evaporate at home due to inflation. According to Goldman Sachs, one third, or 29% of firms listed on the Standard and Poor's 500 index, get their sales from overseas. Some, such as the chip giant QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), end up bringing in as much as 96% of their sales from abroad.Story continuesHowever, the dollar might not reign supreme for long. The latest data in the U.S. point out that private sector wage growth dropped to 1.2% in the third quarter from 1.6% in the second quarter. Combined with inflation figures also being lower than economist estimates, there are whispers that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates. Should this happen, and the U.S. economy slows down, the dollar will lose value and as a result help a host of different firms.In this piece, we will take a look at some of the companies that can benefit from a decline in the greenback value and the top picks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US DollarPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a broad look at which firms earn the bulk of their revenue from exports and then narrowed the list down based on their product strength, financial performance, and market factors. Because a major chunk of revenue of these firms comes from outside of the US, a weak dollar is net positive for them.10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US Dollar10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American technology company that offers hardware infrastructure and cloud computing services to other firms. It is headquartered in Armonk, New York.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s third quarter results revealed that out of the $14 billion that the firm had earned in revenue, $6.7 billion came from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. In a quarter hit with inflation, it grew its revenue by 6% and aims to further grow it by 95% annually in the current quarter. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the few technology companies whose shares are up by 1.8% year to date, with others having bled close to half of their value.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) also pays a $1.65 dividend for a 4.76% yield. Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 40 had held a stake in the company.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s largest investor is Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital which owns 2.6 million shares that are worth $372 million.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) joins Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in our list of firms that will benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar.9. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is the world's most famous fast food chain and it operates its own restaurants and licenses its brand to franchises as well. The company's diverse global presence has also seen it cater its menu to local tastes.As McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s second quarter ended, the firm had brought in close to 60% of its $11 billion in revenue in the period from overseas markets. Additionally, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s expenses in foreign territories are also in the U.S. dollar, so it has to pay more local currency units to operate its facilities if the dollar is stronger.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) pays a $1.52 dividend for a 2.21% yield and its shares are up by 2.2% year to date. By the end of this year's second quarter, 50 out of the 895 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had held a stake in the company.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s largest investor is Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates which owns two million shares that are worth $511 million.8. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is the world's largest aerospace company that has its claws in several different markets. These include passenger airplanes, fighter jets, and even spaceships for NASA's International Space Station (ISS) and lunar missions.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reported in October 2022 that it had earned $16 billion in revenue, out of which a little over half was from non-U.S. customers. The quarter was an important one for the company as the company generated positive free cash flow for the first time in more than two years after it embarked on a turnaround effort. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.Insider Monkey's June quarter 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 51 had bought a stake in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA).The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s largest investor is Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global which owns 1.3 million shares that are worth $190 million.Meridian Funds mentioned the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Companrseasy (NYSE:BA), a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”7. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is an American company that explores and produces gold, silver, copper, zinc, and other metals. The firm is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is the largest exporter on our list when it comes to the percentage of the revenue derived from overseas sales. As an illustrative example, by the end of its fiscal year 2021 in December, the company had sold $12 billion worth of metals, out of which only $52 million worth of metals from this were sold in the United States. Its biggest customer was the United Kingdom, as $8 billion of the sales were concentrated in the country.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) pays a 55 cent dividend for a 5.13% yield and Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 56 had held a stake in the firm.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)'s largest investor is Robert Richards' Heathbridge Capital Management which owns 517,380 shares that are worth $21 million.First Eagle Investments mentioned the firm in a recent investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of Colorado-based Newmont, the largest gold miner in the world, experienced weakness in the quarter as falling gold bullion prices and cost inflation hurt miners in general. More idiosyncratically, the company reported slightly disappointing earnings and production results for its most recent quarter due to pandemic-related disruptions, ongoing supply-chain constraints, and labor shortages.It also warned that operating costs for 2022 were likely to come in at the upper end of previous guidance. We remain constructive on the stock, which offers steady production anchored in good jurisdictions, a good pipeline of organic projects, a strong balance sheet, and proven management.”6.

""So it feels like markets want to see some positive development in terms of a dovish message from the Fed. But really we are not at that juncture yet because if you look at core inflation, it's still very, very sticky.""The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 14% in October, on track to notch its best performance since 1976. Gains for the Dow have been rather broad-based — including an 18% increase for JP Morgan and a 13% pop for McDonald's — while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are up 7.5% and 2.5% on the month, respectively.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.These gains have come despite the threat of even higher interest rates and a subpar earnings season (see warnings from Amazon and Meta). And BlackRock's Li thinks the returning enthusiasm for stocks will be met with a test out of the gate in November, notably from more hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve at its latest policy meeting this week.""We believe that rates will continue rising,"" Li explained. ""It will peak at 5%. And not too understate it, that's a very, very restrictive territory. In fact, where we are now, at 3.25%, is already restrictive to the economy. So our belief is that in this current supply-constrained environment, the Fed is going to have to engineer a recession in order to bring down inflation. Our assessment is that if they were to want to bring down inflation to 2% reasonably quickly, it represents a 2% shock to the U.S. economy in 2023. It also represents 3 million additional people out of a job, pushing unemployment rate to 5%.""Story continuesStock trader Peter Tuchman (L) works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on October 27, 2022 in New York City.

369,f115953d-125b-3f11-892a-3d9837a0bcd5,TRIP,2022-11-01,TripAdvisor (TRIP) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tripadvisor-trip-earnings-expected-grow-140002212.html,1667224802,STORY,"['TRIP', 'MELI']","[The market expects TripAdvisor (TRIP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 7, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis travel website operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +143.8%.Revenues are expected to be $445.19 million, up 46.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.55% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TripAdvisor?For TripAdvisor, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +9.69%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that TripAdvisor will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TripAdvisor would post earnings of $0.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.37, delivering a surprise of +37.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TripAdvisor appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, MercadoLibre (MELI), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.31 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +20.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.69 billion, up 44.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for MercadoLibre has been revised 9.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.68%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MercadoLibre will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 11.81, while its industry has an average P/E of 32.91. PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.10 and as low as 10.39, with a median of 11.91, all within the past year.PCAR is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.18. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.21. Within the past year, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.81 and as low as 1.04, with a median of 1.19.We should also highlight that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.61. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 4.90. Within the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 2.93 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.53.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 10.91. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. PCAR's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 15.51. Over the past year, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 12.21 and as low as 9.16, with a median of 10.68.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that PACCAR is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

380,98fe30b8-6f3a-3b32-8ecb-143cdac09f73,UPS,2022-11-01,15 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-ipos-time-worldwide-190207873.html,1667242927,STORY,"['ABNB', 'RIVN', 'UPS', 'UBER', 'BABA', 'META', 'MBLY', 'GM', 'V']","[In this article, we discuss the 15 largest IPOs of all time. If you want to read about some more popular IPOs, go directly to 5 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide. As of September 28, 2022, there have been a total of 992 IPOs year-to-date, raising $146 billion, a 44% and 57% decrease year-over-year, respectively. IPO companies and investors faced heightening macroeconomic challenges, market uncertainties, growing volatility, and declining global equity prices. Volatility (CBOE VIX average) rose from 19.7 in 2021 to 25.6 year-to-date in 2022. The technology sector led IPOs in terms of the number of IPOs, although the average deal size dropped from $261 million to $123 million year-over-year. Q3 2022 had the least SPAC IPO proceeds since Q3 2016, and SPACs struggled to find proper targets. Similarly, as of October 2022, NASDAQ has halted the initial public offering (IPO) preparations of at least four small Chinese firms as it probes the limited rallies of such firms after their market debuts, as per lawyers and bankers who are part of these IPOs. NASDAQ took this action as Chinese companies that raise nearly $50 million or less in their IPOs gain about 2,000% during their market debut, only to plummet in the following days. This crushes investors who are daring enough to bet on penny stocks. As per an EY report dated September 30, U.S. initial public offerings (IPOs) dropped 74% during the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, bludgeoned by market volatility, high inflation, rising interest rates, and threats posed by COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rachel Gerring, the IPO leader in EY Americas, noted that the market needs more stability. 2021 was a record year for IPOs, and she said that those firms “have severely underperformed in the aftermarket, significantly impacting companies’ desires to go public as they navigate ongoing market volatility.”There were 83 IPOs in the United States during the first three quarters of 2022, generating $7.27 billion, representing the least rate of proceeds since 2003, EY said. More than 53% of the IPOs in the first three quarters of 2022 decided to list on Chinese exchanges, including Hong Kong. This year’s quarterly growth demonstrates how China’s IPO market has shown meaningful strength in recent years, drawing upon a robust pipeline of industrial, technology, and consumer non-cyclical companies. Story continuesNearly 75% of large US companies that went public during the pandemic are now trading under their IPO price, pushing some rising start-ups back to private buyers at low valuations. Of more than 400 IPO listings where companies raised at least $100 million between 2019 and 2021, 76% are now trading below their IPO prices, as per Financial Times data. The group’s median return since their IPO dates is negative 44%. The IPO firms which sank this year include overhyped names like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH), all of whom were publicly listed during a pandemic-driven market surge that concluded in late 2021.Although the global IPO market has faced large declines in 2022, some of the largest IPOs of all time are still thriving. These companies have carved out strategic market positions for themselves over the years. With this outlook in mind, let’s dive into 15 largest IPOs of all time worldwide. 15 Largest IPOs of All Time WorldwideImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology We selected the largest IPOs in the world based on the capital raised and the buzz around the firms at the time of their IPOs. We have mentioned the details of the initial public offerings with each company for additional context.Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15. Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $21.818 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $16.7 billion Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced on December 6, 2021 that it is separating its Mobileye division via an IPO. On October 25, 2022, Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY) disclosed an initial public offering of 41 million units of its Class A common stock at an IPO price of $21.00 per share, which is higher than the priorly announced per share price of $18-$20. The stock started trading on NASDAQ on October 26. The market cap of Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY) came in at nearly $22 billion on October 28. Mobileye was previously publicly traded before Intel acquired the Israeli company in 2017 for $15.3 billion. It is one of the most notable IPOs of 2022, and the stock price has climbed almost 37% to $27 as of October 28. Mobileye develops autonomous driving technologies and complex driver-assistance systems.Mobileye Global Inc. Class A Common Stock (NASDAQ:MBLY) has made huge headlines with its IPO, just like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH). 14. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $178.715 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $25 billionIn 2014, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was considered to be one of the largest global IPOs, raising $25 billion at $68 per share. The stock surged 38% on the first day of trading. Alibaba is one of the largest Chinese tech giants, and it is dually listed in the US and Hong Kong. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) declined 30% during the quarter primarily due to the continued impact of China’s zero-COVID policy. In August, more than 70 Chinese cities with 300 million combined population were in some state of lockdown. Unfortunately, this comes on top of the other regulatory and competitive challenges that had previously been pressuring Alibaba’s shares over the past year. The painful decline in the share price has made Alibaba a poor investment so far—for good reason. In the second quarter, core online e-commerce revenues were down 10%, and adjusted profits declined 18%. That said, Alibaba shares are priced for this terrible environment to continue forever, and many of the exogenous issues should eventually abate. Signs suggest the regulatory pressure is already easing. The government has been stepping in with economic stimulus. The zero-COVID policy must eventually end. In addition, Alibaba’s management has taken important steps to improve profitability by reducing investments in loss-making new business ventures. When the environment improves, we believe that Alibaba’s core business franchises will return to growth, and profits will follow. The disconnect between Alibaba’s price and value continues to be one of the biggest we have seen in our careers.”13. SoftBank Group CorpMarket Capitalization as of October 28: $63.7 billion  Amount Raised at IPO: $23.5 billionJapan’s SoftBank Corp started trading publicly in December 2018, and it was one of the largest IPOs the world had seen. SoftBank Corp is the telecoms division of Japanese billionaire CEO Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group. SoftBank Corp raised 2.65 trillion yen, or $23.5 billion, after pricing the IPO units at 1,500 yen per share. The market capitalization as of October 28 stood at nearly $64 billion. 12. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $430.523 billion  Amount Raised at IPO: $17.9 billionVisa Inc. (NYSE:V), the American multinational payments technology firm, had its IPO in March 2008. The company raised $17.9 billion as investors jumped on its growth potential coming out of the US mortgage crisis. Visa sold 406 million class A common stock for $44 per share, above the forecast $37-$42. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is partnering with blockchain firms to offer crypto debit cards, a new offering in addition to its card products, payment platforms, and value-added services.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We reinitiated a small position in Visa, which we had previously owned for years (selling out of the position at higher levels in February). We continue to believe that the long-term secular growth trend towards digital payments remains intact and has been further enhanced by the COVID crisis. The growth in debit cards, contactless payments, e-commerce, and now, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), are all driving digital payment penetration, and we continue to be impressed with the long-term growth potential of V (and our other payment holdings Mastercard, Adyen, and PayPal).”11. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $73.223 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $3.5 billionAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), the California-based travel technology firm, had a massive initial public offering in 2020. The company opened at $146 per share on the NASDAQ, far ahead of the IPO price of $68 per share. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) amassed a market cap of about $86.5 billion, more than double the IPO valuation it sought a day earlier. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is one of the best IPO stocks of all time. Here is what Polen Capital specifically said about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) was one of our largest detractors from performance in the second quarter. Airbnb is the clear market leader in private rental bookings globally, according to market research firm Euromonitor. The business is currently firing on all cylinders, with revenue and earnings growth well above our expectations and long-term estimates. It would be easy to say that it is because as the world reopens, people are traveling for the first time in two years, providing a short-term benefit to the company. But, Airbnb also grew quickly in 2021 when people were still hesitant to travel and preferred staying close to home. The company’s growth in 2022 is not an easy comparison like it is for online travel agencies (which are more hotel-oriented), airlines, and hotels. In fact, Airbnb’s business has outpaced the hotel industry growth by more than 1,250 basis points per year since 2019, showing far more resilience than hotels and online travel agencies.Airbnb didn’t invent the private rental market, but it developed a better offering and helped it scale with robust network effects and a system of trust protecting travelers and hosts alike. It has diligently removed friction from the marketplace to catalyze demand.The business model has very high incremental profit margins. When the company went public only a year and a half ago, it had pretax profit margins on a non-GAAP basis of approximately 5% by our calculations. This year, those margins should approach 30%. In addition, the company has generated approximately $3 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. The runway for growth in private rental is very long, especially considering that hybrid work will likely remain for the long-term, allowing for more business/leisure trips that work better in Airbnbs than hotels, in our view…” (Click here to read full text)10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $266.215 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $16 billionMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) debuted on the NASDAQ on May 18, 2012. The initial public offering of 421.23 million shares was priced at $38 each, and the trade opened at $42.05 per share, a gain of approximately 11%. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was thus worth over $100 billion and managed to raise $16 billion by selling its initial shares. It was one of the largest tech IPOs in the world. Meta is valued at more than $266 billion as of October 28, and it is one of the biggest companies in the world by market cap. Here is what Giverny Capital specifically said about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Our worst performers for the year-to-date have been painful. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is down roughly 60%, and Carmax, Eurofins Scientific, Coherent and Ciena have lost about half their value. I’m wearing a dunce cap for Meta, as the changes Apple made to privacy tracking severely impacted Meta’s effectiveness at targeting ads to the right consumers. However, despite being compared recently to AOL by one analyst, Meta continues to capture enormous amounts of consumer attention: roughly 2.9 billion people use one of its sites every day. I believe it has a very long runway on monetizing those eyeballs, especially outside North America. For all its problems with ad tracking, and despite heavy investment in the so called metaverse, Meta should earn about $10 per share in 2022 and more next year. The stock, at $136 on September 30, reflects pessimism that Meta will ever recover. We’re holding because we think that Meta has the resources to improve its advertising efficiency, and that it eventually will.”9. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $56.55 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $15.77 billionGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM), the American automaker manufacturing trucks, crossovers, and electric cars, had one of the largest IPOs of all time in November 2010. The company sold 478 million common shares priced at $33 each, raising $15.77 billion, as well as $4.35 billion in preferred stock, higher than the initially planned $4 billion. As of October 28, 2022, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has a market cap of more than $56.5 billion. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital specifically said about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Auto manufacturer General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) was also among our bottom contributors in Q2. Rising interest rates and continued supply chain issues have increased uncertainty surrounding the auto industry, exerting downward pressure on stocks of auto makers. We continue to like GM’s focus on its most profitable market segments (SUV, crossovers, trucks) and believe the company’s heavy investments in autonomous capabilities will position it favorably as the secular movement towards autonomous vehicles continues.”8. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $30.477 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $12 billion Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and related accessories. The IPO was priced at $78 a share, valuing Rivian at $66.5 billion. The Amazon-backed electric vehicle maker had a market valuation exceeding $100 billion a day after its IPO on November 9, 2021. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) was one of the largest IPOs of 2021. Here is what Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund has to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Rivian Automotive, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells consumer and commercial electric vehicles. Shares of Rivian declined 48.2% in the second quarter as investors continued rotating out of long-duration assets and have become increasingly concerned about capital intensity and cash burn.At the same time, Rivian continues to be impacted by supply chain issues which are causing delays in its production ramp. Rivian is addressing those challenges by diversifying its supply chain to alleviate shortages while also consolidating the number of variants in development to reduce cash burn (the company guided that current cash will be enough to support the company’s future platform launch ‘R2’ in 2025). Rivian recently reported stronger-than-expected second quarter production numbers while reiterating its annual guidance of producing 25,000 units.As semiconductor shortages ease, we believe that the company will be able to rapidly ramp its production. We retain conviction in the shares given management’s vision, Rivian’s product positioning, the company’s relationship with Amazon.com, and its strong balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, Rivian had $17 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which will help it overcome the current challenges while taking advantage of the long-term opportunity as the market transitions to electric vehicles.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $54.576 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $8.1 billionUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), the American firm providing technology-led ride sharing services, features as one of the largest IPOs of all time worldwide. Uber listed publicly on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10, 2019, with an IPO price of $45 per share. Bankers floated a valuation of about $120 billion for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), however, the mobility firm did not touch that figure. As of October 28, 2022, Uber is valued at nearly $55 billion. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Uber was our top contributor for the quarter on better-than-expected 2Q results, and 3Q EBITDA guidance that was well ahead of Street estimates. The company reported 33% Gross Bookings growth from both the continued recovery of Mobility Gross Bookings, up 55% year over year, and the continuation of Delivery Gross Bookings growth, up 7% year over year. Overall, revenue grew 105% year over year to $8 billion, generating $364 million of adjusted EBITDA, up $873 million year over year. Management guided to 25%-30% gross bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA of $440-$470 million for 3Q. Significantly, FCF was positive at $382 million, up $780 million year over year, and remains on track to be positive for the year allowing the company to self-fund future growth.UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the expectation of substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its more than 120 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as grocery delivery, truck brokerage (the company had $1.8 billion in Freight revenue for 2Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $10 billion of cash and investments against $9 billion of debt, the company today has an enterprise value of $57 billion indicating that UBER trades at only 1.5x next year’s estimated revenue.”6. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Market Capitalization as of October 28: $144.634 billion Amount Raised at IPO: $5.5 billionUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is an American company that provides letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services. On November 10, 1999, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) offered 109,400,000 shares on the NYSE. The IPO stock price was $50 per share. The stock closed its first day with a 35% gain. It was one of the largest IPOs of all time worldwide. The current market cap, as of October 28, stands at nearly $145 billion. Although IPO firms like Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), and DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) failed to dazzle the market, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is one of the most successful IPOs of all time. Here is what ClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG Strategy has to say about United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide.  Suggested articles:Most Educated Countries in the WorldBest Stocks For Beginners with Little MoneyBest Shipping and Container Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

MLM is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5% and revenues (products and services) topped the same by 2.9%. On a year-over-year basis, earnings of this aggregates producer increased 3.9%. Products and services revenues rose 17.6%. Total quarterly revenues (including Product and Services and Freight revenues) were up 19.1% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Martin Marietta’s earnings topped the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters and missed on the other two occasions, with the average negative surprise being 8%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Martin Marietta’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.74 per share, suggesting a rise of 11.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $4.25. The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $1.67 billion, indicating a 14.2% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteMartin Marietta’s quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to have witnessed year-over-year growth in the third quarter, given the strong pricing gains in aggregates and strength in public construction. Improved visibility in residential and non-residential construction and contributions from acquisitions are also likely to have been the positives.Infrastructure construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and roads and streets, might have also contributed to its performance in the quarter, as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded. Also, resilient pricing may have been a tailwind.However, inflation from hydrocarbon, rising liquid asphalt and diesel fuel costs, more transportation costs and insurance and labor cost may have impacted the bottom line of Martin Marietta and its peers like Vulcan Materials Company VMC. Also, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs, supply and contract costs and supply-chain bottlenecks are added concerns.The business and earnings of MLM have been sensitive to changes in construction spending, particularly housing and public construction in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida as well as Iowa. Delayed federal spending is likely to have ailed revenues.Story continuesOther ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Building Material segment revenues (product and services), which comprise 95% of total revenues, is pegged at $1,603 million, implying 8.4% growth from a year ago.The consensus estimate for Magnesia Specialties revenues (product and services) is currently pegged at $71 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 1.4% from $72 million reported a year ago.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Martin Marietta this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Currently, MLM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -1.99%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.About VMCVulcan: The construction aggregates company’s focus on four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation — will enhance the price performance and operating efficiencies. Vulcan has been generating higher earnings despite tepid revenues due to prudent cost-control efforts and increased pricing in aggregates. Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives.VMC is likely to miss expectations when it reports third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of -3.07%.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are two companies in the Zacks Construction sector, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their respective quarters to be reported.Based in Winchester, VA, Trex Company, Inc. TREX — which manufactures and distributes decking, railing, and outdoor living products and accessories — topped earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 10.8%.TREX is poised to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 31, after market close. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +25.62%, at present.Continued investments by customers in enhancing their outdoor living experience are likely to have aided the company’s quarterly performance. Favorable pricing/mix and focus on cost reduction efforts and production efficiencies are added positives.Headquartered in Dothan, AL, Construction Partners, Inc. ROAD is a civil infrastructure company. Organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the attractive southeastern U.S. road construction/repair market are expected to drive the company’s growth. It missed earnings estimates in three the trailing four quarters and met once, with the average negative surprise being 75.6%.ROAD is poised to beat expectations when it reports its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +8.00%, at present.Strong demand for infrastructure services throughout end markets in both the private and public sectors, consistent execution of its business model, and a growth strategy that focuses on operational performance and effective project execution are likely to have aided the company’s quarterly performance.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company also outlined its commitment to achieve a 50 percent intensity reduction of Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (produced by an organization’s value chain) by 2030, and a 42 percent reduction of Scope 1 (controlled or owned by an organization) and Scope 2 (electricity, heat, and cooling purchases) GHG emissions through adoption of a science-aligned target.""The unparalleled environmental challenges we face require everyone to be a part of the solution. We are deeply integrating sustainability into the strategy and operational priorities of our business,"" said George Kurian, Chief Executive Officer at NetApp. ""It’s our belief that the world’s ongoing energy challenges require innovative solutions and we’re steadfastly committed to continuing to develop energy-efficient technologies and solutions that allow our customers to greatly reduce their carbon footprint.

BlueXP provides power-consumption reporting with dashboards that allow companies to make decisions about moving critical data to balance business needs with carbon efficiency.NetApp Cloud Insights Dashboard is a new feature that reports on power usage and temperature for ONTAP storage. NetApp Cloud Insights provides visibility and reporting of an organization’s use of compute and storage across all on-premises and cloud environments to find and address waste and inefficiencies, which helps customers make informed decisions that can reduce costs and waste, including those around reducing emissions.Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) carbon footprint reports leveraging the Product Attribute Impact Algorithm (PAIA) methodology. NetApp was the first storage-focused provider to join PAIA, a consortium of information and communication technology peers, sponsored by MIT.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Natural Gas Dividend Stocks To Buy. As per the The Business Research Company, the natural gas market size is expected to increase from $0.84 trillion in 2021 to $0.94 trillion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. The global natural gas market is forecasted to grow to $1.23 trillion in 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9%. On October 27, The US Energy Information Administration announced a largely bullish 52 Bcf increase to natural gas inventories during the last week, driven by high winter heating demand across the Central and Eastern US tightening the local supply and demand equilibrium. However, this was lower than the consensus expectation for a 65 Bcf addition to gas inventories by S&amp;P Global. A new global gas world order is underway, as the 50-year gas trade between Europe and Russia unravels in the wake of the Russian war on Ukraine. Suppliers are rearranging their trade patterns, and producers are looking into new prospects and opportunities for creating alternative supply sources. This gives way to multiple players entering the market or expanding their share as end-markets move away from Russian gas. Some of the best natural gas stocks to invest in, which also pay generous dividends, include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), and Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK). Our Methodology We chose the following natural gas dividend stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and resilient dividend profiles. The dividend yields as of October 28 have been mentioned. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. 10 Best Natural Gas Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Max Bender on UnsplashBest Natural Gas Dividend Stocks To Buy10. Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 9Dividend Yield as of October 28: 3.56%Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) was incorporated in 1972 and is headquartered in Stavanger, Norway. The company engages in the exploration, production, and transportation of petroleum and petroleum-derived products. Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) also transports, processes, markets, and trades in oil and gas commodities, such as crude and condensate products, gas liquids, natural gas, and liquefied natural gas. Story continuesOn October 28, Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on January 25, 2023, to shareholders of record on January 10. Additionally, the board also declared an extraordinary cash dividend of $0.70. Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR)’s dividend yield on October 28 came in at 3.56%, making it one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. SEB Equities analyst Anders Rosenlund upgraded Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) to Buy from Hold with a NOK 450 price target on September 7. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 9 hedge funds were bullish on Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), compared to 16 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest position holder in the company, with 10.25 million shares worth $356.45 million. In addition to Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), and Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK), Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) is one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. Here is what Massif Capital has to say about Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“We currently have two oil-related positions in our portfolio and believe the oil opportunity set is ripe. As one might expect, both positions, (including Equinor: EQNR) performed well during the second quarter, given the steady march higher that oil has made in recent months. We maintain a positive outlook for both companies, although, importantly, our posture is not predicated on an expectation for continued oil price appreciation. This is not because of our inability to imagine scenarios where that does occur, but more out of an abundance of caution for what is a highly volatile commodity that at current price levels should be more than sufficient to generate ample free cash flow for any investable oil firm.In the future, we expect both firms in the portfolio to generate significant free cash flow and expect EQNR to reinvest that free cash flow into a combination of offshore oil and wind opportunities with high rates of return. The path forward for AOI is more complicated and does warrant a few comments.”9. New Fortress Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Dividend Yield as of October 28: 0.73%New Fortress Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NFE) is a New York-based integrated gas-to-power infrastructure company that supplies energy and development services to end-users worldwide. The company offers natural gas procurement and liquefaction, storage and regasification units, and liquefied natural gas carriers. Jefferies analyst Sam Burwell on October 19 initiated coverage of New Fortress Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NFE) with a Buy rating and a $65 price target. He believes the ""Option Value"" of energy is up again, supported by a constrained capital cycle. While this is most pronounced in oil &amp; gas, it is also seen in energy transition names, said the analyst, who thinks energy's ""Option Value can stay higher for longer"" without a significant increase in investment across the sector. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 21 hedge funds were bullish on New Fortress Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NFE) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 19 funds in the prior quarter. Michael Novogratz’s Fortress Investment Group is the largest position holder in the company, with 13.4 million shares worth $530.2 million. 8. NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Dividend Yield as of October 28: 3.63%NiSource Inc.

(NYSE:BP) is a London-based energy firm which operates through Gas &amp; Low Carbon Energy, Oil Production &amp; Operations, Customers &amp; Products, and Rosneft segments. It is one of the best dividend stocks to consider. On October 17, BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) agreed to acquire Archaea Energy Inc. (NYSE:LFG) for nearly $26 per share in cash, or a total enterprise value of $4.1 billion, including $800 million of net debt.HSBC analyst Kim Fustier on October 24 upgraded BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) to Buy from Hold with a 530 GBp price target. European oil firms have ""visibly lagged"" U.S. peers in the recent rally, creating an ""unjustified"" valuation gap, the analyst told investors. The analyst thinks macro drivers should continue to lead the sector higher and oil stocks should act defensively if the economic environment deteriorates further. She cited valuation for the upgrade of BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) and believes that oil names can continue to perform on higher crude prices into the end of this year. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 27 hedge funds were bullish on BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) at the end of June 2022, with combined stakes worth about $1.8 billion.

(NYSE:EOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Dividend Yield as of October 28: 2.24%EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is a Texas-based company that explores for, develops, produces, and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. On September 29, EOG Resources, Inc.

(NYSE:EOG) to $150 from $139 and reaffirmed a Buy rating on the shares ahead of the Q3 results. The analyst refreshed his model to capture EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG)’s latest Q3 hedge loss and cash settlement payments for other hedges, as the company moves towards hedging less of its production going forward.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) was part of 43 public stock portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 49 funds in the earlier quarter. Harris Associates held the leading position in the company, comprising 7.6 million shares worth $838.3 million. Like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), and Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK), EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is one of the top natural gas dividend stocks to consider. Here is what Oakmark Select Fund has to say about EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) (+36%), was among our top contributors in the quarter as oil prices rallied due to tight supplies, which were then exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Natural Gas Dividend Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Largest Gas Station Chains in the US10 Best Medical Stocks Under $511 Popular Penny Stocks on Robinhood Disclosure: None. 10 Best Natural Gas Dividend Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The metric also came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The adjustments include certain non-recurring expenses/benefits like amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses, among others.GAAP EPS in the reported quarter was $1.43, up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter’s EPS.RevenuesFiscal first-quarter revenues on a reported basis increased 5.1% year over year (up 9% at the constant exchange rate or CER) to $950.3 million. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%.A Closer View of the Q1 Top LineTotal Sleep and Respiratory Care revenues in the United States, Canada and Latin America improved 18% from the prior-year period to $578.1 million.Total Sleep and Respiratory Care revenues in Europe, Asia and other markets fell 16% on a reported basis and fell 6% at CER to $266.3 million.Global revenues from total Sleep and Respiratory Care in the quarter under review were $844.4 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 9% at CER.Meanwhile, Software as a Service (SaaS) revenues grew 9% to $105.9 million.ResMed Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)ResMed Inc. PE Ratio (TTM)ResMed Inc. pe-ratio-ttm | ResMed Inc. QuoteThe revenue growth in the quarter was backed byincreased demand for the company’s sleep products across its portfolio and ongoing device demand generated by ResMed’s competitors' product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign exchange, in particular, a weaker euro, negatively impacted revenues by approximately $36 million in the reported quarter.MarginsAdjusted gross profit in the quarter under review rose 5.8% to $547.2 million despite a 4.3% uptick in the cost of sales (excluding expenses related to amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring). Adjusted gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 57.6%, reflecting a 35-basis point (bps) expansion.The increase is attributable to increases in average selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and foreign exchange headwinds.Story continuesSelling, general and administrative expenses rose 9.7% year over year to $193.9 million (up 16% at CER). Research and development expenses increased 5.4% to $63.2 million (up 9% at CER).Adjusted operating income was $290.1 million in the quarter under discussion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin however contracted 52 bps year over year to 30.5%.Financial UpdatesResMed exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $207.2 million compared with $201.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Total debt (short and long-term) at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter was 795.3 million compared with $$775.2 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the fiscal first quarter was $44.7 million, compared with a cumulative net cash outflow of $65.7million in the year-ago quarter.   The company paid out $64.4 million as dividendsduring the fiscal first quarter.Our TakeResMed exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected revenues and in-line earnings. The company recorded a robust sales performance in the quarter on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. The company registered strong customer uptake of the re-engineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device. The company continues to increase its access to semiconductor communications chips. However, the FX headwind negatively impacted revenues by approximately $36 million in the reported quarter.The contraction of the operating margin as a result of escalating expenses is discouraging. The persistent supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment are hampering ResMed’s ability to meet the growing device demand.Zacks Rank and Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Elevance Health Inc.

389,e01f31a7-d241-3a02-9e9d-39bf7f035244,TSCO,2022-11-01,Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) Is Reinvesting At Lower Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tractor-supply-nasdaq-tsco-reinvesting-172617574.html,1667237177.0,STORY,['TSCO'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Tractor Supply is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$1.4b ÷ (US$7.9b - US$2.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Tractor Supply has an ROCE of 25%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Specialty Retail industry average of 18%. View our latest analysis for Tractor Supply roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Tractor Supply compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Tractor Supply doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 34% where it was five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Tractor Supply is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 306% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Tractor Supply   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should know about.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

396,3f40058a-d02a-3e4d-b297-70e021ead1ea,OXY,2022-11-01,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-occidental-petroleum-130001961.html,1667221201,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +16.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has gained 22.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $2.48 per share, indicating a change of +185.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -20.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.07 points to a change of +294.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -8.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.29 indicates a change of -17.7% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $9.35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +37.3%. The $37.74 billion and $34.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +43.4% and -7.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $10.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +78.6%. EPS of $3.16 for the same period compares with $0.32 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.22%. The EPS surprise was +7.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This outperformance was largely due to robust results in certain segments.Moreover, the bottom line strengthened considerably compared to the year-ago quarter’s loss of 1 cent per share. This can be attributed to greater year-over-year revenues from the Subsea Robotics, Manufactured Products and Offshore Projects Group segments. However, Oceaneering’s total quarterly revenues of $559.7 million marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $561 million due to a decrease in year-over-year sales in a couple of OII’s units.

398,988647ba-d206-3b69-b975-062479e235de,COF,2022-11-01,Exclusive-Brazil coffee defaults spike for second year in a row,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-brazil-coffee-defaults-spike-112937190.html,1667302177,STORY,['KC=F'],"[By Maytaal Angel and Marcelo TeixeiraLONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brazilian coffee farmers are defaulting on contracts for a second straight year, according to traders and lawyers representing the industry, failing to deliver on pre-agreed sales and exposing trade houses to losses.The defaults, though less widespread than last year, have scrambled the coffee market, leaving traders reluctant to agree to forward sales for next year's crop or the one after.Defaults started to pick up last year after a series of price shocks caused by severe frosts that ruined the harvest.This year's harvest was smaller than expected. Some analysts cut their initial estimates by nearly 4 million bags as trees have taken longer to recover from 2021's frosts and drought. Coffee prices in August and September traded between $2.17 and $2.21 per pound, over 70% higher than two years ago.The surge in prices gave Brazilian farmers an opening to default on contracts so they could sell beans on the spot market, earning a higher price that outweighs any liability for a default.Several major exporters such as Sucafina, Olam, Louis Dreyfus and COFCO, as well as co-ops including No. 1 exporter Cooxupe, are legally battling farmers for compensation over contract defaults, according to court documents seen by Reuters.Sucafina, Olam, Dreyfus and COFCO did not respond to requests for comment. Cooxupe declined to comment.""We've been told to have less exposure with (Brazilian farmers). It's going to be one or two years until traders forget"" and start buying forward again, said a trader at a large international commodities trading company, asking not to be named.WIDER IMPACT OF DEFAULTSForward selling by farmers and exporters from top exporter Brazil is an important feature of the market. Advance sales help reduce market fluctuations because they allow farmers to sell throughout the year, not just during harvest.Lawyer Cristiano Zauli from Cristiano Zauli Advogados law firm, who assists traders in cases against Brazilian farmers, said he had filed around 50 lawsuits this year against about 100 last year, seeking compensation from coffee producers who have failed to deliver.Story continuesHe said he had obtained court orders to seize coffee at farms, similar to last year when harsh frosts damaged around 15% of Brazil's coffee crop and pushed prices to multi-year highs.Traders said this year's wave of defaults caused the ICE futures price to spike in late September ahead of the front month contract expiry, and could do so again ahead of the December contract expiry on Dec. 19.Traders who buy coffee a year or two in advance usually hedge purchases by taking short futures positions. When futures rise, they take a loss on that position, but can offset it with a similar rally in physical coffee prices.However, when farmers default, traders do not have the physical coffee to sell to offset the futures market. Instead, traders cover short positions by buying more futures, magnifying wild swings in the market.That's what happened in September, when Arabica coffee futures rose from around 2.16 cents per pound to 2.32 cents late in the month, a 7% increase.A lawyer working for one of the five largest coffee exporters in Brazil said the defaults concerned less than 10% of Brazil's total forward contracts. That would still be a significant amount since Brazil produces about 35% of the world's coffee.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Bernadette Baum)]"

The Zacks analyst believes that Disney+'s profitability in recent times was negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney's leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.However, the company continues to benefit from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. Availability in the Nordics, Latin America and other Asian territories is helping it expand its user base. Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both the domestic and international parks.(You can read the full research report on Walt Disney here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Broadcom have declined -31.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry's decline of -40.4%. The Zacks analyst believes that increasing competition, along with high debt levels, are persistent overhangs. But Broadcom did report impressive third-quarter fiscal 2022 results.Story continuesTop-line growth was driven by strength in cloud and service provider segments. Networking is riding on strong adoption of Broadcom's next-gen merchant switching and routing solutions by hyperscalers, enterprises and service providers. Aggressive adoption of its next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth.Broadcom expects fiscal fourth-quarter networking and server storage revenues to grow 30% and 45% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. An upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 guidance is encouraging. The VMware acquisition will aid prospects over the long term.(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of PayPal have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past three-month period (+0.9% vs. -16.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that PayPal is benefiting from growing total payments volume owing to increasing net new active accounts. Strengthening customer engagement on the company's platform is a major positive. Further, Venmo's improving monetization efforts and rising adoption rate across various platforms are aiding the total active accounts growth.However, intensifying competition in the digital payment market poses a serious risk to the company's market position.

The hottest topic right now in finance is the U.S. dollar. The dollar is the world's reserve currency, and it is used by most of the emerging economies central banks as their currency. A key reason why the 'greenback' reigns supreme is the oil and economic crisis of the 1970s that saw the U.S. dollar as the only currency available for oil payments and a safe haven asset. As the Bretton Woods financial system that had pegged global currencies to gold ended, the U.S., under President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia that would allow a continuing demand for the dollar in global markets and ensure that the value remained stable. This agreement led to the Saudis agreeing to sell and price oil only in the dollar, and in response, the U.S. agreed to provide military security to Saudi oilfields.From then to the present day, the dollar has reigned supreme and its fortunes are also dependent on oil as a stronger dollar results in lower oil prices due to lower demand from countries that use foreign exchange to buy the fuel. Additionally, a stronger dollar also helps importers that price their goods with the currency, since they can buy more goods. Conversely, exporters benefit when the dollar is weak since it allows them to sell more products overseas for the same dollar amount. As an example, an exporter that sells a good priced at $1 will see more sales if the local currency is stronger as it will bring in more revenue in the local currency for the same dollar unit.The strong dollar has hit American companies hard this year, at a time when they are also seeing sales evaporate at home due to inflation. According to Goldman Sachs, one third, or 29% of firms listed on the Standard and Poor's 500 index, get their sales from overseas. Some, such as the chip giant QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), end up bringing in as much as 96% of their sales from abroad.Story continuesHowever, the dollar might not reign supreme for long. The latest data in the U.S. point out that private sector wage growth dropped to 1.2% in the third quarter from 1.6% in the second quarter. Combined with inflation figures also being lower than economist estimates, there are whispers that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates. Should this happen, and the U.S. economy slows down, the dollar will lose value and as a result help a host of different firms.In this piece, we will take a look at some of the companies that can benefit from a decline in the greenback value and the top picks are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Weak US DollarPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a broad look at which firms earn the bulk of their revenue from exports and then narrowed the list down based on their product strength, financial performance, and market factors.

Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”7.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks Under $20. Before dividend stocks, growth companies were all the rage as they reinvested capital to grow their businesses. The trend started with the rise of tech stocks in the 1990s that were focused on growth. However, the volatile stock market has brought dividend stocks into the limelight this year. Investors are looking for a way to generate returns in this period of slow economic growth and are turning to dividend stocks. Historically, dividend stocks have shown tremendous performance during inflationary periods.According to a report by AllianceBernstein, dividend-paying stocks protect against inflation with long-term return potential. The report also mentioned that high-dividend stocks delivered a risk-adjusted return of 0.83% from 1971 to 2022 through August, compared with the S&amp;P 500’s risk-adjusted return of 0.71%. Not only do dividend stocks perform better during inflationary periods but these securities have also outpaced inflation historically. Over the past 150 years, dividends by US companies grew by 3.7% annually, compared with a 2% growth in inflation, according to a report by iShares. The report also highlighted that shares of the companies that initiated and grew their dividends in the last 40 years have outperformed non-dividend companies.Quality companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders are less volatile than their peers as they have strong balance sheets. Moreover, dividend growers have also delivered strong returns to shareholders in the past. VanEck referred to data by Morningstar in one of its reports, which showed that US dividend growth stocks fell by 10.07% from January to May this year, compared with a 12.76% decline in the S&amp;P 500.Dividend companies like Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are notable in this regard as they have been raising their dividends for a long time and also have sound financial health.Story continues11 Best Dividend Stocks Under $20Our Methodology:The companies mentioned below pay dividends to shareholders and have share prices below $20.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin disease most commonly affecting women and can result in painful ulcers and intense itching.Povorcitinib (INCB54707): In August, results from the randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating povorcitinib in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) were presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) 31st Congress. Based on the positive Phase 2 results, Incyte plans to initiate a Phase 3 study in HS by end of this year.Indication and statusruxolitinib cream1(JAK1/JAK2)AD: Phase 3 pediatric study (TRuE-AD3)Vitiligo: Phase 3 (TRuE-V1, TRuE-V2); approved by FDA; MAA under reviewLichen planus: Phase 2 in preparationLichen sclerosus: Phase 2 in preparationruxolitinib cream + UVB(JAK1/JAK2 + phototherapy)Vitiligo: Phase 2povorcitinib(JAK1)Hidradenitis suppurativa: Phase 2b; Phase 3 in preparationVitiligo: Phase 2Prurigo nodularis: Phase 21 Novartis’ rights for ruxolitinib outside of the United States under our Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis do not include topical administration.Acquisition of Villaris Therapeutics further complements dermatology portfolio: In October, Incyte announced an agreement to acquire Villaris Therapeutics, an asset-centric biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel antibody therapeutics for vitiligo. Its lead asset, auremolimab (VM6) is a novel, ultra-humanized anti-IL-15Rβ monoclonal antibody designed to target and deplete autoreactive resident memory T cells (TRM) that has demonstrated efficacy as a treatment for vitiligo in preclinical models. Incyte will receive exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize auremolimab for all uses, including in vitiligo and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. IND-enabling studies are currently underway, and clinical development for auremolimab is expected to begin in 2023. The agreement is subject to clearance by the U.S. antitrust authorities under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and will become effective as soon as this condition has been met.Discovery and early development – key highlightsIncyte’s portfolio of other earlier-stage clinical candidates is included below.ModalityCandidatesSmall moleculesINCB81776 (AXL/MER), INCB99280 (PD-L1), INCB99318 (PD-L1), INCB106385(A2A/A2B), INCB123667 (CDK2)Monoclonal antibodies1INCAGN1876 (GITR), INCAGN2385 (LAG-3), INCAGN2390 (TIM-3), INCA00186 (CD73)Bi-specific antibodiesINCA32459 (LAG-3xPD-1)21 Discovery collaboration with Agenus.2 Development in collaboration with MerusPartnered – key highlightsIndication and statusruxolitinib (JAK1/JAK2)1Acute and chronic GVHD: approved in Europe; J-NDA under reviewbaricitinib (JAK1/JAK2)2AD: Phase 3 (BREEZE-AD); approved in Europe and JapanSevere AA: Phase 3 (BRAVE-AA1, BRAVE-AA2); approved in the U.S., Europe andJapancapmatinib (MET)3NSCLC (with MET exon 14 skipping mutations): approved in the U.S., Europe andJapan1 Jakavi (ruxolitinib) licensed to Novartis ex-US.2 Worldwide rights to baricitinib licensed to Lilly: approved as Olumiant in multiple territories globally for certain patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis; approved as Olumiant in EU and Japan for certain patients with atopic dermatitis.3 Worldwide rights to capmatinib licensed to Novartis.2022 Third Quarter Financial ResultsThe financial measures presented in this press release for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared by the Company in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), unless otherwise identified as a Non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that Non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Incyte’s GAAP disclosures. Management uses such information internally and externally for establishing budgets, operating goals and financial planning purposes. These metrics are also used to manage the Company’s business and monitor performance. The Company adjusts, where appropriate, for expenses in order to reflect the Company’s core operations. The Company believes these adjustments are useful to investors by providing an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company’s core operations. The metrics have been adopted to align the Company with disclosures provided by industry peers.Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used in conjunction with and to supplement Incyte’s operating results as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in our industry.As changes in exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, Management believes the presentation of certain revenue results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand its operating results and evaluate its performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. The Company calculates constant currency by calculating current year results using prior year foreign currency exchange rates and generally refers to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange or being on a constant currency basis. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as the Company presents them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.Financial HighlightsFinancial Highlights(unaudited, in thousands, except per share amounts)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Total GAAP revenues$823,303$812,987$2,467,935$2,123,414Total GAAP operating income138,376235,410509,347475,043Total Non-GAAP operating income167,271293,148649,042659,019GAAP net income112,775181,739312,199384,730Non-GAAP net income133,795261,824483,015589,413GAAP basic EPS$0.51$0.82$1.41$1.75Non-GAAP basic EPS$0.60$1.19$2.18$2.68GAAP diluted EPS$0.50$0.82$1.40$1.73Non-GAAP diluted EPS$0.60$1.18$2.16$2.65Revenue DetailsRevenue Details(unaudited, in thousands)Three Months Ended September 30,%Change(asreported)%Change(constantcurrency)1Nine Months Ended September 30,%Change(asreported)%Change(constantcurrency)12022202120222021Net product revenues:Jakafi$619,595$547,37313%13%$1,761,732$1,542,13814%14%Iclusig25,92928,522(9%)6%78,22282,356(5%)6%Pemazyre23,41417,56233%41%60,42948,92424%38%Minjuvi5,932556967%1,143%14,8455562,570%2,916%Opzelura38,140—NMNM67,454—NMNMTotal net productrevenues713,010594,01320%21%1,982,6821,673,97418%20%Royalty revenues:Jakavi85,80894,655(9%)6%240,386242,295(1%)11%Olumiant20,37186,572(76%)(71%)98,689154,875(36%)(33%)Tabrecta4,1142,74750%NM11,1787,27054%NMTotal royalty revenues110,293183,974(40%)350,253404,440(13%)Total net product androyalty revenues823,303777,9876%2,332,9352,078,41412%Milestone andcontract revenues—35,000(100%)(100%)135,00045,000200%200%Total GAAP revenues$823,303$812,9871%$2,467,935$2,123,41416%NM = not meaningful1.Percentage change in constant currency is calculated using 2021 foreign exchange rates to recalculate 2022 results.Product and Royalty Revenues Product and royalty revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 increased over the prior year comparative period as a result of net product revenues increasing 20% year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in Jakafi and Opzelura net product revenues. Jakafi net product revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 increased 13% over the prior year comparative period, primarily driven by growth in patient demand across all indications. Jakavi and Olumiant royalties for the quarter were impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, while Olumiant royalties were also impacted by a decrease in net product sales of Olumiant for use as a treatment for COVID-19 and a one-time deduction related to securing intellectual property rights.Operating ExpensesOperating Expense Summary(unaudited, in thousands)Three Months Ended September 30,%ChangeNine Months Ended September 30,%Change2022202120222021GAAP cost of product revenues$54,584$39,86937%$147,834$107,11738%Non-GAAP cost of product revenues148,52133,96543%129,71589,86344%GAAP research and development384,007334,94515%1,084,576985,35210%Non-GAAP research anddevelopment2358,268308,67516%1,004,372901,17011%GAAP selling, general andadministrative266,460190,70440%729,321513,35842%Non-GAAP selling, general andadministrative3247,474168,05047%675,751443,88652%GAAP (gain) loss on change in fairvalue of acquisition-relatedcontingent consideration(21,893)2,910(852%)(12,198)13,068(193%)Non-GAAP (gain) loss on change in fairvalue of acquisition-relatedcontingent consideration4———%———%GAAP collaboration loss sharing1,7699,149(81%)9,05529,476(69%)1 Non-GAAP cost of product revenues excludes the amortization of licensed intellectual property for Iclusig relating to the acquisition of the European business of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the cost of stock-based compensation.2 Non-GAAP research and development expenses exclude the cost of stock-based compensation.3 Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses exclude the cost of stock-based compensation and legal settlements.4 Non-GAAP (gain) loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration is null.Research and development expenses GAAP and Non-GAAP research and development expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 increased 15% and 16%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to continued investment in our late stage development assets and certain upfront and milestone payments. Excluding the $33.5 million of upfront and milestone payments for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, GAAP and Non-GAAP research and development expense increased approximately 6% and 7%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2021.Selling, general and administrative expenses GAAP and Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 increased 40% and 47%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to expenses related to our dermatology commercial organization and activities to support the launch of Opzelura for the treatments of atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.Other Financial InformationOperating income GAAP operating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 decreased compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses partially offset by growth in net product revenues.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities position As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.0 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.2022 Financial GuidanceIncyte is tightening its full year 2022 guidance for Jakafi net product revenues to reflect strong performance of Jakafi and is revising the guidance range for other Hematology/Oncology net product revenues to reflect unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company is reaffirming its research and development guidance, which now also includes the upfront payment to Villaris, anticipated in the fourth quarter, and its selling, general and administrative expense guidance. Guidance does not include revenue from any potential new product launches or the impact of any potential future strategic transactions.

Several large drug and biotech stocks have announced third-quarter results so far. A few industry players like Merck, Biogen, Sanofi, Gilead beat on both earnings and sales, while others like AbbVie and Novartis reported mixed results.The Zacks classification shows the pharma/biotech industry to fall under the broader Medical sector, comprising pharma/biotech and generic companies, and medical device companies.As of Oct 26, the Earnings Trends report confirms that 23.2% of the Medical sector participants, constituting 43% of the sector’s market capitalization, already posted earnings. While 84.6% of the companies beat on earnings, 92.3% surpassed on revenues. Earnings decreased 1.8% year over year, while revenues rose 7.5%.Overall, third-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 8.3%, while sales are projected to increase 3.8%.Let's see how things have shaped up for Pfizer Inc.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Stryker The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.47bUS$3.79bUS$4.04bUS$4.47bUS$4.76bUS$5.00bUS$5.20bUS$5.38bUS$5.55bUS$5.70bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.38%Est @ 5.06%Est @ 4.14%Est @ 3.49%Est @ 3.04%Est @ 2.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.5kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.1kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$33bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.0%) = US$129bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$129b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$69bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$102b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$229, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Stryker as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.965. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Stryker, we've put together three essential aspects you should consider:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Stryker   (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.Future Earnings: How does SYK's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

This compares to earnings of $2.20 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -5.36%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this medical device maker would post earnings of $2.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.25, delivering a surprise of -0.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Stryker , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $4.48 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.16 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Stryker shares have lost about 14.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.2%.What's Next for Stryker?While Stryker has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Stryker: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.90 on $5.06 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.36 on $18.29 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the bottom 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.NanoString Technologies (NSTG), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 7.This maker of diagnostic systems for the analysis of genomic information is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +33.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.NanoString Technologies' revenues are expected to be $35.45 million, down 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Lobo, Chair and CEO. ""Worsening foreign currency and ongoing inflation, including premiums on spot buys for key components, pressured our adjusted earnings and will impact our full year results. We are taking additional actions to address these persistent issues.""Story continuesSales AnalysisConsolidated net sales of $4.5 billion increased 7.7% in the quarter and 11.4% in constant currency. Organic net sales increased 9.9% in the quarter including 10.6% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.7% from lower prices.MedSurg and Neurotechnology net sales of $2.6 billion increased 10.2% in the quarter and 13.5% in constant currency. Organic net sales increased 10.8% in the quarter including 9.8% from increased unit volume and 1.0% from higher prices.Orthopaedics and Spine net sales of $1.9 billion increased 4.4% in the quarter and 8.7% in constant currency. Organic net sales increased 8.7% in the quarter including 11.6% from increased unit volume partially offset by 2.9% from lower prices.Earnings AnalysisReported net earnings of $816 million increased 86.3% in the quarter. Reported net earnings per diluted share of $2.14 increased 87.7% in the quarter. Reported gross profit margin and reported operating income margin were 62.1% and 18.0% in the quarter. Reported net earnings include certain items, such as charges for acquisition and integration-related activities, the amortization of purchased intangible assets, asset write-offs and impairments and restructuring-related and other charges, costs to comply with certain medical device regulations, recall-related matters, regulatory and legal matters and tax matters. Excluding the aforementioned items, adjusted gross profit margin(1) was 62.6% in the quarter, and adjusted operating income margin(1) was 22.3% in the quarter. Adjusted net earnings(1) of $810 million decreased 3.8% in the quarter. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $2.12 decreased 3.6% in the quarter.2022 Outlook Considering our third quarter results, the strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in our implant and capital businesses, we now expect full year 2022 organic net sales growth(2) to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.0%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we now expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 4% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share(2) to be adversely impacted by approximately $0.35 to $0.40 in the full year. Based on our performance in the third quarter including consideration of continued inflationary pressures, together with our strong sales and additional cost reduction actions, and most significantly, the anticipated future impact of foreign currency, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share(2) in the range of $9.15 to $9.25 per share.(1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: gross profit margin, operating income and operating income margin, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, and other important information accompanies this press release.(2) We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of our expected net sales growth to expected organic net sales growth as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort the impact and timing of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of our expected net earnings per diluted share to expected adjusted net earnings per diluted share as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort the impact and timing of restructuring-related and other charges, acquisition-related expenses and fair value adjustments to inventory and the outcome of certain regulatory, legal and tax matters. The financial impact of these items is uncertain and is dependent on various factors, including timing, and could be material to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.Conference Call on Monday, October 31, 2022As previously announced, Stryker will host a conference call on Monday, October 31, 2022 at 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time, to discuss the Company's operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and provide an operational update.Please register for this conference call at: https://www.netroadshow.com/events/login?show=ef1f360c&amp;confId=40138.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: percentage sales growth; percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research, development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS); free cash flow; and free cash flow conversion. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. To measure free cash flow, we adjust cash provided by operating activities by the amount of purchases of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from long-lived asset disposals and remove the impact of certain legal settlements and recall payments. To measure free cash flow conversion we divide free cash flow by adjusted net earnings.Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.STRYKER CORPORATIONFor the Three and Nine Months September 30(Unaudited - Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial MeasuresThree Months 2022Gross ProfitSelling, General &amp;

As the US economy started to recover from its pandemic-driven recession, electricity sales grew 3.8% through August 2021 compared to the prior year. The electric power industry is undergoing decarbonization, digitalization, and decentralization. Heading into the last quarter of 2021, 46 out of 54 American investor-owned utility firms had pledged to lower carbon emissions, and many set a target of net zero carbon by 2050. In 2022, even more utilities jumped on board and reaffirmed commitments, driven by consumer support, chances for adding value, advanced environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets, growing clean energy mandates, and potential federal subsidies. The global utilities market grew from $5,488.88 billion in 2021 to $5,937.42 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2%. The utilities sector is forecasted to grow to $7,376.5 billion in 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 5.6%. The swift growth and significant investments in renewable power generation facilities is anticipated to support the advancement of the utilities industry during the forecast period. To benefit from the utilities sector, which is known for paying generous dividends, some of the best stocks include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), and Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D). Our Methodology We selected the following utility dividend stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and solidity of dividend profiles.

Approximately 70% of its revenue comes from Texas, where it owns one of the largest natural gas pipeline systems in the state.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Atmos Energy include:-Strong balance sheet and financial strength, perhaps most visible during 2021’s winter storm Uri when millions of Texans lost power. The significant spikes in natural gas prices stressed distributors, but Atmos handled over $2 billion of incremental costs with little long-term impact;-Experienced and shareholder-friendly management team, as demonstrated by 38 consecutive years of dividend increases; and-Attractive demographics and favorable regulatory environments in the states where it operates.Attractive ValuationGiven our estimates of higher normalized earnings and dividend payments, we believe shares of Atmos Energy are trading at a discount relative to our estimate of their intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Atmos Energy, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Old pipes and aging infrastructure, coupled with a growing population, have created a large backlog of safety and maintenance projects – completion of which should drive earnings growth and steady dividend increases. Updates should both increase reliability as well as the value of Atmos Energy’s assets, enhancing profit levels permitted by regulators;-Well positioned to source low-cost natural gas from prolific basins in Texas to its distribution network, helping to keep customer prices down and economically favorable relative to other sources of energy; and-Advantageous regulatory environment should continue to support rate adjustments so that revenues are earned on capital projects within six to 12 months.”7.

Sempra (NYSE:SRE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Dividend Yield as of October 28: 3.01%Sempra (NYSE:SRE), a California-based energy holding company specializing in electric services and natural gas, is one of the best dividend stocks to monitor.

(NYSE:D), Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is one of the best utility dividend stocks to buy according to elite hedge funds. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Value Strategy has to say about Sempra (NYSE:SRE) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Energy shortages in Europe were only intensified by the invasion. The conflict and economic sanctions against Russia have brought to the forefront EU dependence on Russian oil and natural gas. As Germany and its EU neighbors look to diversify their natural gas suppliers, some U.S. companies stand to benefit. Within the portfolio, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is well-positioned. Sempra’s previously underappreciated portfolio of infrastructure assets, with existing as well as prospective liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities, should benefit from renewed interest in U.S.-sourced LNG. The U.S. commitment to increase LNG exports to Europe over the coming years should create a favorable long-term demand environment and hopefully regulatory framework benefiting Sempra along with other natural gas and LNG suppliers. Sempra’s core utilities operations in California and Texas continue to generate solid mid- to high-single-digit earnings growth, and it enjoys additional growth opportunities from renewable natural gas (RNG), hydrogen and other renewable sources of energy.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Biggest Courier Companies in the World10 Most Successful Penny Stocks Ever12 Biggest Genomics Companies in the World Disclosure: None. 10 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

MLM is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5% and revenues (products and services) topped the same by 2.9%. On a year-over-year basis, earnings of this aggregates producer increased 3.9%. Products and services revenues rose 17.6%. Total quarterly revenues (including Product and Services and Freight revenues) were up 19.1% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Martin Marietta’s earnings topped the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters and missed on the other two occasions, with the average negative surprise being 8%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Martin Marietta’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.74 per share, suggesting a rise of 11.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $4.25. The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $1.67 billion, indicating a 14.2% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteMartin Marietta’s quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to have witnessed year-over-year growth in the third quarter, given the strong pricing gains in aggregates and strength in public construction. Improved visibility in residential and non-residential construction and contributions from acquisitions are also likely to have been the positives.Infrastructure construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and roads and streets, might have also contributed to its performance in the quarter, as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded. Also, resilient pricing may have been a tailwind.However, inflation from hydrocarbon, rising liquid asphalt and diesel fuel costs, more transportation costs and insurance and labor cost may have impacted the bottom line of Martin Marietta and its peers like Vulcan Materials Company VMC. Also, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs, supply and contract costs and supply-chain bottlenecks are added concerns.The business and earnings of MLM have been sensitive to changes in construction spending, particularly housing and public construction in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida as well as Iowa. Delayed federal spending is likely to have ailed revenues.Story continuesOther ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Building Material segment revenues (product and services), which comprise 95% of total revenues, is pegged at $1,603 million, implying 8.4% growth from a year ago.The consensus estimate for Magnesia Specialties revenues (product and services) is currently pegged at $71 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 1.4% from $72 million reported a year ago.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Martin Marietta this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Currently, MLM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -1.99%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.About VMCVulcan: The construction aggregates company’s focus on four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation — will enhance the price performance and operating efficiencies. Vulcan has been generating higher earnings despite tepid revenues due to prudent cost-control efforts and increased pricing in aggregates. Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives.VMC is likely to miss expectations when it reports third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of -3.07%.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are two companies in the Zacks Construction sector, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their respective quarters to be reported.Based in Winchester, VA, Trex Company, Inc. TREX — which manufactures and distributes decking, railing, and outdoor living products and accessories — topped earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 10.8%.TREX is poised to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 31, after market close. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +25.62%, at present.Continued investments by customers in enhancing their outdoor living experience are likely to have aided the company’s quarterly performance.

On a year-over-year basis, earnings dropped 2.5% but revenues increased 43.6%.Vulcan Materials’ earnings topped the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters and missed the same on the other two occasions, with the average surprise being 2.3%.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share has been revised downward to $1.71 from $1.76 over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates an increase of 11% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $2 billion, suggesting 31.8% year-over-year growth.Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company Price and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company price-eps-surprise | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteFactors to NoteThe slowing residential market, wet weather in Texas, rail freight bottlenecks and cement shortages are expected to reflect in third-quarter aggregates volumes of the companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM.Nonetheless, higher non-residential construction activities and incremental federal funding from the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act should have acted as a tailwind for third-quarter 2022. Also, resilient pricing — given the growth in all product lines — is expected to have supported growth for Vulcan.Higher spending from a number of states that it serves is likely to have aided revenues. The aggregates business (including crushed stone, sand, and gravel, along with other aggregates) has been a major contributor to revenue growth. Efforts to enhance operational excellence, acquisition synergies and cost-control measures are expected to have aided the bottom line to some extent.Vulcan Materials closed the previously announced acquisition of U.S. Concrete, thereby enhancing its aggregates-led business with additional geographic reach. U.S. Concrete is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Vulcan.Yet, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs and supply &amp; contract costs may have been risks. Inflation from hydrocarbons, rising liquid asphalt costs, insurance and labor might have added to the negatives. Along with higher energy prices, VMC's Mexican operations shutdown is added negative.Other ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales from the Aggregates segment (accounting for 72% of total revenues) is pegged at $1,371 million, indicating an increase from $1,172 million a year ago.The consensus mark for net sales from the Concrete segment (accounting for 13.8% of total revenues) is $470 million, suggesting a significant increase from $219 million a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales from the Asphalt Mix segment (14% of total revenues) is pegged at $270 million, indicating growth from $221 million a year ago.The consensus mark for the Calcium segment’s net sales is $1.60 million, suggesting an increase from $1.47 million a year ago.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Vulcan this time around. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.07%.

TREX has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.TREX’s earnings topped the consensus mark in all the last four quarters, with the average being 10.8%.

Keep These 7 Dividend Stocks Out of Your Retirement Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warning-keep-7-dividend-stocks-192048518.html,1666984848,STORY,"['VMC', 'HCSG', 'BIG', 'NCMI', 'HOG', 'JOAN']","[While high-yielding dividend stocks may provide the security investors want at this time, many of them could be dividend traps. These stocks come with high yields that are unlikely to be sustainable over the long term.There could also be a situation where a company may be paying more dividends than its net income. Though such a scenario may be possible when investor sentiment is high, these companies are likely to cut or suspend their dividends in the current downturn. Therefore, the return isn’t worth the investment. Having said that, let’s look at seven dividend stocks to avoid now.VMCVulcan Materials$165.48BIGBig Lots$18.04CWHCamping World$28.36HOGHarley-Davidson$43.07JOANJoann Inc.$5.34HCSGHealthcare Services Group$14.01NCMINational CineMedia$0.46Vulcan Materials (VMC)Source: ShutterstockOne of the stop dividend stocks to avoid now is Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), one of the biggest names in the U.S. construction industry. It is the country’s largest producer of construction aggregates such as gravel and crushed stone. VMC boasts a relatively strong track record of growing its sales and rewarding its shareholders in the process. However, its lofty valuation and the headwinds in the construction space make it an unattractive bet at this point. Moreover, its dividend yield of less than 1% is significantly lower than its peers, which trade at more attractive valuations.Perhaps the obvious knock-on VMC is the incredible slowdown in housing and non-residential construction. Interest rates have damped market expectations, and homebuilder confidence is far lower than it was several months ago. VMC’s bottom line has suffered immensely, with its costs rising at a relentless pace. Therefore, it’s tough to wager on VMC, given the headwinds it faces at this time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBig Lots (BIG)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockBig Lots (NYSE:BIG) saw its shares skyrocket during the pandemic years. Big-box retailers such as BIG got a tremendous boost from the pandemic-led tailwinds in 2020, which continued the following year. However, the economic situation has changed dramatically over the past several months. It’s another one of the top dividend stocks to avoid now. Record-high inflation rates have weighed down margins and demand. Profitability metrics for Big Lots are down in the doldrums, with its trailing twelve-month EBIT margin at a negative 0.5%. Conditions will only worsen for the retail sector, and the firm’s management will likely slash its dividend payout. Therefore, it’s one of the more risky dividend bets at this time.Story continuesCamping World (CWH)a couple has breakfast at a campsiteSource: ShutterstockCamping World (NYSE:CWH) is a leading recreational vehicle retailer with a healthy market share in the niche. It also provides RV-related services that have helped improve its margins and expand its revenue base. Its business has outperformed the market over the past several years, growing its top line by a tremendous 14% over a five-year period. Moreover, it also offers an eye-catching dividend yield of roughly 9%.Given the current economic conditions and the pandemic in the rear-view mirror, RV demand is likely to drop substantially in the coming months. In fact, according to a Baird report, recreational vehicle sales plummeted 19% in August. Moreover, RV wholesale shipments dropped 36% in the same month. With interest rates and gas prices rising rapidly over the past several months, the situation should only worsen from here.Harley-Davidson (HOG)A close-up photograph of the tank to a Harley-Davidson motorcycle with raindrops on it.Source: Alex Erofeenkov / Shutterstock.comHarley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) is one of the most popular American motorcycle businesses founded back in 1903. Though the company boasts incredible brand equity, its revenue growth has been in the negative over the past five years. Moreover, it’s entering a major rebranding period, which spells trouble for its investors. HOG recently spun off its LiveWire electric motorcycle division to kickstart its revamp. However, the process will take a lot of time, which points to negative earnings growth over the next few years. Also, its dividend profile isn’t the most impressive, considering its 5-year growth rate is at a negative 15.6%. Moreover, it faces troubling economic conditions, weakening its business further, and makes this list of dividend stocks to avoid now.Joann Inc. (JOAN)An array of fabric and textiles is arranged on a surface. The fabrics are of all colors; pinks, green, blues, yellows, and browns.Source: Anastasia Badmaeva / ShutterstockJoann Inc. (NASDAQ:JOAN) is a sewing and fabric supplies retailer that rode a wave of growth in the past couple of years. It benefitted from lockdown restrictions, boosting top-line growth leading up to its IPO last year. On the flip side, financial and operating performance over the past year pushed JOAN stock to new lows. The firm has suffered significantly from supply chain disruptions that have hit profitability and inventory availability. Moreover, higher import costs have resulted in massive pressures impacting the company’s profits and financial flexibility. Profitability metrics are firmly in the red, with return on common equity at a deplorable negative 59% in the past 12 months. Moreover, its debt is approximately 38 times its equity, which poses serious questions about its future outlook.Healthcare Services Group (HCSG)A person in silhouette faces toward a bright window while sitting at the edge of a hospital bed.Source: sfam_photo / Shutterstock.comHealthcare Services Group (NASDAQ:HCSG) provides housekeeping and dietary services to hospitals and nursing homes. Its business has struggled to grow sales over the past few years, with the pandemic further complicating its plight. Moreover, it is paying out a dividend that far exceeds earnings. Given the challenging economic climate, it’s tough to see how HCSG could maintain its payout.HCSG stock trades at a pricey multiple of over 38 times forward earnings despite its lackluster financial performance. Though its stock has dropped considerably of late, it still trades close to its historical multiples. Even if the firm mounts a comeback in the upcoming months, the discrepancy between its dividend payout and earnings will likely continue. Therefore, it’s best to avoid investing in the stock at this time.National CineMedia (NCMI)Source: ShutterstockNational CineMedia (NASDAQ:NCMI) is a troubled movie theater advertising business that is perhaps the best example of a dividend trap. Its business slumped during the pandemic, in line with its peers in the movie theatre industry. It was forced to slash its dividends, and since early 2020, its payout has decreased from 19 cents to just three cents at this time.Moreover, the firm is carrying over $800 million in outstanding debt, which its management is looking to restructure. Hence, it may have to slash its payout to zero to continue being solvent. Also, restructuring measures are likely to dilute shareholders.Though revenue growth has improved post-pandemic, NCMI needs a lot more inflows to get out of trouble. Its share price has tanked and now trades for just chump change. Additionally, streaming services face intense competition, which continues to chomp away at their market share.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

This compares to earnings of $1.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.82%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of $1.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.65, delivering a surprise of -38.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Cincinnati Financial , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, posted revenues of $2.08 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.12%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.86 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Cincinnati Financial shares have lost about 10% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.2%.What's Next for Cincinnati Financial?While Cincinnati Financial has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cincinnati Financial: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.56 on $2.09 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.36 on $8.02 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Property and Casualty is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, FNF Group (FNF), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 8.This provider of title insurance and mortgage services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.FNF Group's revenues are expected to be $3.22 billion, down 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Johnston, chairman and chief executive officer, commented: ""Investment income in the third quarter of 2022 continued to contribute to a positive operating profit. Steady cash flow from 10 consecutive years of underwriting profit helps fuel our investment approach, allowing us to continually invest new money in both the equity and fixed-maturity securities markets.""As previously announced, losses from Hurricane Ian pushed our third-quarter combined ratio to 103.9%. Confident in our balance sheet, we were able to focus on what was important: outstanding claims service. I applaud the efforts of our associates who worked quickly to comfort those who had experienced loss and get them moving toward recovery.""Our property casualty insurance business remains profitable for the year so far, recording a 99.2% combined ratio through the end of September, within our long-term goal of a 95% to 100% combined ratio.""For both the third quarter and first nine months of the year, our combined ratios before catastrophes rose compared to 2021's excellent results. These ratios, which filter out much of the effects of severe weather, continue to include increased uncertainty of estimated ultimate losses, due in part to elevated paid losses reflecting economic or other forms of inflation.""Tackling Inflation in Insurance ""Our sophisticated pricing models give us a robust view of the many factors impacting our business. We can examine these elements to clearly see the actions we need to take to address inflation.""When considering new or renewal business, our underwriters are focused on risk selection and pricing discipline. Our continued strong net written premium growth of 14% on both a quarterly and nine-month basis reflects our management of both exposure growth and net rate increases that factor in expected inflation effects. Premium growth also benefits from 162 new agency appointments so far this year and our efforts to gain a larger share of each agency's business.""In this inflationary environment, we must keep up with increases in the costs of building materials when pricing property coverage. For our homeowners business, we automatically apply an inflation factor on all renewal policies to adjust exposure amounts. On commercial property policies, we use third-party data to evaluate insurance to value for each account. For the third quarter, we averaged a commercial property premium increase effect roughly double what it was a year ago.""Looking at only the average amount of renewal price increases can mask the actual impact of segmentation and the fact that policies are priced on an account-by-account basis with some experiencing higher than average increases and some experiencing lower than average increases – based on the risk factors appropriate for that individual account. However, personal auto is one line of business where we see the need for rate increases nearly across the board. Inflation levels our industry hasn't experienced in decades, combined with increasingly distracted drivers, continue to push both severity and frequency of claims higher.""Confidence in the Future""Our confidence in our ongoing ability to produce value for our shareholders far into the future is unwavering. Our talented and dedicated associates are working vigorously with the independent agents who represent us to drive our multi-pronged strategy to continue growing our insurance business profitably.""Insurance Operations HighlightsConsolidated Property Casualty Insurance Results(Dollars in millions)Three months ended September 30,Nine months ended September 30,20222021% Change20222021% ChangeEarned premiums$ 1,809$ 1,59613$ 5,124$ 4,58512Fee revenues330880 Total revenues1,8121,599135,1324,59312Loss and loss expenses1,348988363,5442,74129Underwriting expenses53049081,5411,37712 Underwriting profit (loss)$ (66)$ 121nm$ 47$ 475(90)Ratios as a percent of earned premiums:Pt.

By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Cincinnati Financial's earnings per share are down 0.7% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.In contrast revenue growth of 11% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Cincinnati Financial is growing, a real positive. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. You can see what analysts are predicting for Cincinnati Financial in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Cincinnati Financial, it has a TSR of 62% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Cincinnati Financial shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 14% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 21%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Cincinnati Financial better, we need to consider many other factors.

432,979a7f83-1701-34c0-bbc9-05973c634b97,GE,2022-11-01,Investors Heavily Search General Electric Company (GE): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-general-electric-130001706.html,1667221201,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric (GE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this industrial conglomerate have returned +26.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5% change. The Zacks Diversified Operations industry, to which GE belongs, has gained 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, GE is expected to post earnings of $1.12 per share, indicating a change of +21.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.54 points to a change of +19.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -7.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.27 indicates a change of +68% from what GE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for GE.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of GE, the consensus sales estimate of $21.88 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.8%. The $75.86 billion and $81.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.3% and +7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGE reported revenues of $19.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.26%. The EPS surprise was -25.53%.Over the last four quarters, GE surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.GE is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(BRK.B), Chubb Ltd. CB, The Progressive Corp. PGR, W.R. Berkley Corp. WRB and ProAssurance Corp. PRA.Industry: Insurance - P&amp;CLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2008549/5-property-casualty-insurers-to-gain-despite-industry-challengesThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance (P&amp;C) industry is likely to benefit from better pricing, prudent underwriting and exposure growth. Industry players like Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Chubb Ltd., The Progressive Corp., W.R. Berkley Corp. and ProAssurance Corp. are poised to grow despite a rise in catastrophic activities. Given an active catastrophe environment, the policy renewal rate should accelerate. Also, the increasing adoption of technology and the emergence of insurtech will help in the smooth functioning of the industry players.Though the industry is witnessing a rate increase, the magnitude has decreased in the last seven quarters. Nonetheless, an improvement in surplus and accelerated economic activities set the stage for a better M&amp;A environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property insurance, and casualty insurance products and services. Such insurance helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man-made disasters. Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players.The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety. Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers.These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed has already made five hikes in 2022 with more to come. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. They implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Per Marsh, global commercial insurance prices in the third quarter of 2022 increased 16%, marking the 20th straight quarter of price increase.However, Marsh also stated that the magnitude has declined in the last seven quarters. Per Willis Towers Watson's 2022 Insurance Marketplace Realities report, rates will continue to rise but by a small margin.  Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte insights, global non-life premiums are estimated to grow 3.7% in 2022. Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The property and casualty insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profit. Per Colorado State University (CSU), the 2022 above-average hurricane season may have 19 named storms, including nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes. Per Swiss Re, the industry incurred global insured catastrophe losses of $38 billion in the first half of 2022.The third quarter largely suffered the wrath of Hurricane Ian, which weighed on the underwriting profitability of many industry players.  Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion. However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, optimistic growth outlook and sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — creating competition for incumbent players.The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry. Accelerated digitalization has become the need of the hour and insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. Per Deloitte Insights, the technology budget is projected to increase 13.7% in 2022. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term. The Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #163, which places it in the bottom 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The estimates have moved down 4.2% since February 2022.Before we present a few property and casualty stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Property and Casualty Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively risen 1.1% in the past year compared with the Finance sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's decline of 17.6% and 18.3%, respectively.Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.39X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.37X and the sector's 3.15X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.54X, as low as 1.18X and at the median of 1.36X.5 Property and Casualty Insurance Stocks to Keep an Eye onWe are recommending two Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks and one Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock from the P&amp;C Insurance industry.

If you want to jump ahead to the top five companies in this list, then take a look at 5 Biggest Gas Companies in the World.The Gas Industry: An AnalysisThe ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the global push toward clean energy have placed an even higher premium on natural gas. The fuel has multiple advantages over both renewable energy and crude oil. Natural gas is a clean burning fuel, which results in fewer emissions and it is also able to generate higher amounts of energy per kilogram.Globally, gas is being sold at a premium and prices touched record high earlier this year when they crossed $10 per MMBtu. The prices have almost halved since then, and the natural gas futures market, which bets on the prices of the commodity for the next month, are also significantly down year to date. Yet, the futures continue to trade at the higher end of their 52-week range, as the shock in prices that erupted this year continues to make its mark felt.As for the gas industry itself, it is still one of the largest in the world and according to the research firm The Business Research Company, the market was worth $840 billion last year. From then to the end of this year, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% to sit at $940 billion. Additionally, the firm goes on to add that from the end of 2022 to 2026, the market will grow at a 6.9% CAGR and be worth $1.23 trillion by the end of the forecast period.For our list for you today, we will take a look at the largest natural gas companies in the world, and among the publicly traded names, the ones likely to catch your eye are Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).Photo by Robin Sommer on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn order to sift out the largest natural gas companies in the world, we studied the revenue of the companies and then ranked them according to their net sales.

The firm is headquartered in San Ramon, California.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) raked in $162 of net sales in 2021, and the firm is believed to be one of the beneficiaries of the recent OPEC+ production cut. This is due to the fact that Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) might be allowed to produce oil in Venezuela as the U.S. government considers easing sanctions on the country to increase oil production.By the end of this year's second quarter, 59 out of the 895 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had invested in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s largest investor is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway which owns 161 million shares that are worth $23 billion.6.

Here is what the fund said:“We added one new position this quarter, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). TTE is one of the world’s largest energy companies. It develops and produces oil and gas, produces and sells refined products, is one of the largest producers and traders of LNG, and owns a large portfolio of renewable power generating assets. TTE has one of the lowest cost portfolios of oil and gas assets and therefore one of the lowest breakeven points in the industry. It also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. We estimate it will reach a net cash position sometime in 2023.The valuation of TTE—and that of Shell—is fascinating. TTE sells at approximately 4X earnings and has a 5% dividend yield. With its current buyback program and a recently announced special dividend, the owners yield is more than 10%. The valuation and owners yield are not dissimilar to those of Shell, which we also own and which trades at just under 5X earnings. To say that a discount is attached to European oil companies relative to US peers is an understatement. Exxon Mobil sells at 8X earnings, Chevron 9X and Conoco 8X. If TTE and Shell redomiciled to the US, their share prices would probably double.Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are met by TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in our list of the world's largest gas companies. Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Gas Companies in the World.  Suggested Articles:Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks To BuyWhat Are the Best Stocks To Buy Now?10 Most Undervalued Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 15 Biggest Gas Companies in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Valero Energy is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$13b ÷ (US$59b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Valero Energy has an ROCE of 31%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Valero Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Valero Energy here  for free.So How Is Valero Energy's ROCE Trending?Valero Energy's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 257% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Valero Energy's ROCETo sum it up, Valero Energy is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And with a respectable 96% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can also take a look at Top 5 Life Insurance Companies In The World.Life Insurance Industry: An AnalysisThe life insurance industry is a vital part of the financial services sector in the United States. It helps provide financial security for families in the event of the death of a breadwinner, and also offers a variety of other products and services to meet the needs of policyholders. The industry is highly competitive, with a large number of companies offering a variety of products. Life insurance companies must be licensed in every state in which they do business, and are subject to regulation by the state insurance commissioner. The life insurance industry has undergone a number of changes in recent years, including the introduction of new products, the consolidation of companies, and the emergence of new distribution channels.According to statistics from McKinsey, life insurance made up 45% of global premiums in 2019, up 4.4% from its share in 2018. Global life insurance gross premiums went up by 4% in 2019, in line with the growth rate in 2017 and 2018. Developing economies in the Asia Pacific region exhibited the fastest growth in the world, and grew by 10% in 2019. The pandemic drove the life insurance premiums growth in 2020 and 2021, however, growth attributed to the pandemic appears to be slowing down according to the 2023 insurance outlook by Deloitte. Deloitte analysts expect a minor contraction in global premiums growth in 2022, 0.2%, partly due to rising interest rates and surging inflation. However, Deloitte forecasts that global premiums growth will rebound in 2023 and record a 1.9% increase in the year across emerging markets as the inflation situation cools down and economic conditions improve. Deloitte expects life insurance premiums to fall across North America, Europe, and China in 2022. However, the firm sees emerging markets, excluding China, registering a positive growth print of 3.5% for premiums in 2022, led by India recording a 6% increase in life insurance premiums for the year.

But for the millions of kids who woke up this morning without access to the basics many of us take for granted, such as a toothbrush and toothpaste, it was their only option. Put simply, this is not how kids should have to brush their teeth. That’s why today, on National Brush Day, Crest and Oral-B are taking another step in the Brands’ efforts towards Closing America’s Smile Gap. For every product purchased during November, Crest and Oral-B will donate product to a kid that needs it the most1.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221101005541/en/This is not how kids should have to brush their teeth. Join Crest and Oral-B in #ClosingAmericasSmileGap""I’ve seen first-hand what lack of access to basic oral care needs does to kids – not just the physical pain, but the emotions from it due to lower confidence and missed opportunities,"" said Dr. Franklyn Aguebor, DMD and owner at Smile Design Dental Studio. ""It starts every day in their bathrooms without access to the basic tools, and spreads to their ability to access dental education, care and treatment. Raising awareness of the inequities and getting the basics into the hands of the kids that need them the most is a key first step. And consumers are helping every time they buy Crest and Oral-B products this month.""Kids not having simple basics like a toothbrush or toothpaste is part of a much bigger problem in America – kids in underserved communities just don’t get the oral care they need. This reality leaves the health of their smiles vulnerable, with some kids up to 4x more likely to have poor oral health than their peers2. The outcome? Millions of kids living with cavities and other preventable oral health issues that cause them to miss out on opportunities today, and tomorrow. At Crest and Oral-B, they call this The Smile Gap, and they are committed to closing it.Story continues""We believe every kid has the right to a healthy smile and the opportunities it brings, and are committed to tackling the issues and barriers that contribute to poor oral health in kids in underserved communities – access, education and representation,"" said Carlos De Jesus, Senior Vice President of Oral Care, North America at P&amp;G. ""Ensuring every kid in America has access to oral health basics like toothbrushes and toothpaste is a solvable problem, but reaching kids effectively isn’t as easy as it seems. Until the infrastructure is in place, Crest and Oral-B will continue to donate and make available the same products dentists use with their own families to every kid in need, every chance we can. We want to ensure every kid gets a fair chance of a healthy smile today, so their tomorrow isn’t at risk.""With a goal to Close America’s Smile Gap by providing oral care to 20 million smiles in need by 2030, Crest and Oral-B have been hosting local community events over the past year in partnership with charitable organizations, retailers and hundreds of thousands of dental professionals nationwide. Each community event offers dental education for kids and adults, dental care and screenings, and dental care products for kids in underserved communities.As part of their efforts to raise awareness of the ‘Smile Gap’, Crest and Oral-B have released a new provocative creative campaign to coincide with National Brush Day – a day focused on the importance of kids brushing their teeth, which is hard to do if you don’t have the tools you need. The campaign highlights the harsh reality kids without access to the basics like a toothbrush and toothpaste endure every day. The goal is to disrupt people’s complacency on the issue of underserved kids not getting the oral care they need.

""I'm thoroughly enjoying working with him. And as far as he tells me, he's enjoying working with me.""Peltz joined the board of the consumer products giant in May.Investors are banking on Peltz to push through a turnaround of the lumbering Unilever, maker of everything from Hellman's mayonnaise to Vaseline. Peltz has the track record in consumer products to do so: he was an instrumental figure in reorganizing P&amp;G as a then member of that board. The company restructured its divisions, cut costs and has since gone onto a product innovation boom.P&amp;G stock has been a top-performer the past five years, up 56%.Peltz also worked closely with now former P&amp;G CEO David Taylor, who ended up praising Peltz's work after a contentious proxy fight.As for long-time Unilever exec Jope, he said in late September that he plans to retire at the end of 2023. The decision comes amid a lagging stock price for Unilever since he took over in 2019, several mixed quarters, and calls by Wall Street to cut costs and divest assets.Jope told Yahoo Finance that he will still retire next year despite getting along well with Peltz, adding that investors shouldn't expect a major operational overhaul on his watch.""We've been busy on portfolio change,"" Jope said. ""We've committed to the market that we are not undertaking a major portfolio change for the foreseeable future. And our board is unanimously aligned behind the strategy that we've laid out in our last couple of earnings quarters and we will again in our Capital Markets Day. So please don't be expecting any surprises from Unilever. We've got five wonderful divisions, a business that's capable of delivering high-quality growth, and that, as you'll see from our performance and our share price, is rather resilient through the types of downturn that the world is going into right now.""Story continuesHellmann's, a brand of Unilever, is seen on display in a store in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., March 24, 2022.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $409.21 million.

Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Vornado: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of certain real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because they exclude the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. The Company also uses FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of period to period FFO, as one of several criteria to determine performance-based compensation for members of its senior management. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions are provided on the following page.

452,fbf9e6e4-5634-3dde-9b37-154d0f5ed196,PFG,2022-11-01,Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $0.64,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/principal-financial-group-nasdaq-pfg-100729287.html,1667297249,STORY,['PFG'],"[The board of Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 19th of December, with investors receiving $0.64 per share. This means the annual payment is 2.9% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Principal Financial Group's stock price has increased by 33% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield. View our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Principal Financial Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Principal Financial Group was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.EPS is set to fall by 53.2% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 34%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendPrincipal Financial Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.72 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.56. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Principal Financial Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 31% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.Story continuesWe Really Like Principal Financial Group's DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for Principal Financial Group you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning.

Dyslexia? Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder? Autism spectrum disorder? Maybe even social anxiety?All those conditions-and more-fall under the broad umbrella of neurodiversity. While not an official medical designation, neurodiversity refers to unique brain development and functions that, in turn, create different strengths. Up to 20% of the world's population has some form of neurodiversity: 10% are dyslexic, 5% have ADHD, and up to 2% are on the autism spectrum.For some neurodiverse individuals, the traditional pieces of finding and keeping a job-interviews, team meetings, and social gatherings, for example-may present obstacles. Fortunately, employers of today, including Principal®, have begun to realize that an inclusivity lens needs to include neurodiversity. At Principal, that's led to a creative hiring program focused on finding talent and offering individuals work that's rewarding. ""But equally as important, it's about challenging our assumptions, widening the lens of what inclusivity means, and continuing to strengthen our culture,"" says Joe Fiderlick, assistant director of engineering for Principal Asset ManagementSM.Expanding inclusion: Good for people, good for businessA few years ago, Jennifer Schwartz and Luke Heideman learned about a neurodiverse hiring program at another financial firm. Both Schwartz and Heideman are members of the OneAbility employee resource group at Principal, and the tenets of that setup were intriguing. ""There's always been a tight labor market for tech talent, and neurodiverse individuals have tended to be unemployed or underemployed,"" says Schwartz, a human resources business partner at Principal.Broadening both the talent lens and the umbrella of inclusivity also reminded the duo of another Principal program. ""The pipeline we have for veterans has done well,"" Heideman says; he's an audit manager with Principal. ""We saw the potential for two things with neurodiverse hiring: It was the right thing to do, and it could really make a business impact.""Story continuesArmed with best practices and possible programming, OneAbility collaborated with the Global Inclusion Team and Principal Asset Management to implement a neurodiversity hiring program in mid-2022. CAI, a vendor that specializes in finding and supporting neurodiverse people, interviews and onboards talent; the goal, says Schwartz, is to fill a current need and develop a talent pipeline for full-time Principal employees.Building teams and boosting cultureThe first program placements work on Fiderlick's team, and he calls himself fortunate to be part of the opportunity. ""It's exciting to widen the composition of my team. We need to continue to expand and reinforce our culture, while balancing that with making decisions that are best for our business,"" he says. ""We need to think broadly to set ourselves up for success.""For Fiderlick and team, that includes intentional conversations about communication, workplace needs, transitions, and calculating impact. For example, a person with sensory sensitivities may, on day one, need a work environment where lights can be adjusted or the ability to wear headphones to block noise. ""We need to measure if Principal is getting benefit from the engagement, but also whether the individuals hired feel like they are a valued part of a team and doing work that's meaningful,"" Fiderlick says.So far, so good, he says: ""The speed at which the team has demonstrated value and the support they have received from both the U.S. and international staff is a positive testament that we're on the right track.""Beyond successfully onboarding and transitioning employees are goals of expanding the program and challenging preconceived notions of skill sets. What if abilities initially pegged as limitations-pattern detection, for example-were actually strengths?""There's an opportunity for businesses to rethink and recalibrate how they think about staffing, particularly in challenging times, in ways that have meaningful and real benefits for everyone,"" Fiderlick says. ""There's a stigma behind being neurodiverse and programs like this start to change that narrative, transform culture, and help businesses and individuals take meaningful steps forward together.""Interested in a career with a diverse, inclusive team?

Net earnings were $1.6 billion, or $2.53 per diluted share, compared with $888 million, or $1.32 per diluted share a year ago, reflecting a release of $695 million in deferred taxes in the third quarter.Net earnings in the third quarter of 2022 included net investment gains of $199 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net investment losses of $171 million, or $0.25 per diluted share a year ago. The net investment gains were driven by net gains from certain derivatives and foreign currency activities of $173 million and net gains from sales and redemptions of $59 million, both driven by foreign exchange. These net investment gains included a decrease of $22 million in the fair value of equity securities. These gains were partially offset by an increase in the allowance associated with the company's estimate of current expected credit losses (CECL) and impairments of $11 million.Adjusted earnings* in the third quarter were $725 million, compared with $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2021, reflecting a decrease of 29.7%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share* decreased 24.8% to $1.15 in the quarter. Adjusted earnings included a variable investment income loss of $40 million from alternative investments, which was $0.11 per share below return expectations. Additionally, adjusted earnings reflects $70 million, or $0.11 per share, of net investment income for a make-whole call of a security in the Japan segment.  The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate impacted adjusted earnings per share by $0.08.The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the third quarter of 2022 was 137.08, or 19.7% weaker than the average rate of 110.11 in the third quarter of 2021. For the first nine months, the average exchange rate was 126.65, or 14.3% weaker than the rate of 108.58 a year ago.Story continuesTotal investments and cash at the end of September 2022 were $114.5 billion, compared with $146.0 billion at September 30, 2021. The decline in the portfolio is principally driven by the weaker yen and higher interest rates.Shareholders' equity was $24.2 billion, or $38.71 per share, at September 30, 2022, compared with $33.6 billion, or $50.62 per share, at September 30, 2021. Shareholders' equity at the end of the third quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $1.1 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain of $9.7 billion at September 30, 2021. Shareholders' equity at the end of the third quarter also included an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $4.5 billion, compared with an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $1.8 billion at September 30, 2021. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the third quarter was 25.3%.For the first nine months of 2022, total revenues were down 7.1% to $15.5 billion, compared with $16.7 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Net earnings were $4.0 billion, or $6.25 per diluted share, compared with $3.3 billion, or $4.82 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2021. Adjusted earnings for the first nine months of 2022 were $2.6 billion, or $4.03 per diluted share, compared with $3.2 billion, or $4.65 per diluted share, in 2021. Excluding the negative impact of $0.23 per share from the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate, adjusted earnings per diluted share decreased 8.4% to $4.26 for the first nine months of 2022.Shareholders' equity excluding AOCI (or adjusted book value*) was $27.7 billion, or $44.34 per share at September 30, 2022, compared with $25.9 billion, or $39.06 per share, at September 30, 2021. The annualized adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact* in the third quarter was 11.4%.AFLAC JAPANIn yen terms, Aflac Japan's net earned premiums were ¥309.9 billion for the quarter, or 4.1% lower than a year ago, mainly due to limited pay products reaching paid-up status and constrained sales from the impact of pandemic conditions. Adjusted net investment income increased 9.8% to ¥92.2 billion, mainly due to a weaker yen on the dollar-denominated investment income. Total adjusted revenues in yen declined 1.2% to ¥403.3 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings in yen for the quarter declined 19.2% on a reported basis to ¥86.9 billion, primarily due to a 940 basis point increase in the benefit ratio resulting from a wider scope of ""deemed hospitalization"" that was in effect through most of the third quarter. Pretax adjusted earnings decreased 27.9% on a currency-neutral basis. The pretax adjusted profit margin for the Japan segment decreased to 21.6%, compared with 26.3% a year ago.For the first nine months, net earned premiums in yen were ¥939.5 billion, or 4.2% lower than a year ago. Adjusted net investment income increased 8.1% to ¥265.3 billion. Total adjusted revenues in yen were down 1.7% to ¥1.2 trillion. Pretax adjusted earnings were ¥298.8 billion, or 4.0% lower than a year ago.In dollar terms, net earned premiums decreased 23.6% to $2.2 billion in the third quarter. Adjusted net investment income decreased 13.1% to $663 million. Total adjusted revenues declined by 21.4% to $2.9 billion.

Adjusted net investment income decreased 8.6% to $2.1 billion. Total adjusted revenues were down 16.4% to $9.5 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $2.4 billion, or 18.0% lower than a year ago.For the quarter, total new annualized premium sales (sales) increased 10.2% to ¥13.9 billion, or $100 million, reflecting the  August launch of a new cancer product through the agency channel. For the first nine months, total new sales decreased 4.1% to ¥38.5 billion, or $301 million.AFLAC U.S.Aflac U.S. net earned premiums declined 1.3% to $1.4 billion in the third quarter, impacted by lower year-to-date persistency. Adjusted net investment income decreased 3.1% to $185 million. Total adjusted revenues were down 1.1% to $1.6 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $309 million, 13.7% lower than a year ago, which was driven by elevated general expenses reflecting, in part, platform and growth investments, as well as the amortization of deferred acquisition costs driven by a slight drop in persistency. The pretax adjusted profit margin for the U.S. segment was 19.3%, compared with 22.2% a year ago.For the first nine months, net earned premiums declined 1.0% to $4.2 billion. Adjusted net investment income increased 1.1% to $563 million. Total adjusted revenues were down 0.1% to $4.9 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $984 million, or 19.1% lower than a year ago.Aflac U.S. sales increased 11.8% in the quarter to $334 million, reflecting continued improvement from investment in growth initiatives as well as productivity gains. For the first nine months of the year, total new sales increased 15.2% to $938 million.CORPORATE AND OTHER For the quarter, total adjusted revenues increased 1.4% to $73 million, primarily due to higher adjusted net investment income from higher interest rates and an increase in amortized hedge income, partially offset by higher tax credits expense and a reduction in total premiums as a result of significant yen weakening. Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $59 million, compared with a loss of $41 million a year ago, resulting from higher other adjusted expenses, interest expense, and benefits and claims (including the impact from ""deemed hospitalization"" benefits), partially offset by slightly higher total adjusted revenue.For the first nine months, total adjusted revenues decreased 7.8% to $189 million. Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $179 million, compared with a loss of $144 million a year ago.DIVIDEND AND CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERSThe board of directors declared the fourth quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, payable on December 1, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2022.In the third quarter, Aflac Incorporated deployed $650 million in capital to repurchase 11.1 million of its common shares. At the end of September 2022, the company had 25.6 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.OUTLOOK Commenting on the company's results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: ""The company generated solid earnings for the first nine months, despite the weakening yen. Pandemic conditions in Japan and the U.S. continued to move toward normalcy, contributing to positive sales growth in both segments in the third quarter and momentum into the fourth quarter.""Looking at our operations in Japan, sales continued to improve in the quarter with the launch of our new cancer insurance product through agencies in August, generating an increase of 10.2%. Persistency remained strong in the third quarter. We continue to monitor evolving pandemic conditions, as this impacts our ability to meet face-to-face with customers, which continues to be key to a recovery in sales. We believe our benefit ratio will normalize in the fourth quarter given the narrowed scope for ""deemed hospitalization"" introduced toward the end of the third quarter. Taking these factors into account, we continue to expect stronger sales in the fourth quarter, assuming that productivity continues to improve at Japan Post and that we execute on our product introduction and refreshment plans.""In the U.S., I am encouraged by the continued improvement in the productivity of our agents and brokers as we enter what is typically our strongest quarter of the year. This led to a strong third quarter that produced an 11.8% increase in sales. We continue to work toward reinforcing our leading position and generating stronger sales for the fourth quarter.""As always, we are committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We continue to generate strong investment results while remaining in a defensive position as we monitor evolving economic conditions. In addition, we have taken proactive steps in recent years to defend cash flow and deployable capital against a weakening yen. With the fourth quarter's declaration, 2022 will mark the 40th consecutive year of dividend increases. We treasure our track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we remain in the market repurchasing shares with a tactical approach, focused on integrating the growth investments we have made in our platform to improve our strength and leadership position.""*See Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures section for an explanation of foreign exchange and its impact on the financial statements and definitions of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release, as well as a reconciliation of such non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.ABOUT AFLAC INCORPORATEDAflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL) is a Fortune 500 company helping provide protection to more than 50 million people through its subsidiaries in Japan and the U.S., paying cash fast when policyholders get sick or injured.

The financial measures exclude items that the Company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations.Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. A significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, which results in foreign currency impact to earnings, cash flows and book value on a U.S. GAAP basis. Management evaluates the Company's financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts and the currency-neutral operating performance over time. The average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).The company defines the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release as follows:Adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. Adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are the adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. The adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside management's control. Adjusted revenues are U.S. GAAP total revenues excluding adjusted net investment gains and losses. Adjusted expenses are U.S. GAAP total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any nonrecurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the Company's insurance operations and that do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these financial measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company's insurance business. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.Adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior-year period, which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by foreign currency exchange rate changes. Adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact important because a significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in Japan and foreign exchange rates are outside management's control; therefore, the Company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating foreign currency (primarily Japanese yen) into U.S. dollars. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.Adjusted return on equity is adjusted earnings divided by average shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Management uses adjusted return on equity to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of this financial measure is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company's insurance business. The Company considers adjusted return on equity important as it excludes components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity is return on average equity (ROE) as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders' equity.Adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding the current period foreign currency impact divided by average shareholders' equity, excluding AOCI. The Company considers adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact important as it excludes changes in foreign currency and components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is ROE as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders' equity.Amortized hedge costs/income represent costs/income incurred or recognized as a result of using foreign currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign exchange risks in the Company's Japan segment or in Corporate and other. These amortized hedge costs/ income are estimated at the inception of the derivatives based on the specific terms of each contract and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. The Company believes that amortized hedge costs/income measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. There is no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for amortized hedge costs/ income.Adjusted book value is the U.S. GAAP book value (representing total shareholders' equity), less AOCI as recorded on the U.S. GAAP balance sheet. Adjusted book value per common share is adjusted book value at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share important as they exclude AOCI, which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses. Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses, and its related per share financial measure, important as they exclude certain components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control; however, it includes the impact of foreign currency as a result of the significance of Aflac's Japan operation. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses and adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.Adjusted net investment income is net investment income adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, and ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are reclassified from net investment gains and losses to net investment income. The Company considers adjusted net investment income important because it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the costs and income associated with the Company's investments and related hedging strategies. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment income is net investment income.Adjusted net investment gains and losses are net investment gains and losses adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are both reclassified to net investment income, and iii) the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable, which is reclassified to interest expense as a component of total adjusted expenses. The Company considers adjusted net investment gains and losses important as it represents the remainder amount that is considered outside management's control, while excluding the components that are within management's control and are accordingly reclassified to net investment income and interest expense. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment gains and losses is net investment gains and losses. RECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS(UNAUDITED – IN

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Boring Stocks That Make Money.Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) are a few of the most boring stocks in the world that should nonetheless entice investors thanks to their penchant for making money.Finding boring and dull stocks to invest in may not be the most exciting proposition in the world, but it’s integral to building a balanced portfolio that will perform well during even the most challenging market conditions. Such a scenario is upon us now, with investors increasingly turning to stable, boring stocks to fill out their portfolios as opposed to ones with greater long-term growth potential.What constitutes a boring stock is likely different for every investor, but some of the most common criteria include stocks that have a low beta, or volatility, which means they tend to avoid wild valuation swings. While that may be boring for day traders looking to profit from such swings with well-timed trades, investors looking to build a portfolio with an eye on steady long-term growth could do a lot worse than filling it with boring stocks.Low growth rates are another element of boring stocks that can make them unappealing to the masses. Barring some incredible fortune, there’s simply no means by which most boring stocks will ever compound at a significant rate over the long-term. Many of these companies have stable cash generating businesses, but their prospects for growth are minimal.Nonetheless, low volatility stocks frequently outperform their higher volatility brethren over the long-term, as they did between 1990 and 2011. Interestingly, the research that uncovered those results pointed to money managers as being one of the culprits. In their drive to beat market benchmarks, money managers frequently load up on riskier stocks that they hope will outperform, driving up their valuations. Likewise, the avoidance of low-growth, boring companies by those same money managers somewhat suppresses their own valuations.Story continuesIn the following list, we’ll take a look at ten boring stocks, all of which have generated at least $100 million in trailing twelve month net income, and many of which have generated billions. We’ll analyze why these stocks are boring, but why that also makes them intriguing long-term investments.10 Boring Stocks That Make Money 360b/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe following boring, money-making stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Boring Stocks That Make Money10. American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $1.3 billion Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) are some of the most boring stocks on the market that also happen to make a lot of money. Another is American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK), which pulled in $1.3 billion in net income over the trailing 12-month period.With a beta of 0.5 and relatively slow revenue and income growth, American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) is a pretty boring stock compared to some of the high-flying stocks out there. The utilities company did surge its EPS by more than $3.00 in 2021 however, hitting $6.96. Also of note is the company’s acquisition spree, with 30 agreements in place as of the end of Q2, which comes hot on the heels of 23 acquisitions being completed last year.Hedge funds have largely been maintaining their stakes in American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK) for the past five years, with little overall movement in ownership of the stock. Ian SImm’s Impax Asset Management owns by far the largest stake in the company among the fund’s tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 4.91 million shares of AWK as of June 30.9. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 33 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $2.07 billion If a company that leases public storage units sounds likely to be a boring stock, well it is. But Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a boring stock that’s earned an impressive $2.07 billion in net income over the trailing 12 month period. With a 0.38 beta, it’s a stock that’s not likely to do a whole lot one way or the other barring major news, but the company did have a strong 2021 after multiple years of slower growth. Revenue grew by more than 17% to $3.42 billion, while EPS grew by more than 50% to $9.91.Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) has become a lot more popular among hedge funds over the past year, with the stock hovering around all-time highs in terms of smart money ownership. The company boasts several major industry players as bulls, including Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management and Jeffrey Furber’s AEW Capital Management.The Baron Real Estate Income Fund is bullish on Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)’s leading position in many of its top markets, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Following strong performance in the first quarter of 2022, the shares of Public Storage Incorporated, a REIT that is the world’s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, declined 21% in the second quarter (a similar decline to most other REITs). We remain optimistic about the company’s long-term prospects. Public Storage’s nearly 2,500 self-storage facilities across the U.S. serve more than one million customers. The company has achieved the #1 market position in 14 of its top 15 markets.We are encouraged about the company’s prospects due to our expectations for the continuation of strong occupancy and rent trends, limited new supply, mid-teens organic cash flow growth, the potential for mergers and acquisitions activity in part due to the company’s well-capitalized and low leverage balance sheet, and the ability to increase rents monthly to combat inflation headwinds. We believe Public Storage’s shares are currently valued at a discount to private market self-storage values and offer prospects for mid-teens total returns in the next few years.”8. Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 37 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $113 million Food distributors like Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) aren’t going to set the world on fire, but the company’s on a nice little run right now, with $113 million in trailing 12 month net income and exceptional revenue growth of 67% during its latest fiscal year ended June 30, hitting $50.9 billion thanks to a strong year-over-year rebound for restaurants. That trend appears to have continued in Q3, though the company’s FY23 revenue growth is expected to be no greater than 13.9% against the tougher comps.Hedge fund ownership of Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) jumped by 28% during the second quarter as several hedge funds took notice of the company. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group owns 3.58 million PFGC shares as of June 30, adding a net total of 90,946 shares to its portfolio during Q2.The ClearBridge Investments Select Strategy, which owns 5.42 million Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) shares as of June 30, discussed the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“Performance Food Group is another example of a quality franchise bought during a depressing period for the foodservice industry that has flexed its balance sheet to make acquisitions of weaker players and continues to consolidate its leading market share.”7. Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 39 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $264 million Lithium company Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) has some strong secular tailwinds at its back that make for a somewhat exciting stock, though its past few years of results have been dull at best. The company’s revenue fell slightly between 2018 and 2021, while its EPS crated from more than $6 to just above $1. Those metrics are improving substantially this year however, with the company trending towards record figures across the board.Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) hit an all-time high in hedge fund ownership at the end of 2021, but there was a 20% drop in ownership during the first half of this year. Jay Chen’s Himension Capital owned 383,348 ALB shares on June 30, giving its 8.95% 13F exposure to the stock.Carillon Tower Advisers is bullish on Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)’s opportunity in the electric vehicle space, as the fund discussed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a global specialty chemicals company with leading positions in lithium, bromine, and refining catalysts. The company’s shares outperformed meaningfully in the quarter, driven largely by robust demand for lithium used to manufacture electric vehicle batteries. Albemarle is well-positioned for the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and could benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act.”6. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 45 Trailing 12 Month Net Income: $6.76 billion Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) has been about as stable and boring as a stock can get, with trailing 12 month revenue that’s essentially flat from 2018 levels and operating income that’s declined during that time. But the company makes boatloads of money, with more than $6 billion in net income in 2018, 2019, and 2021. It’s also in the midst of a banner year, with Q3 revenue jumping by 21% year-over-year and EPS surging by 46% and crushing estimates. Heck, with growth rates like that, Caterpillar might just be capable of creeping off the most boring stocks list some day.There was a 16% dip in hedge fund ownership of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) during Q2, as hedge funds timed their exits from the stock near its peak. CAT shares would subsequently fall by 29% between June 8 and September 27, but have railed over the last month. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital owns over 1.9 million shares of Caterpillar as of June 30.The Diamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund added Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) to its portfolio during Q1, laying out some of the reasons why in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) are more yawn-inducing stocks that make lots of money.

""Building the first phase of MPWSP will protect the Carmel River ecosystem and create a drought-proof new water supply for our service area.""The MPWSP boasts many of the same attributes as a recently approved desalination project in Southern California, including extensive public engagement, state-of-the art technology and reduced impact to the coastline.

462,4af23fb4-b703-3243-98b9-26a4f559d8c5,AWK,2022-11-01,American Water Works (AWK) Tops Q3 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-water-works-awk-tops-215509403.html,1667253309,STORY,['AWK'],"[American Water Works (AWK) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.63 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.53 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.40%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this water utility would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.20, delivering a surprise of 5.26%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.American Water Works , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry, posted revenues of $1.08 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.09 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.American Water Works shares have lost about 22.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -18.2%.What's Next for American Water Works?While American Water Works has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for American Water Works: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.87 on $893.38 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.44 on $3.69 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Water Supply is currently in the bottom 21% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

The Company’s earnings forecasts and targets are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those described under ""Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements"" below and under ""Risk Factors"" in its annual, quarterly, and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). All statements related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share.Targets EstablishedFinancial2023 earnings guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82 per shareLong-term EPS compound annual growth rate (""CAGR"") of 7-9% unchangedLong-term dividend growth expectation of 7-9%, narrowed to align with long-term EPS CAGR2023-2027 capital investment plan increased to $14-$15 billion and $30-$34 billion for the 10-year period of 2023-2032EnvironmentalBy 2035, reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 50% (2020 baseline)Achieve net zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050First time disclosure of scope 3 emissions estimated at 506,000 metric tons in 2021Consolidated ResultsFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, earnings per share were $1.63 and $3.70, respectively, compared to $1.53 and $3.40 per share in the same periods in 2021. These increases were primarily driven by the implementation of new rates in the Regulated Businesses for the recovery of capital and acquisition investments, offset somewhat by impacts from inflationary pressures on production costs and higher interest costs. Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, also reflect the favorable impact of weather, estimated at $0.06 per share, primarily due to hot and dry weather in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to a $0.01 per share unfavorable impact and $0.02 per share favorable impact for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Also, included in the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, are $0.06 and $0.18 per share, respectively, from interest income earned on the seller note and income earned on revenue share agreements, which compares to Homeowner Services Group (""HOS"") operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, of $0.09 and $0.25 per share, respectively. Results for 2021 included $0.09 and $0.10 per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, related to the operating results of the New York subsidiary (which was sold in January 2022).The Company is on track to meet its capital investment plan for the year with investments of $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2022, including $1.6 billion for infrastructure improvements and replacements in the Regulated Businesses. The Company plans to invest a total of approximately $2.5 billion across its footprint in 2022.Regulated BusinessesIn the third quarter of 2022, Regulated Businesses’ net income was $302 million, compared to $273 million for the same period in 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, Regulated Businesses’ net income was $681 million, compared to $623 million for the same period in 2021. Net income attributable to the Company’s New York subsidiary was $16 million and $17 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.Operating revenues increased $104 million and $187 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, as compared to 2021, when excluding revenues contributed by the Company’s New York subsidiary in 2021. The increases in operating revenues were primarily a result of authorized revenue increases resulting from completed general rate cases and infrastructure proceedings to recover incremental capital and acquisition investments.To date, the Company has been authorized additional annualized revenues of approximately $111 million from general rate cases in 2022. Further, approximately $82 million of additional annualized revenues from infrastructure surcharges have been authorized and are effective in 2022. The Company has general rate cases in progress in five jurisdictions, two of which have settlements filed and are awaiting final approval, and has filed for infrastructure surcharges in two jurisdictions, reflecting a total annualized revenue request of approximately $479 million.Excluding impacts of the Company’s New York subsidiary in 2021, operation and maintenance (""O&amp;M"") expenses were higher by $29 million and $44 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, as compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in production costs from inflationary pressures. Also, depreciation expense was higher by $10 million and $24 million in these same periods due to the growing capital investment.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, results included revenues of $45 million and $97 million, respectively, and operating expenses of $22 million and $71 million, respectively, for the Company’s New York subsidiary that was sold on January 1, 2022.Market-Based Businesses and OtherIn the third quarter of 2022, the net loss in Market-Based Businesses and Other was $5 million, compared to net income of $5 million for the same period in 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, the net loss in Market-Based Businesses and Other was $8 million, compared to net loss of $5 million for the same period in 2021. The primary driver for the change in both periods is the loss of earnings from HOS operations as a result of the sale of the business in 2021 and incremental interest expense on long-term debt in 2022. The loss of HOS operating results has been partially offset in both periods of 2022 with interest income earned on the seller note from the sale and continuing income earned on revenue share agreements. Year-to-date results in 2022 also reflect a net benefit of $0.06 per share from post-close adjustments from the sale of HOS and the Company’s New York subsidiary.DividendsOn October 27, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.6550 per share of common stock, payable on December 1, 2022, to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2022.2022 Third Quarter Earnings &amp; 2023 Earnings and Long-Term Guidance Conference CallThe conference call to discuss third quarter 2022 earnings, 2023 earnings guidance, and long-term targets will take place on Tuesday, November 1, 2022, at 9 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the ESG investing dynamics and challenges in the industry, you can go directly to read Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022. Over the past few years the concept of ESG has evolved dramatically. Environmental, Social, and Governance principles no longer belong to the vague realm of fancy words but rather play a key role in investing circles. Environmentally-conscious investors and activist hedge funds now pay serious attention to ESG metrics of companies before making investment decisions. Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.Regulatory pressure from governments around the world is also causing the companies to take ESG seriously. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However, as outlined in a whitepaper titled “ESG Portfolio Monitoring – A Best Practice for All Sides” in detail, this pressure is resulting in a backlash from several circles.  Many fund managers believe these ESG regulations sometimes tend to be too harsh, and can affect their ability to perform to ensure maximum returns for their clients.A Key Challenge in ESG InvestingIt’s also becoming increasingly difficult for average investors as well as fund managers and asset owners to assess ESG risks of companies they want to invest in. Apparently, ESG rating agencies solve this problem. They evaluate companies and provide ESG risk scores and ratings based on their analysis. However, these ratings could further confuse the investor. This is the problem highlighted in the whitepaper we referred to above, authored by Steve Glass, the co-CEO of Abel Noser Holdings, a New York-based firm that provides Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) and trade surveillance for investment managers and consultants.Story continuesThe whitepaper argues that because of the lack of standardization and benchmarking in the industry, each ESG ratings agency uses different data sources, methodologies and processes to assess a company. This results in huge variance and subjectivity in ESG scores.The whitepaper recommends using machine learning and AI to resolve this problem. The paper mentions an interesting example of OWL ESG, a California-based ESG analysis company that uses machine learning to process millions of data points from a plethora of sources to come up with consensus ESG ratings. These consensus ratings minimize divergence and discrepancies in ESG ratings.Photo by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used the latest datasets of Just Capital. Just Capital, a not-for-profit founded in 2013 by popular individuals like billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, Deepak Chopra, Rinaldo Brutoco, Arianna Huffington, Paul Scialla, Alan Fleischmann, among others, is striving to solve major problems related to environment, gender, racial justice and equality.Just Capital ranks the largest US companies based on their performance related to issues concerning environment, workers, customers, communities and shareholders. The company comprehensively surveys the American public based on its 241 individual ESG data points to reach its rankings.We focused more on the environmental aspect of the ESG matrix of these companies and talked about the projects and investments these companies have committed to in order to tackle the existential crisis of climate change.Top 12 ESG Companies in 202212. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) is an Illinois-based utilities services company that owns nuclear, fossil, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, and solar generating facilities. According to its ESG report published in June last year, Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) claims to be the largest producer of zero-carbon electricity in the U.S.  In February this year, Exelon completed its split of power generation and competitive energy business.  Exelon’s power generation and retail energy business, now known as Constellation Energy Corp., started trading publicly on February 2. Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)’s CFO Joseph Nigro thinks that the new, simplified structure will make the company more attractive for ESG investors.Investment firm UBS agreed with that notion in a report published after the split, saying: ""Exelon post-spin has a clean profile that fits into most ESG funds metrics, even if an exclusionary, already clean approach is used versus a rate of change approach.”11. PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP)PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in January last year announced that it plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 2040. PepsiCo, Inc.

Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) has set a short-term goal to reach net zero for all global Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025.  Scope 1 emissions are defined as emissions from owned or controlled sources, while Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy.

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has announced plans to generate renewable energy equivalent to 50% of its annual electricity consumption by 2025. The telecom industry is one of the biggest polluters in the world. Verizon says it’s taking steps to lead from the front in solving this problem. The company claims that in 2021 alone, it recycled about 35.5 million pounds of e-waste, including 1.79 million pounds of plastic and 3.4 million pounds of lead-acid batteries. Earlier this year, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) struck 15 new deals related to renewable energy. Among the companies it signed these deals with include Duke Energy, Leeward Renewable Energy and Lightsource BP.8. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)GPU company NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is fighting climate change in a unique, innovative way. The company says it’s building a digital version of our planet on which it’ll apply its AI and Omniverse technologies to predict weather changes and their effects over a span of several decades. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs will also be used to power the Department of Energy’s supercomputer called “Kestrel” which is dedicated to advanced energy solutions.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also striving to cut its carbon emissions. In 2014, the company started asking its manufacturing suppliers to report their greenhouse gas (GHQ) emissions. In its latest Corporate Sustainability report, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) said that its bulk carton packing operations use corrugated material that is 100% recycled fibers.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also partnered with Lockheed Martin AI Centre to solve the problem of wildfires. The companies plan to use machine learning and AI to decrease the response time to wildfires and make wildfire predictions.7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an ambitious goal to become carbon neutral by 2030 and the company is making significant progress towards this goal. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) claims about 20% of the materials used in its products are made from recycled content and that it’s working to increase this figure. Last year, it announced that 175 suppliers have committed to completely shift to renewable energy. According to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s latest ESG report, the company avoided 23 million metric tons of emissions across all scopes. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) also said it reduced its carbon footprint by 40 percent in 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2015.  Apple is also trying to reduce its carbon emissions by coming up with an environment-friendly design. For example, Apple says switching to the Apple M1 chip in its 13-inch MacBook Pro reduced the product’s carbon footprint by 8%.6. PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Payments giant PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced last year that it plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. The company also pledged to use renewable energy to power all its data centers by 2023. PayPal has 13 data centers and 22 points of presence (POPs). Currently, about 50% of the energy used to power its data centers comes from renewable sources. PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) is also eyeing to cut its operational greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2025.PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) is also exploring different horizons in the financial technology segment to solve the climate change problem. It funded the development of Digital Finance for Climate Resilience (DF4CR) Framework for Action which is working on developing climate resilience among financially underserved populations. The company also supports Catalyst Fund, which helps startups working to improve the livelihoods of underserved customers.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022.

REGN is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell.The company has an impressive track record having beaten earnings in all the past four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it beat earnings expectations by 14.54%. It surpassed earnings estimates by 30.54%, on average, in the last four quarters.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayA major chunk of Regeneron’s revenues comes from the sales of its lead drug, Eylea, which is approved for various ophthalmology indications (neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and macular edema, among others). Eylea was developed in collaboration with Bayer AG.Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, while Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the country. Regeneron also records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Eylea sales in the United States in the second quarter increased 13.7%. Sales in the third quarter are likely to have witnessed a sequential increase with growth in demand on label expansions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eylea sales in the United States is pegged at $1.69 billion.Apart from Eylea, investors will focus on the asthma drug Dupixent’s performance, sales of which are recorded by Sanofi SNY. Regeneron has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for drugs like Dupixent and Kevzara. While Sanofi records sales, Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent and Kevzara.  Profits from Dupixent sales have been REGN’s primary growth driver in the last few quarters.Dupixent has maintained its stellar performance on continuous label expansion all through. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Total sales recorded by Sanofi in the third quarter were up 44.5%.  Label expansion of the drug in the past few months is likely to have boosted sales further and resulted in incremental revenues for Regeneron in the third quarter.Story continuesInvestors will focus on the performance of Libtayo and PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent. Effective Jul 1, 2022, Regeneron records net product sales of Libtayo and will pay Sanofi a royalty on such sales. Sales of Libtayo were up 21% in the previous quarter. Sales are likely to have recorded sequential growth in the to-be-reported quarter on label expansions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Libtayo sales is pegged at $149 million.Regeneron records net product sales of Praluent in the United States.  Sanofi records net product sales of the drug outside the United States and pays Regeneron a royalty on such sales. Total sales in the previous quarter were up 10%. Praluent sales are likely to have recorded sequential growth in the third quarter.In January 2022, the FDA revised the authorizations for a few monoclonal antibody treatments, including Regeneron’s REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), as data indicated that these treatments are highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. REGEN-COV is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab, also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987, respectively).  Therefore, REGEN-COV is not currently authorized for use in any U.S. states, territories or jurisdictions. Hence, this revision dented sales in the first half of 2022 from this stream, and sales are likely to have been negligible in the third quarter as well.Recent UpdatesIn September, the FDA approved Dupixent for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis. With this approval, Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the United States.Regeneron also announced that the two studies evaluating aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens in patients with diabetic macular edema and wet age-related macular degeneration were successful.Share Price PerformanceRegeneron’s shares have gained 18.9% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 21.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conlusively predict an earnings beat for Regeneron in this reporting cycle. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Union Pacific's current trading price of US$199 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Union Pacific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific What's The Opportunity In Union Pacific?According to my valuation model, Union Pacific seems to be fairly priced at around 5.3% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Union Pacific today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $209.85, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Union Pacific’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Union Pacific look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 14% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Union Pacific. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in UNP’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UNP, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Union Pacific, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

That major tailwind has since subsided, and while there are still growth opportunities for clinical testing companies, the reduction in Covid-related income has made a wreck of the stock.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with DGX. Click here to check it out. DGX 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DGXPeter Lynch Chart of DGXQuest develops and delivers diagnostic tests and services such as routine testing, non-routine advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing. Key operating brands include Quest, AmeriPath, Dermpath Diagnostics, ExamOne and Quanum. Customers include patients, clinicians, hospitals, independent delivery networks and many more. The company also provides risk assessment services for the life insurance industry.How big was the Covid-19 pandemic boost?Quest was at the forefront in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic and played on important role in terms of broadening access to lab testing. The company provides both molecular diagnostic and antibody serology tests to aid in the diagnosis of Covid-19 and the detection of immune response to the virus. Over 72 million of these tests have been performed. The company built up its logistics network to handle this extraordinary workload and worked with governmental agencies, hospitals, retailers and other organizations. The company also provides data on Covid-19 to federal, state and local public health authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Peak Covid is in the past for the U.S. as hospitalizations and deaths in the country have plummeted, and Quest's revenues have declined as well. Revenues are expected to decline approximately 10% this year from the peak reached in 2021 and decline again in 2023. After 2023, the company says it should resume its normal growth rates.Story continuesFinancial reviewQuest recently reported third-quarter operating results that showed a revenue decline of 10.4% year over year. However, the company does separate its Covid-19 related testing business with its base business, and the base business increased 5.1% compared to the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income declined 39.1% to $423 million due to lower high margin Covid-19 tests, inflationary pressures and investments in growth.Quest typically generates strong levels of free cash flow as it not a capital-intensive business. Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2022 totaled $1.1 billon and the company is calling for $1.3 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Share repurchased year to date totaled $947 million and the divided payouts totaled $230 million.One the balance sheet, the company carries $700 million in cash and equivalents almost $4.0 billion in debt. However, with expected Ebitda this year of approximately $2.0 billion, the companys leverage ratio is not excessive.ValuationQuest provided guidance for 2022 which calls for a total revenue to decline between 9.9% and 8.6%, though it also expects base revenues to increase approximately 5.0%. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $9.75 to $9.95. Consensus analyst EPS estimates are in the middle of that range at $9.81, which puts Quest stock selling at a forward price-earnings ratio of 15. However, EPS for 2023 is expected to decline further due to the ongoing reduction in Covid-19 testing revenues, and most analysts are shooting for $8.50 for 2023 EPS. Forward enterprise-value-to-Ebitda ratios average above 11.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator estimates a fair value for the stock that is close to the current stock price when using next year's EPS estimate of $8.50 as the starting point and an 8.0% long-term growth rate, with an 11% discount rate.The company currently pays an annualized dividend of $2.64, which produces a dividend yield of 1.83% currently. That is slightly above the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield of 1.68%.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased Quest stock recently include Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio) and Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio). Gurus who have reduced or sold out of their positions include Jeff Auxier (Trades, Portfolio) and Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio).ConclusionThe Covid-19 testing drop off will stabilize at some point next year and will still provide a steady stream of high margin revenues going forward. Other possible upsides for Quest include higher levels of lab consolidation, which will be driven by Medicare reimbursement cuts. The company also has plans to monetize its treasure trove of lab data that is has collected. Direct-to-consumer lab testing kits is another potential driver and the company hopes to generate $250 million revenues by 2025 through that channel.The company appears to be fairly valued at this time based on its GF Value, but it will likely be difficult to invest in this range as revenues and earnings are expected to decline for one more year before turning around. Investors may want to wait for the stock price to retreat to lower valuation levels in my opinion as the stock should adjust to the delay in the return of normalized growth.Quest Diagnostics Is a Wreck Amidst Covid-19 Testing DeclinesThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Unveiled at Cisco's annual Partner Summit conference, the news demonstrates continued progress towards the strategic vision of the Cisco Security Cloud that will protect the integrity of an organization's entire IT ecosystem. The end-to-end platform will safeguard users, devices and applications across public clouds and private data centers, without public cloud lock-in.Cisco Partner Summit 2022""Security is no longer optional. It is critical to every major initiative an organization may have,"" said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Security and Collaboration at Cisco. ""We are committed to delivering more value for our partners by continuing to drive innovation and making it easier to do business with Cisco. Partners can land key products and then expand across the Cisco Secure portfolio to increase profitability while enabling customers to securely achieve their digital transformation goals.""Zero TrustDuo Passwordless Authentication is now available for all customers to protect Single Sign On (SSO) applications. Users can login without any password by leveraging biometrics (Windows Hello and Mac touch ID) and security keys. Cisco is also adding the Duo Mobile app as a new option for passwordless authentication. This will simplify implementation and lower the total cost of ownership for customers, as well as better meet the needs of all end-users as global biometric adoption stalled after several years of sharp growth. Among Duo customers, biometrics were enabled on 81 percent of mobile devices.Story continuesThe findings are from Cisco's 2022 Duo Trusted Access Report, also released today. The annual study is based on roughly 1.1 billion monthly global authentications, an increase of 38 percent year-over-year, across more than 49 million devices and 490 thousand unique applications.""Passwordless authentication reduces the risk of phishing attacks and their ability to utilize stolen passwords or as we've seen more recently, MFA fatigue,"" said Dave Lewis, Global Advisory CISO at Cisco. ""As cyberattacks continue to move closer to end-users, there is a huge opportunity to embrace low-friction authentication methods that ensure only trusted users and devices gain access to applications and corporate resources.""Network SecurityEmployees are going back in the office. Among Duo customers, remote access authentications declined since peaking in 2020, reaching lower than pre-pandemic levels in 2022. As hybrid work becomes the new normal, organizations are demanding high-performance network security without the increased cost.To better meet the needs of customers, Cisco is introducing the newest addition to the Secure Firewall 3100 Series, the first firewalls purpose-built for hybrid work. Secure Firewall 3105 expands sizing options for branch offices at a price point accessible to more organizations. It empowers hybrid workers with support for more remote users and increases VPN speed and performance by 17X.Initially launching in the US, Cisco Capital is now offering Cisco Lifecycle Pay for Secure Firewall, a Cisco Capital fixed term subscription payment solution, to provide a financial incentive and lower total cost of usage without the burden of ownership. Customers can receive a 10 percent replacement incentive when returning existing firewall hardware and upgrading to Cisco's latest qualifying firewall technology. Cisco Capital offers a global suite of segment-and architecture-agnostic payment solutions that enable partners to better support their customers and match their buying preferences.Secure ConnectivityAs critical resources are moved into cloud, customers are concerned about data vulnerability. The challenge is only growing, as authentications to cloud applications increased 24 percent in 2022. Data needs to be protected, not just because of the risk tied to malicious threat actors, but the unintentional issues caused by inexperienced users. To help with this, Cisco is enhancing Umbrella with stronger data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities, including unified policies and reporting across API-based out-of-band DLP, and real-time inline DLP, making management easier for security teams.Umbrella is a foundational component of Cisco+ Secure Connect, Cisco's unified Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solution. Highlighting their abilities with the integrated networking and security architecture, partners can now achieve SASE specialization to help customers securely enable cloud development and deployment, remote work, and edge computing.Supporting Quotes""The breadth and depth of Cisco's security portfolio provides our customers with resilience in the wake of an ever-shifting threat landscape, letting us drive more value with a strategic, full stack approach."" – Stephanie Hagopian, VP Security Solutions, CDW""Password management is a challenging proposition for many enterprises, especially in light of BYOD and ever increasing sophistication of phishing schemes.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Trading At A 43% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-110057068.html,1667300457,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$15.8bUS$16.7bUS$16.6bUS$16.3bUS$17.0bUS$17.2bUS$17.4bUS$17.6bUS$17.9bUS$18.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.91%Est @ 1.23%Est @ 1.46%Est @ 1.61%Est @ 1.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$14.8kUS$14.6kUS$13.6kUS$12.6kUS$12.3kUS$11.6kUS$11.0kUS$10.5kUS$10.0kUS$9.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$121bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$393bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$393b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$205bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$326b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$45.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.012. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the ESG investing dynamics and challenges in the industry, you can go directly to read Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022. Over the past few years the concept of ESG has evolved dramatically. Environmental, Social, and Governance principles no longer belong to the vague realm of fancy words but rather play a key role in investing circles. Environmentally-conscious investors and activist hedge funds now pay serious attention to ESG metrics of companies before making investment decisions. Data from Bloomberg Intelligence shows that global ESG assets are expected to surpass a whopping $50 trillion by 2025.Regulatory pressure from governments around the world is also causing the companies to take ESG seriously. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working to develop a common benchmark on how sustainable products are assessed and reported. However, as outlined in a whitepaper titled “ESG Portfolio Monitoring – A Best Practice for All Sides” in detail, this pressure is resulting in a backlash from several circles.  Many fund managers believe these ESG regulations sometimes tend to be too harsh, and can affect their ability to perform to ensure maximum returns for their clients.A Key Challenge in ESG InvestingIt’s also becoming increasingly difficult for average investors as well as fund managers and asset owners to assess ESG risks of companies they want to invest in. Apparently, ESG rating agencies solve this problem. They evaluate companies and provide ESG risk scores and ratings based on their analysis. However, these ratings could further confuse the investor. This is the problem highlighted in the whitepaper we referred to above, authored by Steve Glass, the co-CEO of Abel Noser Holdings, a New York-based firm that provides Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) and trade surveillance for investment managers and consultants.Story continuesThe whitepaper argues that because of the lack of standardization and benchmarking in the industry, each ESG ratings agency uses different data sources, methodologies and processes to assess a company. This results in huge variance and subjectivity in ESG scores.The whitepaper recommends using machine learning and AI to resolve this problem. The paper mentions an interesting example of OWL ESG, a California-based ESG analysis company that uses machine learning to process millions of data points from a plethora of sources to come up with consensus ESG ratings. These consensus ratings minimize divergence and discrepancies in ESG ratings.Photo by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we used the latest datasets of Just Capital.

The company also pledged to use renewable energy to power all its data centers by 2023. PayPal has 13 data centers and 22 points of presence (POPs).

It funded the development of Digital Finance for Climate Resilience (DF4CR) Framework for Action which is working on developing climate resilience among financially underserved populations. The company also supports Catalyst Fund, which helps startups working to improve the livelihoods of underserved customers.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 ESG Companies in 2022.
